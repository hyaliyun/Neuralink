In designating the al-Nusra Front as a foreign terrorist organization and an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. State Department has put flesh on the bones of its policy of discriminating between the \\"bad\\" Syrian rebels and the \\"good\\" ones. But the decision is getting mixed reviews in Syria. Rebels in brigades fighting around Aleppo have told CNN that the move is a miscalculation. Their argument goes something like this: \\"The U.S. and the West in general have given us next to no help while we've witnessed thousands die at the hands of Bashar al-Assad's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies. \\"Al-Nusra Front is one of many groups that are fighting the OPTIONS: - Al-Nusra regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Aleppo regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Bashar al-Assad regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - CNN regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Iraq regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Islamic regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Syria regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Syrian regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - U.S. regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - U.S. State Department regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - West regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al Qaeda regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al-Nusra regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al-Nusra Front regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - post-Assad Syria regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation.","completion":"Bashar al-Assad regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. The US State Department's designation has raised concerns for a number of reasons, particularly as it comes at a crucial moment in the ongoing conflict. By choosing to label the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization, the US has sent a strong message to other groups within the Syrian opposition: that they must distance themselves from extremist factions if they want to continue receiving international support. However, many Syrian rebels argue that the designation is counterproductive. They believe that the move could potentially fracture the fragile alliance between various rebel forces, making it more difficult for them to cooperate and coordinate their efforts against the government of Bashar al-Assad. Moreover, they argue that the al-Nusra Front has been instrumental in the fight against the Assad regime thus far, and that its members' extreme views do not necessarily represent the majority of the opposition. The mixed reactions to the designation highlight the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the delicate balance of power among the various rebel factions. The policy of differentiating between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" rebels is a difficult one for the US and other Western nations as they strive to support the opposition while minimizing the risk of inadvertently aiding extremist groups with potential ties to terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda. In the coming weeks and months, the impact of the al-Nusra Front's designation on the conflict in Syria will become clearer. It is possible that some rebel factions may choose to distance themselves from the extremist group, working more closely with the US and other Western nations in their pursuit of regime change. However, if the designation serves to alienate the al-Nusra Front and fracture the opposition further, it could ultimately lead to increased fighting and instability within the region. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story indicates that while the US State Department has aimed to differentiate between the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" rebels by designating the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization, the consequences of this decision remain uncertain. Although the move might encourage other rebel factions to disassociate themselves from extremist elements and strengthen their ties with the West, it could also potentially undermine the unity of the Syrian opposition, making it even more difficult to achieve a resolution to the conflict."},{"prompt":"Teacher:This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

Solve this instance: Passage: British colonial rule in the region of modern-day Malawi, where the revolt occurred, began between 1899 and 1900, when the British sought to increase their formal control over the territory to preempt encroachment by German or Portuguese colonial empires. The region became a British protectorate in 1891 and in 1907, was named Nyasaland. Unlike many other parts of Africa, where British rule was dependent on the support of local factions, in Nyasaland British control rested on military superiority. During the 1890s the colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by the local Yao, Ngoni and Cewa peoples. British rule in Nyasaland radically altered the local indigenous power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most of the land acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the demand for labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata. Student:","completion":"1.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1944, Rachel Stein, a Dutch-Jewish singer who had lived in Berlin before the war, is hiding from the Nazi regime in the occupied Netherlands. When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory. Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Ludwig MÃ¼ntze, bleaching all of her hair blonde. MÃ¼ntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises ObersturmfÃ¼hrer GÃ¼nther Franken, MÃ¼ntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with MÃ¼ntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that her hair is bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care. She also becomes friends with her Dutch colleague Ronnie, who collaborates with the Germans, working for them, being sexually available to them (particularly Franken), and accepting stolen gifts from them.

It highlights the Dutch Resistance against the Nazi regime, Rachel Stein's duplicity, and her background as a singer. The word \\"Echoes\\" signifies the reverberations of the past events and secrets, while \\"Resistance\\" refers to the Dutch fighters who risk their lives to protect their own. \\"The Songbird's Deception\\" portion of the title emphasizes Rachel's (also known as Ellis de Vries) unique role within the Resistance and the sacrifices that she makes in order to carry out her mission. As a singer, she is referred to as a \\"songbird,\\" an innocent and beautiful creature. This reflects her initial innocent identity, which stands in stark contrast to the cunning and duplicitous life she soon leads. The deceptive persona, Ellis de Vries, intensifies the suspense and drama in the film, as she navigates her dangerous relationships with both fellow resistance members and treacherous Nazi officers. Overall, the title \\"Echoes of Resistance: The Songbird's Deception\\" captures the essence of this complex and thrilling movie plot, showcasing a heroic resistance story filled with betrayal, love, and sacrifice, intertwined with one woman's incredible transformation in order to survive and fight during one of the darkest periods in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: 1) The people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are Serbs or of Serbian origin, therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. For instance, they mentioned that the diaspora Croats (the so called \\"Ustase\\") played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia, but they didn't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well (Cetniks)! For you who aren't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history: The Serbian so called \\"Cetniks\\" that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well, that's only half the truth. They were also a fascist (Monarch) group who collaborated with the Germans, but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It's also ironic that they don't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious. 2) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I've studied this war for a long time (who is the old British lady!!! She really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name, so they could More or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows. 3) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to Serbia (even though they are a minority). Well, when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia (Krajina) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine, but what people don't know is that the largest city in Krajina (Knin) has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no, the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus, it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority. 4) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is \\"The death of Yugoslavia\\" where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. Milosevic, Jovic, Bulatovic, Tudman, Izetbegovic, Karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war. One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called \\"Muslim Croats\\") they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get.

Their estates were confiscated and their families relocated — Zrinski's wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in the Dominican convent in Graz where she fell mentally ill and remained until her death in 1673, two of his daughters died in a monastery, and his son Ivan Antun died in madness, after twenty years of terrible imprisonment and torture, on 11 November 1703.

Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction. - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed. - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - George David Atherton , known as Gee Atherton ( born 26 February 1985 , near Salisbury , England ) is a professional racing cyclist specialising in downhill and four cross mountain bike racing , and is a multiple national champion , multiple World Cup winner , 2010 Downhill World Cup Champion , and 2010 & 2014 Downhill World Champion . - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games). - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. - Mountain bike racing (shortened MTB or ATB racing) is a competitive cycle sport held on off-road terrain. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised the discipline relatively late in 1990, when it sanctioned the world championships in Durango, Colorado. The first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup series took place in 1988. Its nine-race circuit covered two continentsEurope and North Americaand was sponsored by Grundig. Cross-country racing was the only World Cup sport at this time. In 1993, a six-event downhill World Cup was introduced. In 1996, cross-country mountain biking events were added to the Olympic Games.

Answer: Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. Question: how tennessee became a state Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"how Tennessee became a state\\", I will provide a brief overview of the process, while also fact-checking the statement provided. Step 1: Research and fact-check the statement - Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796: This statement is true. Step 2: Explain the process of Tennessee becoming a state 1. Territorial formation: In 1784, settlers in western North Carolina (now eastern Tennessee) formed the State of Franklin in an attempt to gain independence. However, the State of Franklin was not recognized by the U.S. government, and it failed in 1789. 2. Southwest Territory: In 1790, North Carolina ceded its western lands to the federal government, leading to the formation of the Southwest Territory, which included present-day Tennessee. 3. Territorial growth and development: Under the leadership of Governor William Blount, the Southwest Territory experienced significant population growth and development. The new settlers drafted a constitution and petitioned for statehood. 4. Request for statehood: In 1795, a territorial census revealed a population of over 60,000 free residents, which met the requirement of the Northwest Ordinance for statehood. 5. Creation of a state constitution: In January 1796, a convention was held in Knoxville to draft a state constitution. This constitution was completed in February 1796. 6. Admission to the Union: On June 1, 1796, Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state. To summarize: Tennessee became a state after the region experienced significant growth and development under the Southwest Territory administration. When the required population was met, a constitution was drafted and submitted to the U.S. government, leading to the admission of Tennessee as the 16th state on June 1, 1796."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The body of Laura was stronger than Jennifer because Select from: *Laura was a bodybuilder by profession.. *Jennifer was a bodybuilder by profession..","completion":"The body of Laura was stronger than Jennifer because Laura was a bodybuilder by profession. As a bodybuilder, Laura committed to a disciplined, rigorous lifestyle that aimed at maximizing her muscular strength and size. This process involved a combination of intense resistance training, carefully calibrated nutrition, and adequate rest to facilitate muscle growth and recovery. Her profession thus placed her in an optimal position to outperform Jennifer in terms of physical strength. Laura's resistance training consisted of various exercises targeting different muscle groups through a process known as periodization. By strategically varying her routine, she was able to work on specific muscles at different times and give other muscles adequate time to recover. This approach allowed Laura to stimulate muscle growth consistently while minimizing the risk of overtraining and injury. When it came to nutrition, Laura followed a well-crafted diet plan that provided her with all the macronutrients and micronutrients her body needed to build muscle and maintain overall good health. Her diet was high in protein, moderate in carbohydrates, and low in fat to promote muscle synthesis and provide the necessary energy for her training sessions. Moreover, she also consumed various supplements, such as protein powders, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids, to support her training goals. In addition to exercise and nutrition, an important factor in Laura's success was allowing her body enough time to recover. During sleep, the body produces hormones like growth hormone and testosterone, which facilitate muscle growth. Laura ensured a consistent sleeping schedule to maximize muscle recovery and come back stronger in her next workout routine. On the other hand, Jennifer, who was not a professional bodybuilder, might have engaged in some form of physical activity, but her training and nutrition were likely not at the same level as Laura's. Since Jennifer's primary focus was not on achieving maximum muscle hypertrophy and strength, her musculature and overall strength would be less developed than Laura's. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"Laura was a bodybuilder by profession.\\" Laura's dedication to her profession, coupled with her intensive training, disciplined nutrition, and recovery routine, played a vital role in forging her superior physical strength compared to Jennifer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a great album, but it is a bit overrated by everybody. Though if you are a real Maiden fan and you don't have Number Of The Beast in your collection, what are you waiting for?

Answer:","completion":"The given review appears to have both positive and negative aspects that could influence my decision to purchase the product, which in this case is Iron Maiden's \\"Number Of The Beast\\" album. However, by analyzing the review in more detail, I can determine whether it would increase or decrease my chances of buying the album. Positive Aspects: 1. Number one album: The fact that this is Iron Maiden's first number one album already increases its appeal and shows that it was well-received by fans and critics alike. 2. Great album: The reviewer explicitly mentions that it is a great album, which indicates that the content is of high quality. 3. For real fans: The reviewer emphasizes that this album is a must-have for genuine Iron Maiden fans, suggesting that it is a vital addition to their collection. 4. Music style: The description of the music as loud, heavy, and reminiscent of the good days of heavy metal would appeal to those who appreciate that style and genre of music. Negative Aspects: 1. Overrated: Despite the positive feedback, the reviewer mentions that the album is a bit overrated by everybody. This could imply that perhaps the album's hype and success might be disproportionate to its actual quality. 2. Ambiguous recommendation: The use of the word \\"bit\\" when describing the album's overrated status leaves room for interpretation. It can be seen as a minor flaw or as a red flag that might cause potential buyers to reconsider. Considering both the positive and negative aspects of the review, there is an overall positive tone. However, I would say that the review's impact on my decision to purchase the album would depend on my personal preferences as well as how strongly I weigh the importance of the overrated aspect. If I am an avid Iron Maiden fan or a fan of heavy metal music in general, this review would likely increase my chances of buying the product. In this case, the positive aspects may outweigh the concern about the album being overrated, as I would be more focused on completing my collection or enjoying the loud, heavy music described in the review. On the other hand, if I am a more casual fan or have diverse music tastes, the review might decrease my chances of buying the album. The fact that it is overrated could make me hesitant to invest in a product that might not live up to its hype. In conclusion, the impact of this review on the chances of buying the product would largely depend on the individual's music preferences and how they value the potential drawbacks of the album being overrated. The review presents a balanced perspective, highlighting the album's impressive achievement as a number one product and its significance for true Iron Maiden fans while also acknowledging the potential concerns about its universal acclaim. Therefore, the decision to buy the album would ultimately be influenced by the potential buyer's priorities and musical inclinations."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Article: It's Sunday.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain?, using the article: At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The major habitats of the location lying at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, as described, are mainly peat bogs, particularly Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog that occupies about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2). It lies 75 feet (23 m) above sea level and is mainly located in Salford with an extension into Wigan. Chat Moss is categorised as a lowland raised bog, which typically forms due to the accumulation of peat, a substance produced when plant material, in marshes or damp regions, decomposes. The formation of these peat bogs is a result of a combinative effect of the flat topography of the region and the underlying layer of boulder clay that results in poor drainage, thus creating conditions favourable for water-logging. This results in slower plant decomposition and consequently produces peat. Over the years, the accumulation of peat raises the level of the bog, setting it above that of the surrounding land. Chat Moss extends between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of the location of the former River Irwell, now the Manchester Ship Canal. By the 1990s, around 72% of Chat Moss had been reclaimed, predominantly for agriculture. However, there still remains about 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog, along with about 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The depth of the peat varies, ranging from 24 feet (7 m) to 30 feet (9 m). The main flora of the peat of Chat Moss is distinguished by the presence of Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia, which are species of bog mosses. Apart from these, A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line (Astley & Bedford Mosses) was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1989. It, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) by the European Union. These areas are specifically designated due to their scientific interest and the unique habitats and species they support, contributing to biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Itâs at a bereavement therapy group that meets on the Southwest Side of Chicago far from her North Shore home where Tina Nelson has found some measure of comfort and validation as she copes with her sonâs sudden and violent death. Grant Nelson was killed in May while driving for ride-share company Uber. A 16-year-old Chicago girl is accused of attacking him with a knife and a machete that authorities say she had just stolen from a Walmart in Skokie. Since July Tina Nelson has been attending a support group for crime victimsâ families thatâs held each month at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago. Tina Nelson had experienced other losses in recent years. A sister-in-law died unexpectedly of a brain aneurysm. And just a month before Grant another sister-in-law lost a âtorturous battle with cancer.â But her sonâs death is âa different sphere of experience â Tina Nelson said. âYou have to reconcile the fact that someone chose to take the life of your loved one â said Tina âs daughter Alex Nelson who also has been attending the bereavement group. âIt is not a freak accident or illness. Itâs that someone made a conscious choice and that adds to the grieving process. You are not just mourning the person. You are trying to reconcile the feelings about (the accused) whether it be forgiveness or anger.â Tina and Alex Nelson spoke with the Tribune on Dec. 4 â what would have been Grantâs 35th birthday â about how the family is coping. Tina Nelson describes how she finds herself daily longing to talk to him particularly to tell him things she knows he âd find funny. She demonstrated how he would throw his head back when he laughed. He had âthe best laugh â she said. âI miss his laugh.â â It has been a lifesaver for my husband and myself â she said. â It âs the camaraderie. You get to know people that walked in your shoes. And no one looks down at you. They are all sympathetic.â Tina Nelson said she âs found the bereavement group so helpful that she was moved to write to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to tell her .

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country. Question: Why did the caller call out the steps for the dancers? - Because the dance was invented by the caller. - Because the dancers didn't know the names of the steps. - Because the steps were very particular. - Because it was hard for the dancers to remember all the steps. A:","completion":"The reason the caller called out the steps for the dancers was because it was hard for the dancers to remember all the steps. As the square dance evolved over time in America, the dance steps became increasingly intricate and complicated. Dancers originally had to memorize all the steps for a particular dance, but with the addition of more complex routines, it became challenging to recall every step accurately. Consequently, the role of the caller was introduced. The caller was someone who would call out the dance steps in time to the music, providing cues for the dancers so they didn't have to remember so many steps. The presence of a caller administering instructions made the dance easier to follow and allowed dancers to enjoy the experience without the burden of memorizing a multitude of steps.

This would affect the oxygen exchange in the following ways: 1. Direct impact: The primary function of alveoli in the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the air and our bloodstream. Oxygen is taken into the blood, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed. If carbon dioxide doesn't enter the alveoli, this gas exchange is disrupted, affecting the balance and efficiency of the process. 2. Indirect impact: When carbon dioxide does not get adequately removed, it can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to a condition called hypercapnia or excessive carbon dioxide levels. High levels of carbon dioxide can lead to respiratory acidosis, which occurs when the blood becomes too acidic. This, in turn, impacts the body's ability to transport and release oxygen efficiently. Additionally, excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream may cause dilation of blood vessels, impairing the ability of the circulatory system to effectively deliver oxygen to cells and tissues. Overall, if carbon dioxide doesn't enter the alveoli, it directly disrupts the gas exchange process in the lungs, leading to indirect consequences that can negatively affect oxygen transport and availability to the body's cells and tissues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the first sentence entails the second sentence, answer with '1', else answer with '0' Solution: Sentence 1: Anibal Cavaco Silva, a former prime minister, won Portugal's presidential election on Sunday. Sentence 2: New Portuguese prime minister is elected. The first sentence tells us that Anibal Cavaco Silva, who was a former prime minister, won the presidential election in Portugal. While the second sentence is talking about the election of a new prime minister. These two statements are not directly related as the first sentence is talking about a presidential election, not a prime minister election.

Unbeknownst to them, Debbie is a serial killer known as the Black Widow; she marries rich bachelors and murders them on their wedding night so she can collect their inheritances. After Debbie seduces Uncle Fester, Wednesday becomes suspicious. To get rid of her, Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and her brother Pugsley want to go to summer camp. They are sent to Camp Chippewa, run by the overzealous Gary and Becky Granger, where they are singled out for their macabre dress and behavior. Joel, a nerdy bookworm who also does not fit in, becomes interested in Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged. At their bachelor and bachelorette parties, Debbie is horrified by the Addams family. On their honeymoon, she tries to kill Fester by throwing a radio in the bathtub, but he survives. Frustrated by his resilience, Debbie forces him to sever ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester at Debbie's mansion, they are removed from the premises. At home, the Addams find to their alarm that Pubert has transformed into a rosy-cheeked, golden-haired baby.

In order to do this, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Since 264 is being multiplied by x, we should divide both sides of the equation by 264. -3960 ÷ 264 = (264*x) ÷ 264 This simplifies to: -3960 ÷ 264 = x Step 3: Perform the calculations on the left side of the equation. -3960 ÷ 264 = -15 So now we have: x = -15 Therefore, the value of x that makes the equation true is x = -15."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After several years of service and expansion, the airline was fully privatized in 1969. - Seoul () officially the Seoul Special City is the capital and largest metropolis of the Republic of Korea (commonly known as South Korea), forming the heart of the Seoul Capital Area, which includes the surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province, the world's 16th largest city. It is home to over half of all South Koreans along with 678,102 international residents. - The Hanjin Group ( Hangul : ; hanja : ; RR : Hanjin Geulub ) is a South Korean conglomerate , or Chaebol . The group is a holding company that includes a shipping company , Hanjin Shipping ( including Hanjin Logistics ) , and Korean Air ( KAL ) , which was acquired in 1969 .

Ltd is a South Korean integrated logistics and container transport company. Prior to its financial demise, Hanjin Shipping was South Korea's largest container line and one of the world's top ten container carriers in terms of capacity. In August 2016, the company applied for receivership. - Terminology. The term \\"zaibatsu\\" was coined in 19th century Japan from the Sino-Japanese roots \\"zai\\" (\\"wealth\\", from Middle Chinese \\"dzoi\\") and \\"batsu\\" (\\"clique\\", \\"group\\", from MC \\"bjot\\"). Although \\"zaibatsu\\" themselves existed from the 19th century, the term was not in common use until after World War I. By definition, the \\"zaibatsu\\" were large family-controlled vertical monopolies consisting of a holding company on top, with a wholly owned banking subsidiary providing finance, and several industrial subsidiaries dominating specific sectors of a market, either solely, or through a number of subsubsidiary companies. - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

The receivership remedy is an equitable remedy that emerged in the English Chancery courts, where receivers were appointed to protect real property. Receiverships are also a remedy of last resort in litigation involving the conduct of executive agencies that fail to comply with constitutional or statutory obligations to populations that rely on those agencies for their basic human rights. - A chaebol (, ; from \\"chae\\" \\"wealth or property\\" + \\"bol\\" \\"faction or clan\\" also written with the same Chinese characters as Zaibatsu) is a South Korean form of business conglomerate. They are typically global multinationals and own numerous international enterprises, controlled by a chairman with power over all the operations. The term is often used in a context similar to that of the English word \\"conglomerate\\". The term was first used in 1984.

Write some highlights for the following article: Three-dimensional models of a 'priority area' in the Indian Ocean have been revealed as the search for MH370 ramps up. In the images huge mountains, deep trenches and dormant volcanoes are seen strewn across the search area - but there's no sign of the plane yet. The search for the plane is set to resume later this month, and mapping the ocean floor is essential to ensure the survival of underwater equipment that will be used. Three-dimensional models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been revealed. They will be used to direct deep-sea equipment when the search for the plane resumes later this month. The maps reveal various features include large ridges and deep trenches (shown) Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean on 8 March with 239 people on board, and no sign of the plane has been found since then. It has been widely reported that better maps of Mars exist than this portion of the sea floor where the plane is thought to be located, so the new maps will be key in the hunt for the plane. The models show the designated MH370 search area, which includes the seabed around an area known as Broken Ridge. 8 March 12:21am. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departs from Kuala Lumpur, south west Malaysia, due to land in Beijing at 6.30am the same day. On board are 227 passengers and 12 crew. 1.20am. Eight villagers report seeing lights in the sky and hearing noise in the Marang area of north east Malaysia. 1.30am. Air traffic control makes its last recorded sighting of air traffic control. The plane is last seen on civilian radar above the waters where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. 1.45am. Several sightings of the planet are reported, including a businessman in Kora Bharu and a bus driver in Penaruk. 2.15am. Military radar detects what could be the jetliner 200 miles north west of Penang Island in the Northern Malacca Strait. The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area formed when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago creating mountains, volcanoes and trenches. Seamounts - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. These large geological structures are typical of two such spreading plates. Structures include rugged ridges that reach heights of 985ft (300 metres) and trenches that are up to 4,590ft (1,400 metres) deep. At the end of this month the search will resume to try to find any sign of MH370 in this area. This will include using a deep-sea search vehicle attached to a boat by an armoured cable 6.2-miles (10km) long. Knowing where ridges and volcanoes lie is vital to ensure the equipment does not crash into an unseen object while underwater. The vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep-sea vehicles around them. Later this month equipment will be lowered on a cable to search the seabed using sonar and other techniques to try and find MH370. The maps reveal raised areas (shown) that will need to be dodged by underwater vehicles. The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area was created when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago, forming large mountains, volcanoes and trenches (shown) ‘The recently acquired high-resolution bathymetry data [the study of ocean floors] has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,’ the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a statement. ‘It is also revealing finer-scale seabed features that were not visible in the previous low-resolution, satellite-derived bathymetry data.’ The new 3D models were maid using high resolution survey data, including satellite gravity measurements and some ocean passage soundings. Identification of the features will assist in navigation during the underwater search phase. The estimated location of MH370 in this area was derived from a series of brief pings - electronic ‘hellos’ - from the plane to a satellite before it disappeared. And it's hoped some sign of the plane will finally be found when the search starts again. The deep sea search vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Seamounts (shown) - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared without a trace in the early hours of 8 March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777 with the registration number 9M-MRO is seen here on a previous flight over Poland on 5 February 2014 before its final flight. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Today, we are going to learn how to make yummy potato and egg cutlets. Cutlets are small, yummy round-shaped foods that look like mini burgers. They are super fun to make and eat. So, let's get started! Ingredients you'll need: 1. Potatoes 2. Eggs 3. Breadcrumbs (those are tiny, dried pieces of bread that help make our cutlets crispy) 4. Oil (to cook our cutlets) Step 1: Wash, Peel, and Cook the Potatoes First, we need to clean our potatoes. Ask for help from a grown-up to wash the potatoes with water. Then, with the grown-up's help, carefully peel off the potato skin. Peeling means taking off the outer layer, like when you remove the skin of a banana. Once the potato skin is removed, ask the grown-up to cut the potatoes into smaller pieces. Now, it's time to cook the potatoes. In a big pot, boil some water and put the potatoes inside. Cook the potatoes in the water until they become soft. When they are soft, it's easy to mix them and shape them into cutlets. Step 2: Prepare the Eggs and Breadcrumbs Now, we need two medium-sized bowls. In the first bowl, break some eggs and mix them together. In the second bowl, pour some breadcrumbs. We will use these two bowls to coat our cutlets before frying. Step 3: Make the Cutlets Take the cooked potatoes and mash them with a fork or potato masher until they are smooth. Mash like you're playing with playdough! Then, shape the mashed potatoes into small, round cutlets - like mini hamburgers. Dip each potato cutlet into the egg bowl first, and then into the breadcrumbs bowl. Make sure the cutlets get covered with eggs and breadcrumbs so that they become super crispy and yummy. Step 4: Fry the Cutlets Ask your grown-up helper to put some oil in a frying pan and heat it up. Be careful, hot oil can be dangerous! With the grown-up's help, gently place each cutlet into the hot oil. The cutlets need to cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn golden and crispy. When the cutlets are done, use a spatula to carefully place them on a plate with a paper towel to remove extra oil. That's it! Now, your yummy potato and egg cutlets are ready to eat. Enjoy your homemade cutlets with your favorite sauce or toppings. Happy cooking, little chefs!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career....

Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. But I can use this background: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. What is an answer for this question: Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A?

The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality. Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work. Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this. This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person.

Question: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was the daughter devestated?

Write an article with the title: \\"Virginia Order on Felon Voting Restoration Unconstitutional\\"","completion":"Title: Virginia Order on Felon Voting Restoration Unconstitutional Step 1: Introduce the topic In this article, we will discuss the controversial order from the Virginia governor aimed at restoring the voting rights of felons, and why this order is being viewed as unconstitutional by critics. Providing a holistic view, we will dissect the arguments made by those who oppose the order and explore the implications for Virginia's criminal justice system and the state's political landscape. Step 2: Summarize the order In 2016, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that restored voting rights to over 200,000 convicted felons who had completed their sentences, including those on probation or parole. The basis for this order was to remove the lifelong voting ban on these individuals and to foster their reintegration into society. Step 3: Present the arguments against the order Critics argue that the Virginia order on felon voting restoration is unconstitutional for several reasons. They claim that: 1. The governor overstepped his authority: Opponents assert that Gov. McAuliffe exceeded the powers granted to him by the Virginia Constitution, which only allows for restoration of voting rights on an individual basis. By restoring the rights of an entire class of individuals en masse, the governor is said to have circumvented the intended checks and balances within the state government. 2. Violation of the separation of powers: Rivals claim that the order infringes on the legislative branch's authority to determine voting qualifications. By unilaterally restoring voting rights to large groups of felons, the governor effectively altered the qualifications for voting without proper legislative action. 3. Politically motivated decision: Detractors highlight that a significant number of affected individuals belong to demographic groups that traditionally lean Democratic. They suspect that the move might have been an attempt to manipulate voter demographics in favor of the Democratic Party. Step 4: Discuss the implications of the order If the Virginia order on felon voting restoration were deemed unconstitutional, it would have several implications: 1. Voting rights rollback: Thousands of felons who had their rights restored would once again be disenfranchised, further hindering their reintegration into society and potentially affecting their ability to contribute positively as citizens. 2. Legal battles: A decision against the order could prompt legal challenges and appeals, creating a prolonged legal tug-of-war that may drain resources and divert public attention from other pressing issues. 3. Impact on the political landscape: An invalidation of the order could stir political tensions and perhaps lead to polarization, as it could be perceived as stripping voting rights from citizens – a fundamental aspect of democracy. Step 5: Concluding thoughts The Virginia order on felon voting restoration has sparked a heated debate over its constitutionality and the scope of a governor's power. Regardless of the outcome, it remains crucial to strike a balance between the competing goals of protecting the democratic process and ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to participate in it. Ultimately, the weight of the decision lies with the judicial system, and its resolution will certainly have lasting effects on both the felons and the state's political climate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because the Pick your answer from: A. sift was simple to use. B. machine was simple to use.","completion":"The sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because the sift was simple to use. In a world where technology is constantly advancing and complex machinery is becoming increasingly prevalent, sometimes, it's best to return to the basics. Although there are certain advantages associated with using a machine, in this instance, the simplicity and ease of use associated with the sift made it the clear choice for accomplishing our objective. One of the primary reasons that the sift was ultimately selected over the machine is due to the minimal learning curve associated with its use. While machines may streamline the sand-filtering process, they can also be complicated to operate and maintain. On the other hand, a sift is an uncomplicated tool consisting of a mesh and a frame. This setup allows anybody, regardless of their experience with machinery, to easily pick up the sift and begin filtering sand without requiring extensive training or previous knowledge. Additionally, the simplicity of the sift provides several logistical benefits. A machine may require a power source and operational maintenance, as well as repairs and replacement parts when necessary. These factors can lead to increased cost and environmental impact over time. In contrast, a sift requires little to no maintenance, is not reliant on external power sources and is less likely to break, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option in the long run. Moreover, the sift's simplicity fosters a greater degree of control over the sand-filtering process. With a machine, users may be limited in their ability to manipulate variables such as the force exerted or the size of the grains filtered. Conversely, using a sift allows for direct, hands-on control over these variables, granting the user the ability to tailor the filtering process to their specific needs. Furthermore, the use of a sift can promote mindfulness and attentiveness in a way that relying on machinery may not. By requiring manual action and oversight, the sift encourages users to be present and focused throughout the entire filtering process. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the sand and its properties, as well as an appreciation for the work being done. Lastly, using a sift can instill a sense of personal accomplishment that may not be present when relying solely on a machine. There is a unique satisfaction that comes from knowing that you've directly contributed to a project and achieved your goals through personal effort and determination. In conclusion, while machines possess several benefits and may often represent a rational choice for accomplishing various tasks, the decision to use a sift for filtering sand in this scenario was primarily due to its simplicity and ease of use. In instances like these, it's essential to carefully consider the advantages and drawbacks of each available tool before making a final decision to ensure that the most suitable and effective option is selected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Bernanke Hints at Possible Sale of Mortgage Assets In testimony Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke did not depart from the Fed’s stance that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero for “an extended period,” given that unemployment remained high and inflation was expected to remain low. But he offered a glimpse into his thinking about the timing and pace of the Fed’s eventual withdrawal from its monetary policies of the last two years. The Fed’s balance sheet has grown to about 2.3 trillion, about 2.5 times its size before the crisis. The central bank bought up mortgage-backed securities, Treasury securities and debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates as the economy went into a tailspin in 2008. In addition, the Fed created several emergency lending programs to pump credit into the economy. While the lending programs have mostly ended, the giant balance sheet, which includes a large volume of bank reserves that the Fed created as it bought the assets, poses a difficult challenge for Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Bernanke was originally to testify before the Financial Services Committee about the Fed’s exit strategy on Feb. 10, but the hearing was postponed because of a snowstorm. “I currently do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will sell any of its security holdings in the near term, at least until after policy tightening has gotten under way and the economy is clearly in a sustainable recovery,” Mr. Bernanke wrote in that testimony, which was released after the hearing was postponed. On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke omitted reference to “the near term.” He said, “Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies.” The Fed plans to experiment with two tools, reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, to drain the large store of bank reserves and replace them with other liabilities. Those tools would not change the overall size of the balance sheet. “If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities,” Mr. Bernanke said. He was careful to avoid specifying a time frame, but he told Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, “We would like to get back to an all-Treasury portfolio within a reasonable amount of time.” Traditionally, the Fed bought and sold Treasury securities to lower and raise the key interest rate it controls, the federal funds rate. Later, in response to a question from Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Bernanke said, “My expectation is that sales would be slow, gradual, announced in advance and would not create undue market impacts.” Even if the Fed were to do nothing, the balance sheet would slowly shrink as the securities mature or as Fannie or Freddie redeem their debts. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had no intention of holding onto the securities — some of them backed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages — indefinitely. “We certainly don’t want to hold this stuff for 30 years,” he told Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey. The Fed’s exit strategy is untested, and several economists who testified after Mr. Bernanke warned of potential risks. Marvin Goodfriend, of the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, warned that reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities with an agreement to buy them back later a slightly higher price, could expose the Fed to private sector risks. He said that term deposits, analogous to certificates of deposit, would also compete with Treasury bills and “potentially cause friction with the Treasury.” John B. Taylor, an influential Stanford economist, said the Fed might want to follow an “exit rule,” reducing reserve balances by 100 billion for each 0.25 percent increase in the federal funds rate. Other economists were more optimistic about the choices the Fed faced. Laurence M. Ball, of Johns Hopkins University, said the Fed should not raise rates “until we see major progress in reducing unemployment,” even if inflation starts to rise. A moderate rise in inflation, he said, could even be good for the economy. Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, testified that the risk of high inflation was remote unless the central bank came under political pressure. “The Fed is operating in uncharted waters,” he warned. “It has never had such a challenging exit. Don’t expect the Fed to be perfect. Nobody is perfect.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Which is likely less dense diamond or ball? Assuming that: A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Answer:","completion":"To determine which is likely to be less dense between a diamond the size of a beach ball and a beach ball itself, it is important to understand the concept of density and how it relates to the mass and volume of an object. Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance, which can be mathematically expressed as: Density = Mass / Volume The density of a substance is an important property that can help identify an object's buoyancy, as well as its ability to withstand certain forces and pressures. The main idea behind this question is to understand that for a given volume, a denser substance weighs more than a less dense substance. Now, let's consider the given objects - a diamond the same size as a beach ball and a beach ball. 1. Diamond the size of a beach ball A diamond is a crystalline form of carbon and is known for its superior hardness and strength. The density of diamond varies depending on factors like impurities, crystal orientation, and pressure; however, its average density is around 3.5 g/cm³. 2. Beach ball A beach ball, on the other hand, is typically made of lightweight materials such as PVC or plastic material, which is less dense than a diamond. The exact density of a beach ball's material can vary depending on the manufacturing process and materials used, but it is generally much lower than that of a diamond, approximately around 0.9-1.5 g/cm³. Given the nature of the question, we can assume that the diamond and beach ball have the same volume. As we already know, the density of the diamond is around 3.5 g/cm³, and the density of the beach ball material is approximately 0.9-1.5 g/cm³. Recalling the initial assumption that a given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance, it becomes evident that the diamond has a higher density compared to the beach ball material. Therefore, the beach ball is likely to be less dense than the diamond of the same size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Title: Airport '77 Movie plot: A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100, Stevens' Flight 23, flies invited guests to an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens, who also owns the jetliner. Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic.

Alan Victor White (born 26 May 1972 in Lewisham, South London) is an English rock drummer, best known as being the drummer of the English rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. White replaced original Oasis drummer Tony McCarroll in May 1995 and was immediately \\"thrown in the deep end\\", joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of \\"Some Might Say\\" in front of a national TV audience on BBC1's long running music programme Top of The Pops. One of White's first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995. Until the arrival of Andy Bell in the Autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the otherwise Mancunian Oasis. Initially known as 'Whitey', he was later re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from \\"The Winchester\\" in the '70s TV series Minder. White commented on the \\"North/South divide\\" saying it was not that bad, but \\"for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'\\". In his book What's the Story? Ian Robertson (who served as Oasis' tour manager from 1994 to 1995) stated that White was also known by the phrase \\"Alan White - He's alright\\". White was also entrusted with the job of being Liam Gallagher's 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as 'Bert and Ernie', named after the Sesame Street-characters. In December 2002 Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar. Consequently, Liam lost some of his front teeth, and White needed a brain scan after suffering minor head injuries. Both were arrested by the authorities and were released only after the band's management paid for their bail. Noel Gallagher has stated that White had a far greater significance to the band than a mere session and touring drummer, claiming that he helped immensely in the recording process. Noel also said that when he wrote a song he would play it to White who would often adapt the rhythm of the song or advise Gallagher on possible changes in the tempo. At the time of his departure White was the longest-serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers (he has since been passed by Andy Bell) and passed through thin and thick with the brothers despite being struck down several times with bouts of alleged tendinitis during his later years with the band. White performed on four of Oasis' studio albums: (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), Be Here Now (1997), Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000) and Heathen Chemistry (2002). He also played on the majority of band's B-sides, some of which were released on the record The Masterplan (1998). White married model Liz Atkins on 13 August 1997 at Studley Priory Hotel, Oxfordshire. He had met her on the set of the \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" music video. The couple divorced in 2000.

After a terrible car accident that left her comatose for six weeks, Emptage emerged to discover that her memories had been wiped clean from the past decade. With fuzzy recollections from the 1990s and no memories of her life after the age of 22, the now 40-year-old mother from County Durham had a harrowing journey ahead of her to rediscover her life and make sense of her new reality. In an unfortunate turn of events, Emptage was driving her car when she suddenly collided with an ambulance. Firefighters in Gateshead leaped into action, rescuing Emptage and transporting her to the hospital for immediate medical attention. After an agonizing battle for survival, Emptage awoke from her coma to find herself in a world that she couldn't recognize or comprehend. In her mind's eye, she remained a youngster in her early 20s, when the Spice Girls dominated the charts and it was still the era of the 1990s. Confused and disoriented, Emptage believed that she had aged only recently, though she had in fact turned 40. But the most devastating consequence of the memory loss was her inability to recognize her own daughter, Maddie, who was by then 14 years old. Moreover, Emptage could not recall her boyfriend at the time, intensifying her sense of confusion and disarray. With only the memories of her experiences as a 22-year-old former model, Emptage's journey to reclaim her past was ardorsome but necessary. During her rehabilitation in the hospital, she had to relearn even the most basic of human functions, such as walking. In an instant, more than a decade of memories had vanished, forcing her to start anew. Candace Emptage's incredible story highlights the fragility of our memories and the challenges that individuals face when living through such traumatic experiences. Her resilience and determination to overcome this life-altering event is a testament to the human spirit and the power of perseverance. As Emptage continues to rediscover her life and piece together the puzzle of her past, her journey serves as an inspiration for anyone grappling with their own adversities and obstacles."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ?, using the article: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 09:38 EST, 11 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:35 EST, 12 July 2013. George Osborne has started wearing a hi-tech wristband which makes sure he gets a good night’s sleep. The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he uses the UP wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime. The black plastic Jawbone wristband links up with a smartphone app to allow users to take a ‘holistic approach to a healthy lifestyle’. Grilling: George Osborne was seen wearing the black wristband while giving evidence to the Treasury select committee. Worries that senior ministers are struggling to sleep at night seem to be spreading in government. It has emerged that Education Secretary Michael Gove has also taken to wearing a Jawbone wristband. Mr Osborne’s black version was first spotted as he gave evidence to the Treasury select committee this morning. It. was visible under the cuff of his right sleeve as he was grilled on his. plans for tax and spending. He has also been seen wearing it while out. running. Later he told. journalists that the gadget, which costs around £100, was given to him. as a birthday present when he turned 42 in May. What it shows. The technology works by monitoring. whether the user is in deep or light sleep and only wakes them at the. best time so they start the day feeling refreshed. It. also monitors physical activity 24/7, providing a record of the. Chancellor’s morning jog around St James’ Park near the Treasury. It. also makes it ‘fun and easy’ to keep track of what users eat, although. it is not known if he used it to record eating a Byron burger in the. Treasury on the eve of his Spending Review speech last month. The up device links in to a smartphone app which provides an on-screen 'daily dashboard'. Gift: The Chancellor revealed the £100 Jawbone gadget was a gift for his 42nd birthday in May. Active: The gadget tracks the wearer's movements 24 hours a day, including when the Chancellor goes jogging in central London. Manufacturers Jawbone say that the system 'not only visualizes your information so you can understand the meaning behind the numbers, it also discovers hidden connections in the way you live to deliver powerful insights. Over time, insights lead to new behaviors and new behaviors become new, healthier habits'. The wristband tracks movements during sleep to record periods of light and deep slumber and waking moments during the night. Its precision motion detection system captures a complete record of daily activity - or inactivity. Users can create a database of their diet by scanning barcodes and taking photos of their meals. Nutrition: The app can also be used to track what the user eats, including the Byron burger the Chancellor was pictured eating on the eve of his Spending Review last month. Mr Osborne explained why he was using it as he addressed a press gallery lunch with journalists in Westminster. He said: ‘It was a birthday present. It measures how far you walk but it also measures your sleep patterns, your deep and light sleep. ‘I was pleased to note yesterday that Michael Gove was also wearing one.’ Asked how it is helping him to relax at night, the Chancellor replied: ‘I always sleep well.’ The UP device markets itself as a way to 'KNOW YOURSELF LIVE BETTER' There have been portable fitness gadgets on the market for many years now, but the Jawbone UP was the first designed to live full-time with its user. First released in 2011, it was withdrawn because of technical problems. After being totally re-engineered, it was relaunched the following year. However some blogs and reviews have claimed that the new, remodelled wristband still has glitches, with some people saying theirs stopped working shortly after buying the product, others claiming it records false information and some complaining it disrupts their sleep. Costing around £100, the portable personal trainer tracks a person’s eating habits, sleep and exercise - syncing with an app on a user’s mobile phone to offer advice about how to be healthier. From the moment a person wakes - by vibrating at the 'best' possible moment according to sleep patterns - the machine monitors everything they do, prompting the wearer to get up and move if they have been sat still, and even to 'log' everything they eat. Jawbone describe the UP as 'attractive, durable, water-resistant and unobtrusive' and even suggests it can be worn with a cocktail dress as easily as with gym kit. Inside the wristband is a motion sensor which stores steps, calories burned, distance, and active versus inactive time. The motion sensor even tracks the user while they sleep - tracking their movement to gauge when they fall asleep, how long it takes, and how much deep sleep they’re getting. If that wasn't enough, the iPhone app prompts the user to take photographs of every meal, and tracks where, when and what they have eaten. A 'Feed' screen on the mobile phone then offers an up-to-date stream of information about how a person is progressing with respect to your health. It also links with online 'health challenges' to set you tasks to achieve during the week. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Possible answers: --different meanings; --the same meaning;","completion":"The word \\"serve\\" has slightly different meanings in the two sentences provided. In general, the verb \\"serve\\" refers to the action of performing a service, duty, or function. However, its interpretation varies based on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence - \\"They serve a restricted role on the bench.\\" - \\"serve\\" refers to fulfilling or executing a particular function or duty. In this context, the individuals mentioned are limited in their capacity or the scope of their responsibilities while being a part of the bench or panel, likely in a judicial setting. This restricted role might be due to several factors such as experience, the nature of the case, or the jurisdiction's regulations. Thus, the emphasis here is on the fulfillment of a specific function with certain limitations. In the second sentence - \\"She served in Congress for two terms.\\" - \\"serve\\" refers to holding a particular position of authority and responsibility as a public servant. In this context, the individual is actively participating in the political process and representing her constituents in Congress for the duration of two terms. In this case, the emphasis is on the tenure and completion of the elected term. Although both meanings are related to carrying out a duty or responsibility, the first usage highlights limitations in the role, while the second highlights representation, participation, and completion of elected terms. Therefore, the word \\"serve\\" has slightly different meanings in the contexts provided. In conclusion: --different meanings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost.

These two questions you asked are not the same. They're about different things. In the first question, you're asking about the range of a function. This is like asking where a bird can fly. Some birds can fly high in the sky, and some birds can also dive in the water. So, the range would be from the sky to the water. In math, the range of a function is all the possible answers we can get. To find the range, it's somewhat like solving a puzzle. You don't really have a specific formula but you look at the function and figure out what answers you could possibly get. Sometimes it might go from very low (negative infinity, like digging a hole to the center of the earth) to very high (positive infinity, like a rocket going to space).

Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \\"the greenhouse effect\\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension? ? Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English: chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic. The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals; some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words. House music developed in Chicago's underground dance club culture in the early 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering the pop-like disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. As well, these DJs began to mix synth pop, rap, Latin, and even jazz into their tracks. Latin music, particularly salsa clave rhythm, became a dominating riff of house music. It was pioneered by Chicago DJs such as Chip E., and Steve Hurley. It was influenced by Chicago DJ and record producer Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago acid-house electronic music group Phuture, and the Tennessee DJ/producer Mr. Fingers. The genre was originally associated with the Black American LGBT subculture but has since spread to the mainstream. From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre spread internationally to London, then to American cities such as New York City and Detroit, and eventually globally.Chicago house music acts from the early to mid-1980s found success on the US dance charts on various Chicago independent record labels that were more open to sign local house music artists. These same acts also experienced some success in the United Kingdom, garnering hits in that country.

With her bulging forehead, double chin and thin pursed lips, Jane Seymour was no oil painting…if Tudor oil paintings are to be believed. Twenty-first century actresses, meanwhile, tend to have a natural beauty. Which has left the makers of the BBC's big budget adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall with something of a dilemma. Scroll down for video. Historian Lucy Worsley has reportedly said that Kate Phillips, pictured left, who plays Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour, portrait pictured right, in BBC drama Wolf Hall is too pretty. While they have gone to great lengths to nail down historical details for the drama, they have been accused by a TV historian of casting a woman who is 'too pretty' to play Henry VIII's third wife. The public largely gets its image of Seymour from the portrait of her by Tudor artist Hans Holbein, depicting her with a noticeably large forehead. However, she is played in the series by Kate Phillips, 25, who cannot be faulted when it comes to her looks. According to Lucy Worsley, 41, chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Miss Phillips – in her first professional role – has features which are too dainty. Miss Worsley said: 'She's too pretty. I did challenge Peter Kosminsky [the director] about that. He laughed and said, 'I picked her because of her acting, not because of her forehead'.' Homeland star Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry's court. But, speaking yesterday, the historian said it was not a remark she would extend to the whole cast, which includes Homeland star Damien Lewis, 43, and Claire Foy, 30. She said: 'They are not all fantastically good looking, are they? 'Mark Rylance [who plays Thomas Cromwell] has a wonderful craggy, creased face and, on the whole, as a cast I would say they are human rather than beautiful. It's not like it's been turned into a pageant show.' Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at the University of Oxford, said he didn't see Miss Phillips' beauty as a problem: 'Ideas of beauty change from century to century and you might as well make them beautiful on our terms, because it's quite possible that the portraits of Jane Seymour that we've got were meant to flatter and give the impression that she was a beautiful woman.' Historians also pointed out that Montacute House in Somerset, which was used to portray Greenwich Palace, is Elizabethan. Author Dame Hilary has said courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available. She also said members of the court would not have been covered in filth. He continued that while the show is not an 'exact fit on the history', it is an impressive 'evocation of the period'. Wolf Hall, which starts tomorrow night on BBC Two, is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels. Miss Worsley questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme, claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day. She said: 'What Hilary Mantel has done is made these characters people for our times, which is interesting for a historian to watch. They are immensely modern, they won't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top. 'I think it will make people think the Tudors were just like us in many ways. That's a massive historical question, in some ways they were and in some ways they weren't.' The programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight, white teeth and pristine linen. Mantel said a Tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"The BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall has faced criticism from TV historian Lucy Worsley, who claimed that actress Kate Phillips is \\"too pretty\\" to play Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife. Worsley argues that Phillips' features do not align with the historical portrait of Jane Seymour by Tudor artist Hans Holbein. However, the director of the adaptation, Peter Kosminsky, defended the casting choice, saying he picked Phillips for her acting skills rather than her physical appearance. Other historians such as Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch argue that beauty standards change from century to century and that it is possible that Jane Seymour was considered beautiful in her time. The series, which is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels, has placed emphasis on historical accuracy; however, Worsley questions the authenticity of some aspects of the program and the modernization of its characters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the title of this article: The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically cognate or related to the standard language, but not actually derived from it. In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \\"dialect,\\" as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, the \\"dialects\\" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves. For example, most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy, often colloquially referred to as Italian \\"dialects,\\" are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy. These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \\"dialects\\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents. These variations on standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would more appropriately be called \\"dialects\\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \\"dialect,\\" as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.

Then gave no trouble to his mom after she spent his butt. Given the context: What will Quinn want to do next? Answer:","completion":"Without additional context, it's challenging to ascertain what specifically Quinn will want to do next. However, if the context suggests that Quinn was causing trouble and his mother disciplined him which resulted in him not causing any further trouble, there's a good chance that Quinn may try to behave better to avoid further discipline. Here's how I arrive at this prediction: 1. Analyze: The given sentence suggests that Quinn has been given a punishment (his mother spanked him) for some misbehavior. After the punishment, there's mention that he was not causing any more trouble for his mother. 2. Understanding Human Behavior: It's common human behavior, especially in children's case, to seek to avoid unpleasant situations. In this case, the unpleasant situation for Quinn was getting in trouble and being disciplined by his mother. 3. Predicting: Using that understanding of human behavior, we can predict that Quinn might want to behave better in order to avoid getting in trouble again. This would entail refraining from actions that his mother disapproves of. So, it's likely that Quinn's next course of action may be trying to behave better or possibly doing something pleasing to his mother to show that he has listened to her and understood his mistake. However, this is just a predicted behavior based on given context and human behavioral patterns, actual actions may vary based on Quinn's personality and individual reactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Angry and violent protests against austerity measures continue to flare across Europe, with thousands of students across Italy fighting cutbacks. Thousands of university and high school students clashed with Italian police during a number of marches in major cities, including Rome, Milan and Naples, where the crowds chanted slogans and carried banners such as ‘save schools not banks’. Up to six policemen were wounded in Rome, police said, after students wearing motorcycle helmets and carrying home-made shields pelted them with stones and tried to rush a police van before being driven back in a baton charge. Students wearing motorcycle helmets clash with police in Rome where six officers were injured. A demonstrator lights a flare during one of the protest in Turin, where a number of students were arrested for scuffles. The protests were the latest in a string of strikes and large-scale street protests against prime minister Mario Monti's spending cuts and economic reforms. ‘The protest is to renew the political class, to get rid of those who are corrupt,’ said Giulio Bianco, 18. ‘The politicians make the ordinary people pay. These are heavy sacrifices, and it is a risky policy to keep imposing them,’ the high school student from Rome said. TV pictures from Bologna showed students throwing eggs at a branch of UniCredit bank and trampling on a BNP Paribas flag, while in Palermo protesters burnt copies of political manifestos. Young people have borne the brunt of rising joblessness in Italy, where the youth unemployment rate is 35 per cent, more than three times the overall level. ‘We are worried about our prospects and about the future of our country,’ Madalina Ursu, 19, told Reuters.

Another students carrying a banner is held back by a group of police after they regain control of the street. Yesterday in Greece police clashed with shipyard workers protesting pay arrears, after they broke into the Defence Ministry grounds, which led to more than 100 arrests. Meanwhile hundreds of farmers on tractors tried to invade the country's second-busiest airport in Crete during an anti-austerity protest. Greece has been gripped by a severe financial crisis since late 2009, and waves of spending cuts and tax hikes have led to frequent strikes and demonstrations. The nation's three-month-old coalition government is currently preparing a major new austerity package demanded by rescue creditors. Unions have promised new protests and a general strike next week when the government's new 13.5 billion Euro program is debated in parliament - where the conservative-led coalition controls enough seats to pass the measures. A protestor is dragged to the floor in Turin, while another covers herself on the ground, surrounded by police. A coloured smoke bomb is released by a student during the marches. Yesterday in Athens more than 100. protesters forced open the shuttered entrance to the defence ministry. complex, crossing the courtyard and blocking the entrance to the general. staff building. Riot police were called in to force back the demonstrators, who were demanding to meet with ministry officials. Greece's. top military officer, General Michalis Kostarakos, was heckled by the. shipyard workers when he came out to speak to them by using their. portable loudspeaker. ‘First. get off my base,’ Kostarakos told the protesters, arguing that the. military had no part in the workers' dispute with the government. Police said 106 people were detained for questioning, prompting another protest gathering outside police headquarters and court building today. Misdemeanor charges were filed against the protesting shipyards workers, 94 of which were detained at the scene and subsequently released, while another 12 individuals were sent before an Athens first instance prosecutor. Riot police used pepper spray to prevent a group of protesters from barging into the building. Shipyard workers support their arrested colleagues when they are taken with handcuffs before a prosecutor at a court in Athens, Greece. Policemen escort two arrested shipyard workers to the court today following their protest yesterday. A shipyard worker raises his fist after being released from court. Charges were filed against 106 protesting shipyards workers after they broke down a barricade and entered the government's defence ministry. Workers from the Skaramangas Shipyards, which deals mainly with military contacts, say they have not been paid in months. Scuffles broke out as protesters tried to push through the police cordon protecting the entrance to the main building. On the southern island of Crete, hundreds of farmers taking part in an anti-austerity protest yesterday tried to invade the terminal and the runway of Iraklio airport. Police kept them off with tear gas, and one man was detained for trying to drive his tractor onto the runway. Airport authorities said flights were not affected by the protest. Crete is a major tourist destination, attracting more than 44,000 flights last year. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said earlier this week that there were still considerable differences between the government and Greece's debt inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank over the new austerity package. But he said he hopes to clinch a deal by next week. The country has been in recession since 2008, and the total contraction is projected to reach a cumulative 25 per cent at the end of next year.

Take some small sections of the pillow of one side and wrap them one after the other in rubber bands for some patterns. Take the bowl and put the pillow slowly and carefully in the bowl.","completion":"The most logical next event, continuing from your given instructions, would be to follow through with dyeing the pillowcase to create a unique and colorful addition to your summer-inspired room décor. Here are the steps to complete the process: 1. After heating the water and yellow dye mixture for fifteen minutes, make sure to turn off the stove and let the dye solution cool down to a safe temperature. In general, you can wait for about 10-15 minutes for it to become safe enough to handle. 2. While the dye solution is cooling down, proceed with creating a pattern for your pillowcase. To do this, gather some small sections of the pillowcase and wrap each with rubber bands. You can create simple patterns such as stripes, circles, or any design that you prefer. The sections that are tightly wrapped with rubber bands will resist the dye and remain white, while the rest of the pillowcase will be dyed yellow. 3. Once the dye solution has cooled down to a safe temperature, carefully lower the rubber banded pillowcase into the diluted dye. Depending on how deep you want the color to be, you can leave the pillowcase submerged in the dye solution for 15 minutes to an hour. For a more vibrant and deeper yellow, leave the pillowcase in the solution for a longer time. 4. When you're satisfied with the color, carefully remove the pillowcase from the dye solution and rinse it under cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear, ensuring that you've removed all excess dye. 5. Once fully rinsed, gently remove the rubber bands from the pillowcase, being careful not to tear the fabric. You'll be able to see the unique pattern you've created. 6. Allow the pillowcase to air dry or throw it in the dryer for a quicker drying process. After completing these steps, your dyed pillowcase is ready to be used in your summer-themed room. You can now proceed with decorating the room using the various ideas you mentioned previously, such as placing batting, colorful ribbons, and sequins around the room, using vibrant colors that add personality to space, and utilizing elements like paper and sea glass decor. Make sure you balance and complement the colors and materials to create a visually appealing and refreshing summer atmosphere.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members or the resignation of Liang Shiyi?","completion":"Title: The Order of Historical Events: Amnesty for Former Cabinet Members and Liang Shiyi's Resignation Introduction In our exploration of history, establishing the correct chronology of events is crucial for understanding cause and effect relationships, as well as the broader context of the time. In this article, we will investigate which happened first: the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members or the resignation of Liang Shiyi. We will delve into the historical context of these events and establish their order in terms of timing. Background Before discussing the two events in question, it is essential to establish their historical context. Liang Shiyi (1869-1933) was a prominent politician in China's late Qing and early Republican periods. He served in various high-ranking government roles, including those of Finance Minister and Premier. As for the amnesty, it is worth mentioning that throughout history, various governments have granted amnesties to former cabinet members, which can either be a political tactic or a means to advance reconciliation. The Resignation of Liang Shiyi Liang Shiyi's resignation as the Premier of the Republic of China took place on May 25, 1922. He took office in September 1921, and his term was marked by the tensions between different political groups. The underlying pressure and criticism from various political factions and the public eventually led to his resignation. His departure from the post represented the end of an era of his political career. The Granting of Amnesty to Former Cabinet Members Amnesty for former cabinet members has occurred on numerous occasions throughout history. For the purpose of our investigation, we will focus on an amnesty granted by the Beiyang government in China – the same historical context as Liang Shiyi's resignation. This amnesty happened on June 5, 1923, when then-President Li Yuanhong declared a general amnesty for individuals, including former cabinet members who have committed political crimes or have been implicated in such actions. Comparison of the Two Events Upon examining the dates of these events, it becomes clear that Liang Shiyi's resignation took place on May 25, 1922, while the amnesty for former cabinet members in the Chinese context occurred on June 5, 1923. Therefore, Liang Shiyi's resignation as Premier precedes the granting of amnesty by almost a year. Conclusion In conclusion, the resignation of Liang Shiyi as Premier of the Republic of China took place first, followed by the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members, both occurring in the context of the Beiyang government. An accurate understanding of historical chronology is crucial for a comprehensive appreciation of the past, as it lays the foundation for further analysis of events down the line."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Context: Joy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \\"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \\"really became apparent as the songs got slower\\", and their music took on a \\"sparse\\" quality. According to Reynolds, \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \\"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \\"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands). Sumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \\"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\\". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody. Hannett \\"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \\"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \\"sound separation\\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \\"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \\"crucial\\". There are \\"devices of distance\\" in his production and \\"the sound is an illusion of physicality\\". Question: Did their music sound differently from getting slower? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Joy Division's music did sound different when it got slower. As they moved from their punk roots and the songs became slower, their music became more unique, with a \\"sparse\\" quality. The band's sound changed with Hook's bass carrying the melody, Sumner's guitar leaving gaps, and Morris' drums following the rhythm of the band. This slower and more distinct sound set Joy Division apart and helped them become pioneers of the post-punk movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plans for the area's first directly elected mayor have been scrapped and the relevant legislation withdrawn. On Tuesday four of the seven North East Combined Authority councils decided to halt plans amid fears over post-Brexit funding from the government. Mr Javid was \\"very disappointed\\" they had voted against the \\"ambitious and far-reaching devolution deal\\", he said. Sunderland, Durham, Gateshead and South Tyneside councils said they were not satisfied with reassurances over funding following the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland councils said they remained committed to the plan. \\"It is with regret that we have therefore withdrawn the legislation that would have brought this deal to life, which means local people will miss out on over £1bn of investment,\\" Mr Javid said. \\"Handing power back to Northerners is a key part of our plans to build a Northern Powerhouse and our focus now will be on working to secure a new agreement for residents in those areas committed to progressing with devolution.\\" North East Combined Authority chairman Paul Watson said it was \\"very disappointing\\" the government had chosen to end discussions.

Please answer this question: Which English football team are nicknamed the Tractor Boys?","completion":"The English football team nicknamed the \\"Tractor Boys\\" is Ipswich Town Football Club. Established in 1878, Ipswich Town Football Club (ITFC) is a professional association football club based in the town of Ipswich, Suffolk, England. The nickname \\"Tractor Boys\\" has its origins in the predominantly rural nature of the surrounding Suffolk region and is a reference to the agricultural roots and history of the area. Ipswich Town Football Club has a long and illustrious history in English football. For the majority of their existence, they have played their home games at the iconic Portman Road stadium, which currently has a capacity of approximately 30,000. The stadium has a lively atmosphere and a passionate fanbase that has proudly supported the club across various leagues. Ipswich Town has experienced various degrees of success since its inception. The club achieved their first significant milestone in 1962 when they were crowned as the champions of the English First Division (now known as the Premier League) under the managerial guidance of the legendary Sir Alf Ramsey, who later led the English national team to victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. This triumph positioned Ipswich Town as one of the dominant forces in English football at the time. The club's most successful era came in the 1970s and 1980s, under the management of another iconic figure, Sir Bobby Robson. During this period, Ipswich Town won the FA Cup in 1978, and three years later, they secured the prestigious UEFA Cup in 1981. The club also regularly qualified for European competition in those years, competing against the continent's elite clubs. Over the past few decades, however, their fortune has somewhat dwindled. Ipswich Town currently competes in the English Football League (EFL) One, which is the third tier of the English football pyramid, after being relegated from the EFL Championship in the 2018-19 season. The \\"Tractor Boys\\" are working hard to regain their status as a formidable force in English football and seek a return to the upper echelons of the game. In conclusion, the \\"Tractor Boys\\" nickname belongs to the Ipswich Town Football Club in England. With a rich history and a strong connection to their Suffolk home, the team and its supporters hold on to their agricultural nickname with pride and look forward to returning to the top levels of English football in the near future."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"The autumn storms had what effect on the North Sea by 1870?\\" Context: \\"The French Marines and naval infantry intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III.

As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The autumn storms of the North Sea had the effect of forcing the return of French ships, diminishing the blockade of north German ports and eventually leading the French navy to abandon the blockade for the winter by 1870."},{"prompt":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose records were played by the Japanese over the loudspeakers to make US soldiers homesick? While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: While your friend might usually love a spur of the moment visit, recovering from surgery is a different matter entirely. Not only do hospitals often have specific visiting hours, your friend might need to prepare physically and emotionally for visitors. Know the hospitals visiting hours and policies. Depending on where in the hospital your friend is staying, there is different protocol for visitation. If your friend is still in the recovery room, for example, only one visitor at a time is permitted, with the nurse's permission and supervision, and there are stricter rules for personal hygiene. Call the hospital ahead of time to ask about visiting hours and any restrictions. Try to reach a family member or spouse to see when would be a good time to visit. This way, you'll have a better idea of how your friend is feeling, what tests have been run, and whether they're up for visitors. Once you know, plan your visit accordingly. Call or text once more before heading out to make sure your presence is still welcome. Plan to stay about 20 or 30 minutes, but use your judgment. If your friend seems tired or disengaged, you should slip out sooner. If they seem happy to see you, and are excited to talk to you, then feel free to stay longer. A lot of things can be bothersome to patients just out of surgery, so make sure you do not do anything to cause your friend discomfort during your visit. Do not wear perfume, aftershave or strong smelling lotions as people are often sensitive to smells when they're sick or recovering from surgery. In addition, many healthcare facilities are now fragrance-free. When you enter and leave a friend's room, wash your hands with soap, water, alcohol rubs, or hand sanitizer. Check with the nurses' station before entering the room, as you could be required to use a gown, gloves and/or a mask. People are more susceptible to germs after an operation. If you have any type of illness, such as a a cold or flu, ask the hospital staff beforehand if it's safe for you to visit your friend, as it usually isn't. If you are a smoker, only smoke in designated areas and do not get cigarette fumes anywhere near your friend. Due to the risk of bacteria and germs spreading, you could be banned from the hospital if you bring a non service dog into the hospital. Do not swear as this is usually against hospital rules and can get you thrown out and/or banned if caught. Avoid the patient's bed, as this can spread germs. Do not sit or put your feet on the bed. Do not touch the patient's wounds or any medical equipment they are attached to. Do not use the patient's toilet or bathroom, this can also spread germs and bacteria, and nurses may also report you and have you removed from the hospital. Do not share any property, such as toiletries or tissues, with a patient. People love to receive gifts, especially if they're not feeling well. It's not about the money spent, but just knowing that a person cares. Consider bringing a small gift to your friend for them to enjoy post-surgery. Many people think to bring flowers, but flowers are not ideal for a hospital stay. They take up a great deal of room, and shelf-space in a hospital room is limited. They also decay quickly, and are hard to transport home. Boredom is a huge issue with hospital patients, so consider an interactive gift. Try novels, magazines, crossword puzzle, sudoku books, or a journal. If your friend has some kind of electronic media, like an iPad or tablet, try iTunes or Amazon gift certificates, so they can select and purchase entertaining media for themselves. If food is allowed, bring the patient their favorite snack, as hospital food can get tiresome. However, keep in mind that even if you mean well, they might not want to eat, as surgery and medications can affect their appetite. Many patients are placed on special diets following surgery, and some patients may not be allowed to eat until normal bowel function returns, such as after a bowel resection surgery. A hospital can be a drab, impersonal space. If your friend is there for a prolonged recovery period, try to make their hospital room feel less alien by creating a homey environment for your friend. Decorate the room. Hospital rooms are beige or white and this can grow depressing with time. Bring cheerful posters, a small decorative hanging, or colorful blankets and throw pillows. Just check with hospital staff first to make sure you're not violating any hospital policies. Bring them something familiar. During a traumatic event like a surgery, familiarity can be a comfort. Make a small scrapbook of friends, family members, beloved pets, and other loved ones. Borrow your friend's iPod and create custom playlist of their favorite feel better songs or burn them a mix CD. Buy DVD's of their favorite movies and TV shows, as many hospital rooms have a television set patients can use. Act natural when visiting. Your friend is probably eager to get back to a sense of normal, so share news of mutual friends and discuss what's been happening in the news or on TV. Let your friend feel like they're part of the world even if they are stuck in a hospital room. If possible, and after you make sure your friend is up to it, get a group of friends together to visit your friend. Group visits can feel like a more natural hang out session than one-on-one communication, as people often congregate in groups. Your friend will also be happy to see how many people care and have taken the time to visit. Check hospital policy to make sure there isn't a cap on the number of people permitted in a room at a time. Making some future plans and promises can give your friend something to look forward to after their hospital stay, and reassurance their needs won't be forgotten once they're released. Set a date to go see a movie, go out to dinner, get coffee, go shopping, etc., sometime after they will be released from the hospital. Your friend will appreciate having something small to look forward to after their stay is over. Offer any assistance in the transition back home, such as driving your friend back from the hospital and running errands for them during recovery. Summary:","completion":"Visiting your friend in hospital after their surgery takes a bit of careful planning. Hospitals usually have particular visiting hours and rules you need to follow, so it's best to give them a call before you go. This way you know things like how long you can stay, if you need to wear special things like a gown, gloves or mask to keep germs away, and if it's okay for you to be there if you're feeling a bit sick yourself. You should also check to see that your friend is feeling up to having visitors. When you visit, keep your friend comfortable by not wearing strong smells and not touching their bed or medical stuff, because that can spread germs. Also, remember to wash your hands properly! A little gift can really cheer up your friend - perhaps a puzzle book, a magazine, or even a little snack if they're allowed to eat. And if your friend will be in hospital for quite some time, why not decorate their room a little, to make it feel more like home? Try to act normal and give your friend a sense of life outside the hospital and even plan some future visits or activities for when they're feeling better. Just remember, always follow the hospital rules to keep everyone safe and healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Renewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at.

Answer the following question: This article: Grunge guitarists \\"flatly rejected\\" the virtuoso \\"shredding\\" guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs, instead opting for melodic, blues-inspired solos – focusing \\"on the song, not the guitar solo\\". Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill. In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had \\"guitar anti-heroes\\" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument.In Will Byers' article \\"Grunge committed a crime against music—it killed the guitar solo\\", in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge. He states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement. The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana \\"killed the guitar solo\\". Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the \\"death of the guitar solo\\"; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo. Baeble Music calls the grunge guitar solos of the 1990s \\"..raw\\", \\"sloppy\\" and \\"basic\\".Not all sources support the \\"grunge killed the guitar solo\\" argument. Sean Gonzalez states that Pearl Jam has plentiful examples of guitar solos. Michael Azerrad praises the guitar playing of Mudhoney's Steve Turner, calling him the \\"... Eric Clapton of grunge\\", a reference to the British blues guitarist who Time magazine has named as number five in their list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\". Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready has been praised for his blues-influenced, rapid licks. The Smashing Pumpkins'... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who stated that when other major grunge bands, such as Nirvana, were reducing their guitar solos, Soundgarden responded by bringing back the solos?, what is it ?

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko? is inside the article: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of..., can you guess it ?","completion":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is M.I.A.'s son, Ikyhd. The heartbeat recording took place when Ikyhd was a one-year-old baby, and it was incorporated into the composition and recording process for M.I.A.'s third studio album."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: +Right before flowering, cut the stems 1 inch under the ground. You can harvest one mint plant two or three times in one growing season. You can also just pick the leaves as you need them. You can grow the plants indoors for fresh leaves throughout the winter; +Right before flowering, cut the stems 1 inch from the ground. You can harvest one mint plant two or three times in one growing season. You can also just pick the leaves as you need them. You can grow the plants indoors for fresh leaves throughout the winter;","completion":"Both choices provided are excellent ways to harvest mint. Let me expand on each choice with more detailed information: Choice 1: In this method, you harvest the mint right before it starts flowering by cutting the stems 1 inch under the ground. This process involves the following steps: 1. Identify the right time to harvest: The best time to harvest mint is just right before flowering, which typically occurs between late spring and mid-summer, depending on the climate and mint variety. 2. Use clean and sharp shears: Clean and sharpen your cutting tool to ensure that you make a clean and precise cut. This helps minimize stress on the plant and prevents the spread of diseases. 3. Cut the stems 1 inch under the ground: Carefully cut the stems 1 inch below the soil line. This promotes new growth and helps the plant to regenerate quickly. 4. Harvest in the morning: It is ideal to harvest mint plants in the morning, as the essential oils in the leaves are most potent during that time. 5. Rinse and dry the harvested mint: Before use, rinse the mint stems in cold water and gently shake off the excess water. Then, pat the stems dry with clean paper towels or a soft cloth. 6. Regrow your mint plants: Mint plants can be harvested two or three times in a single growing season. As you cut the stems, the plant will continue to grow and produce more leaves. 7. Growing indoors: You can also grow mint plants indoors and use the leaves throughout the winter. These plants grow well in containers or small pots placed near a sunny window. Choice 2: In the second choice, the main difference lies in cutting the stem 1 inch from the ground instead of under the ground. Here are the steps: 1. Follow steps 1-2 of Choice1 to select the right time and prepare your cutting tool. 2. Cut the stems 1 inch from the ground: In this case, cut the stems 1 inch above the soil. This method also promotes the growth of new shoots and allows the mint plant to keep growing after harvest. 3. Follow steps 4-7 from Choice 1 to properly care for your mint post-harvest. Both options are effective, with the main difference being cutting stems slightly below the ground in the first choice, and cutting stems above the ground in the second choice. Neither will harm the plant, and both will encourage healthy regrowth. Ultimately, the option you choose depends on your personal gardening preference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: Both sentences describe a scene involving a person and some objects in the background. However, there are significant differences between the elements of each scene. Let's analyze their components: 1. Person: The first sentence describes a young girl, while the second describes a woman. Although both are female, there's a difference in age, making this component dissimilar. 2. Activity / Object Interaction: In the first sentence, the girl is wearing a bike helmet, suggesting she is or will be engaging in a biking activity. In the second sentence, the woman is holding a small dog on a leash, suggesting she is involved in a dog walking activity. This represents a clear difference in actions and objects the person is interacting with. 3. Background Objects: The first sentence has a bicycle in the background, reinforcing the biking theme. The second sentence has chairs in the background, which do not reinforce the dog walking theme nor relate to the bicycle. So, there's no commonality between the two background objects. Considering these differences, the overall similarity score is 1 out of 5, indicating a low level of meaning overlap. The score is not 0 because both sentences describe a scene, share a similar structure, and involve a person; however, the specific details of each scene differ significantly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilization teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerceâs âSave the Senateâ effort is being led by both Republicans who back the partyâs presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, and those who have balked at doing so, in a shared quest to retain the Senate majority. The Chamberâs coalition highlights how much easier it is for Republicans to rally around congressional races this year than to join forces in the divisive presidential election. Republicans âare all over the board on the presidential race, but thereâs a lot of unanimity when it comes to the Senate,â said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), an honorary co-chairman and fundraiser for the Chamberâs push. Mr. Graham, who ended his own presidential campaign in December, hasnât endorsed Mr. Trump. The initiative has no specified fundraising goal. âWeâre going to raise as much as we can to be competitive between now and election day,â said Scott Reed, the Chamberâs senior political strategist. Kristina Peterson reports. SUSAN BENKELMAN: MCCONNELL, RYAN USE BALANCE-OF-POWERS ARGUMENT TO REASSURE VOTERS The GOP leaders are asserting themselves as independent actors who control an equal branch of government. In doing so, they’re taking distance from Donald Trump’s candidacy and telling GOP voters–and independents–that it’s okay to support Republicans for Congress. Read Susan Benkelman’s full post in Washington Wire. WSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS TRUMP HOPES FOR BOOST FROM SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Donald Trump, surveying the next phase of his Republican presidential campaign, is counting on a boost from an untapped well of disenchanted voters who hate the status quo, think the system is stacked against them and canât stand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. That would be some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders. âIâm hearing weâre going to get close to 40% of his supporters,â Mr. Trump said at a recent campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M. âThe system is rigged against Bernie, so he canât winâ in the Democratic presidential primary. âWeâre going to get tremendous numbers from Bernie Sanders.â But making that prediction come true would require an extraordinary amount of persuasion, if recent opinion polls and interviews with Sanders backers are any indication. Janet Hook reports. ECONOMIC SCARS HELP EXPLAIN BIZARRE 2016 RACE: The search for an explanation of this yearâs bizarre political climate leads to a basic conclusion: The recession that started in 2007 and the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 scared and scarred the electorate more deeply and more permanently than has been recognized before. Yes, the economic statistics say thereâs been a recoveryâa relatively nice one at that. But mentally, many Americans have never recovered, and perhaps never will. The experience has altered their attitudes about the political and economic systems and their leaders, and left them willing to consider risky alternatives. What the country is experiencing âis the difference between a car crash and having your house burn down,â says Democratic pollster Peter Hart. âA car crash is something that fades as the three or six months mark goes by. Your house burning down is never forgotten. It is always there and there is no half-life.â Read Washington bureau chief Gerald F. Seibâs full Capital Journal column.

SEIB VIDEO: TWO THINGS TO WATCH IN POLITICS THIS SUMMER As the presidential candidates continue to march toward the general election, WSJ’s Jerry Seib plans to keep an eye on the Bernie Sanders campaign and the battle over control of the Senate. WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB Bernard Avishai of The New Yorker writes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may pay a price for appointing controversial hardliner Avigdor Lieberman his new defense minister, a move that has angered the leaders of the nation’s armed forces: “Netanyahu may keep power for a while, but in losing the Army he has lost a major source of his legitimacy.” Ben Brody of Bloomberg looks at a string of Republican politicians who have come around to Donald Trump’s side: “As the presumptive nominee, Trump, 69, has found increasing support, even among some Republican leaders who had earlier declared themselves completely opposed to his brash bid.” The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein writes thatÂ “the history in both parties is that primary wounds eventually get healed. But with Trump stirring in these early polls, that healing process can’t start too soon to soothe the nerves of anxious Democrats.” Juan Williams writes in the HillÂ thatÂ “one fundamental thing separates Trumpâs fans and critics: Whether they have taken the time to apply even the slightest scrutiny to what he says and does.” FEEDBACK:Â The Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter is The Wall Street Journal’s morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.

She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good.

Sir David Bell, trustee of the bureau behind the Newsnight report that led to the smearing of Lord McAlpine Disturbing questions have been raised about the role of a senior adviser to the Leveson Inquiry.

As Steven began to recite his vows, he fixed his gaze upon Emily, the love of his life, who stood in front of him with tears welling up in her eyes. Her delicate hands were gently held by his own, and amidst the murmurs of excitement and anticipation from the gathered crowd, every word that Steven uttered seemed to reverberate with sincerity and love. With each sentence, the very air around the couple seemed to grow warmer, as if the strength of their bond could be physically felt by those present. Time seemed to freeze as Steven continued to emotionally share his vows, expressing his gratitude to Emily for the countless ways in which she had changed his life and inspired him to grow as a person. He promised to love her unconditionally, through the best and worst of times, and to be a constant source of support and understanding whenever she needed it. As he pledged to cherish her, during times of happiness and sorrow alike, their love and commitment transcended the words spoken, and the couple seemed to be enveloped by an almost palpable aura of togetherness. Their friends and family, who had gathered to celebrate this special day, were not immune to the undeniable emotion and power of the vows exchanged. Handkerchiefs dabbed at still-damp eyes, as loved ones struggled to contain their emotion. Many could not help but reflect upon their own experiences of love and commitment and how the young couple had managed to remind them of that which truly matters in life. Once Steven had finished reciting his vows, Emily responded with her own passionate words, describing the incredible journey she and Steven had shared up to this point, and expressing her dreams and aspirations for their future together.

Mathew goes to the gym 5 times a week and does very intensive workouts. Damen on the other hand does not go to the gym at all and lives a mostly sedentary lifestyle. Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Mathew will have bigger muscles.

Abstract: During meiosis I, kinetochores of sister chromatids are juxtaposed or fused and mono-orient, while homologous chromosomes that are paired by chiasmata (bivalents) have to biorient. In the absence of chiasmata, biorientation of sister chromatids (univalents), which carries a risk of aneuploidy, has been occasionally detected in several species, including humans. We show in fission yeast that biorientation of fused sister kinetochores predominates during early prometaphase I. Without chiasmata, this undesirable biorientation of univalents persists and eventually evades the spindle assembly checkpoint, provoking abnormal anaphase. When univalents are connected by chiasmata or by an artificial tether, this erroneous attachment is converted to monopolar attachment and stabilized. This stabilization is apparently achieved by a chromosome configuration that brings kinetochores to the outer edge of the bivalent, while bringing Aurora B, a destabilizer of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, inward. Our results elucidate how chiasmata favor biorientation of bivalents over that of univalents at meiosis I..

Sentence: \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Options: +unacceptable +acceptable","completion":"+acceptable A linguist would most likely rate this sentence as acceptable linguistically. In order to understand the reasoning behind this assessment, it is essential to examine the sentence based on the key aspects of linguistics, which include syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of a sentence, and in English, this typically involves a clear arrangement of the sentence elements, such as the subject, verb, and object. In the given sentence, \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door,\\" the syntax is correct. The sentence has a clear subject (implied \\"you\\" as the person being addressed), a verb (\\"give\\"), and an object (\\"a fresh coat of paint\\"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase \\"to the front door\\" provides the necessary information about the location in which the action should be performed. Semantics deals with the meaning behind the words and phrases used in a sentence. In this instance, the meaning of the sentence is quite clear. The speaker is directing someone to paint the front door in a new color or fresh finish by providing a new layer of paint. Each word in the sentence contributes to conveying the overall meaning without any ambiguity or unintended interpretations. Pragmatics considers the context in which a sentence is used and how context affects the meaning and acceptability of a sentence. In this case, the given sentence is appropriate for a variety of communication settings. It could serve as an instruction given by a homeowner to a professional painter, a suggestion between neighbors, or even as part of a \\"to-do\\" list for home improvement. The sentence is versatile and context-appropriate, which makes it an acceptable sentence from a pragmatic perspective as well. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door\\" would be deemed linguistically acceptable by a linguist, considering the aspects of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. This sentence demonstrates proper structure and word order, has a clear and coherent meaning, and is well-suited to a range of communication contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand the relationship between the two, let's break down the given statement. It suggests that a key principle in Baptist tradition is that local Baptist Churches operate independently and possess self-governance. In other words, they manage their own affairs without a central authority directing their actions. This notion aligns with the Baptist belief in the autonomy of local churches, allowing each congregation to determine its particular practices and doctrines based on the Bible's teachings. Now, the additional part of the statement argues that referring to Baptists as a denomination might be somewhat inconsistent, given their commitments to local church autonomy. A denomination typically refers to a religious group that shares unified doctrines, practices, and structures. However, because Baptist churches are self-governing and independent, they might not always have uniform practices or perspectives on matters of faith. This diversity makes it less accurate to label them as a single denomination, which implies a more rigid organizational structure. In conclusion, the provided statement contains the answer to the question at hand. The primary Baptist principle asserts that local Baptist Churches are both independent and self-governing, emphasizing autonomy and the freedom of each congregation to define its path guided by the Bible. The term \\"Baptist denomination\\" might not capture this emphasis on local church autonomy as it implies a more unified and centralized organizational structure.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

He led a debate on the crash and its implications for future air displays at Westminster Hall on Tuesday. Eleven people died when a vintage jet crashed in to the A27 in West Sussex. The Conservative MP said although a lot of work went into making air shows as safe as possible, the implications of the crash in Shoreham must be discussed. \\"I think there will have to be some changes.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Options： A. burned B. polished C. carved D. composted E. nailed A:","completion":"B. polished You would be most likely to see your reflection in a piece of wood when it has been polished. Polishing a wooden surface can significantly improve its reflectiveness by smoothing out its rough texture and adding a glossy finish. The polished surface allows light to bounce off more uniformly, allowing you to see a reflection. Here's a more detailed explanation for why the other options are not suitable: A. Burned: Burning a piece of wood creates charred, blackened areas that are not ideal for reflecting light. These darkened areas typically have an uneven surface and have poor reflectivity, making it difficult to see a clear reflection. C. Carved: Carving a wooden surface usually results in intricate shapes and patterns which disrupt the uniformity of the surface, causing light to scatter in different directions. This makes it difficult to see a clear reflection in carved wood. D. Composted: Composting a piece of wood means that it is broken down by microorganisms into smaller components to create nutrient-rich soil. As a result, the wood ceases to exist in solid form, and you'll not be able to see your reflection in any manner. E. Nailed: Nailing a piece of wood refers to securing it with nails, which does not affect the wood's reflective properties directly. The reflective nature of the wood depends on the surface finish, and nails do not contribute to this aspect. In conclusion, the most suitable option for seeing your reflection in a piece of wood is when the wood has been polished. A polished wooden surface possesses a smooth and glossy finish, which allows light to reflect off its surface more uniformly and creates a mirror-like effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The fee for this lifesaving miracle? The aliens want a glass of water.

Tough guy government agent Nick Pirandello (James Belushi) is recruited to escort a meek office worker named Bob Wilson (also played by Ritter) whom FBI computers have found as a lookalike for the deceased Agent Pillbox. However, Wilson is no agent, having been easily pushed around by a group of bullies who lived down the street, and by a milkman who was trying to seduce his wife. Pirandello is unconventional, and likes to do things his way. He meets Wilson at Wilson's home, with Russian agents close on his tail.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No Letup on the Right to Choose Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator, got national attention last week for her marathon filibuster against an extremist package of abortion restrictions. Ms. Davisâs dramatic gesture is unlikely to stop the hard-right Texas Legislature from passing the bill, and there are many similar measures around the country that are part of a nonstop attack on womenâs reproductive rights by Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups. But her uprising, which shot around the country on Twitter and the rest of the social Web, showed that Democrats can fight back against the anti-abortion-rights campaign. It is already showing signs of revitalizing a somnambulant Texas Democratic Party, and it should inspire abortion-rights advocates everywhere. Last Tuesday, talking for more than 11 hours, Ms. Davis actually blocked passage of the new abortion restrictions by essentially running out the clock on a special legislative session. Her victory may prove to be short-lived. Texasâs Republican governor, Rick Perry, has called another special session beginning on Monday to try to resurrect the bill. The measure, a grab bag of constitutionally dubious ideas from other places, would give Texas one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, and that is saying a lot these days. If enacted, it would ban abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization; there would be no rape exception, and a narrow physical health exception would jeopardize womenâs lives by requiring risk to a âmajor bodily functionâ before a woman could terminate a pregnancy. Other provisions would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers, including specifications for parking spaces and janitorsâ closets, and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. These medically unnecessary rules could result in the closing of all but 5 of 42 clinics in the state that now provide abortion services. In other parts of the country, supposedly âsmall-governmentâ Republicans are mandating government interference with a womanâs personal and complex childbearing decisions. Some 40 new abortion restrictions have been enacted so far this year in 13 states, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In New York, legislators defeated a measure proposed by the Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, that essentially would have enshrined the reproductive rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade into state law. In Ohio, an egregious measure tucked into the state budget would bar a public hospital from entering into an agreement to take emergency patients from abortion clinics, which are required under state law to have such an agreement. In Washington, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives voted for a federal 20-week abortion ban, a present to the partyâs right flank that, fortunately, stands to go nowhere in the Democratic-led Senate. Wendy Davisâs filibuster is a reminder of the need for engagement by elected officials and voters to prevent further restrictions that trample on the rights and health of women. With so many damaging restrictions already on the books, though, much also depends on the courts to do their job and insist on respect for existing constitutional protections. That includes the Supreme Court, which has tentatively accepted a case for next term testing the validity of Oklahomaâs effective ban on a safe and common first-trimester abortion method that uses prescription medication. Summary:","completion":"Texas State Senator Wendy Davis gained national attention for her filibuster against a package of abortion restrictions. The measure would give Texas one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, banning abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization with no rape exception. Other provisions could result in the closing of 37 out of 42 clinics providing abortion services in the state. While Davis's filibuster may not stop the bill, it demonstrates that Democrats can challenge such measures and has inspired abortion-rights advocates."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election Wednesday to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus, a familiar role for the underestimated scrapper whose top priority will be to protect President Donald Trump's agenda and try to build the party back to retake the majority. The speaker's gavel long gone, the race for minority leader was McCarthy's to lose, but the Californian's rise was never guaranteed. He's close to Trump, but the president is also friendly with Rep. Jim Jordan, the conservative Freedom Caucus member, and both faced testy colleagues ready to assign blame after the midterm election losses. In the end, McCarthy pushed past Jordan, 159-43, according to officials familiar with the closed-door voting. McCarthy \\"knows what he needs to do,\\" said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won the No. 2 spot as minority whip. \\"You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\\" Scalise said Tuesday.

Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as her party's nominee for speaker. On the other side of the Capitol, senators chose Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer for Democrats in closed-door party elections that lacked the drama of the House contest. Both McConnell and Schumer were chosen as leader by acclamation, according to those familiar with the private caucus meetings. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who expanded GOP ranks in last week's midterm, faced no opponent. Democrats returned Schumer's entire leadership team, despite the failure to capture the majority in the midterms. Senate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men. Ernst called her selection to the leadership ranks \\"a great honor.\\" During a brief photo op in McConnell's Capitol office ahead of voting, McConnell presented his newly elected senators who will take their seats in January. Among them was Florida's Rick Scott, the Republican governor whose race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson remains undecided.

Schumer said Trump is lying about voter fraud in Florida's election and remained confident Nelson would return as Florida's senator, as long as every vote was counted. \\"President Trump and Gov. Scott have just lied,\\" Schumer said. \\"They've said there's fraud when their own Republican officials in Florida have said there's no fraud.\\" Schumer portrayed Senate Democrats as emboldened, despite midterm losses, by an election he characterized as a rejection of the GOP tax cuts and Republican efforts to end the Affordable Care Act. Even in the minority, Schumer said Senate Democrats will push for the party's broader congressional agenda of lowering health care costs, investing in infrastructure and implementing good government reforms to put a check on the Trump administration, which he called \\"the most ethically challenged in history.\\" \\"We will be relentless here in the Senate,\\" said Schumer, flanked by his leadership team. \\"Senate Democrats are committed to fighting to make those ideas a reality in this upcoming Congress.\\" Trump has stayed largely on the sidelines ahead of elections that will determine party leadership. The contest between McCarthy and Jordan reflected the split between the GOP's conservative flank, whose numbers are bolstered after the election, and what remains of the centrists. It will continue to challenge the new leader. Jordan's entire campaign was built on the premise, lawmakers said, that Republicans lost because they didn't \\"do what we said\\" — including on Trump's priorities to build the border wall with Mexico. On Wednesday, Jordan told \\"Fox & Friends\\" the GOP lost its House majority because it didn't deliver on promises to Americans to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fund Trump's wall and replace the Obama health care law. \\"Some key things we told them we were going to do, we didn't,\\" Jordan said. The Ohio Republican, though, was always considered a longshot, and his run was viewed as a way to assert a greater role for the conservatives and the Freedom Caucus at the leadership table. Conservatives have long promoted Jordan for the ranking member position on a top House committee, including the Judiciary panel, where Democrats plan multiple investigations into Trump's businesses and administration. Most GOP lawmakers, though, preferred McCarthy's more affable approach to running the often unruly conference. Rounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wants to bring a more aggressive stance to the GOP's communications and messaging strategy in the No. 3 spot. In the lead-up to Wednesday's election, McCarthy and Jordan encountered frustration, finger-pointing and questions as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat and began considering new leadership for the next congressional session. Republicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting.

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has vowed to help lead Republicans back to the majority in 2020. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Congress McCarthy hits hard at Dems after winning minority leader post The California Republican easily defeated conservative hard-liner Jim Jordan. House Republicans immediately resumed a wartime posture Wednesday after electing their new leadership — vowing to aggressively resist Democrats' agenda and work to recapture the House majority after being routed in last week's elections. In his first news conference after Republicans chose him to be House minority leader next year, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) largely attributed the GOP wipeout to historical trends while also repeatedly blaming spending by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as the cause of several Republican defeats in close contests. Story Continued Below And rather than offer any conciliatory words to Democratic leaders, McCarthy and his newly appointed leadership team said they intend to retake the House in 2020 and push back against a Democratic agenda they described as primarily aimed at unseating President Donald Trump. \\"I know they want to abolish ICE. I know they want to impeach the president,\\" McCarthy said. \\"I just don’t think that’s the agenda Americans want.\\" McCarthy's comments came shortly after his colleagues and incoming GOP freshmen elected him to be the top House Republican in next year's Congress, easily casting aside a challenge for the post from conservative firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

McCarthy got 159 votes to Jordan’s 43 in the members-only session, according to Republican sources in the room. The victory sealed McCarthy's yearslong drive to rise to the top of the House Republican Conference, an effort derailed by Jordan and the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2015. Back then, McCarthy was running for speaker but ran into opposition from the Freedom Caucus and withdrew his name from consideration. That cleared the way for Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to become speaker. Ryan announced in April he would retire from the House; amid intense jockeying behind the scenes to replace him, McCarthy consistently remained the front-runner. House Republicans also filled out the rest of their leadership team for the new Congress with few surprises. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana will be minority whip, and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming — a rising star in the party and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — will be Republican Conference chairwoman. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina will be vice chair and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota will chair the National Republican Campaign Committee. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama will lead the Republican Policy Committee. Palmer is the first member of the Freedom Caucus to capture a leadership role. Following McCarthy's comments, Cheney gave a nod to the GOP's struggles among women and minorities. She insisted that Republicans would \\"take a back seat to no one\\" when it comes to \\"doing what's right for America's women, America's minorities.\\" McCarthy also acknowledged Republicans' struggles in the suburbs. \\"We took a beating inside the suburban areas,\\" he said, adding, \\"Our ideas are going to have to be stronger.\\" McCarthy’s victory is a bittersweet one, coming as Republicans prepare to hand the speaker's gavel back to Democrats for the first time in eight years. Dragged down by history and Trump’s dismal poll numbers, Democrats enjoyed their biggest House victory since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Democrats are on track to gain 35 to 40 seats, including a slew in McCarthy’s home state of California, where an already small number of Republican House members saw their ranks shrink dramatically. McCarthy didn't mention Trump in his remarks after the leadership elections, instead alluding to him only when asked about the reason for GOP losses. He criticized Democrats for what he said seemed to be a plan to impeach the president, though Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has rebuffed the notion. He also sidestepped a question about whether Trump's unpopularity and divisive rhetoric hurt Republicans in the elections — saying only that presidents nearly always see their party lose seats in the midterms. In McCarthy's pitch to the GOP Conference, multiple members said the Californian touted his role in recapturing the House from Democrats back in 2010 — a feat Republicans are now solely focused on repeating. “I think the consensus was, he could unify us. He helped us win back the majority from Nancy Pelosi once, and we believe he can do it again,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters. Multiple GOP veterans left Wednesday’s meeting visibly energized and ready to spar with Democratic leaders. “We know the Democrats’ base is going to be pushing them toward investigations and impeachments ad nauseam, probably Cabinet officials, maybe a Supreme Court justice, certainly a president,” said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a longtime lawmaker who helped lead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. “When they overreach, which I’m sure they will, then I think we should push back and we should push back aggressively,” added Chabot, who is running for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee. McCarthy was nominated for the post by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, (R-Texas); Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Brian Mast (R-Fla.) also spoke in favor. The California Republican will still have to deal with Jordan, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other House conservatives who have made headaches for GOP leaders over the years. POLITICO reported Tuesday night that Trump urged McCarthy to “make everybody happy” in regard to Jordan, who wants to be ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. However, Jordan is not popular with other House Republicans and may not be able to jump over more senior lawmakers for the Judiciary post. In his remarks, McCarthy thanked Jordan for running against him but gave little indication of what he expects Jordan's role to be in the next Congress. Meadows told reporters that he thinks Jordan has earned a look to lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, a role that would make him Trump's most prominent defender in any impeachment probe. Jordan left the vote without speaking to reporters, but Meadows said Jordan was \\"gratified\\" to receive the 43 votes he got. He also said McCarthy would be a \\"good leader\\" and would \\"do his best to bring everybody together.\\" Asked whether Jordan should be elevated to the top GOP slot on the Judiciary Committee, Meadows added, \\"I think Jim’s earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary. But that’s not my call.\\" Other Jordan allies on the House Freedom Caucus signaled that they had made peace with McCarthy’s victory, particularly after one of their own won a spot on the GOP leadership team. “In terms of right now, I think we made the right choice in Kevin,” Palmer told reporters. “When we get the majority back, [Jordan will] chair, and he will be a force to be reckoned with.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Republican Kevin McCarthy has easily won an internal party election to lead the shrunken House GOP caucus.

Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries. contains an answer for the question: What was the first town in England to be given county status?, what is it ?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There are many differences between America and China. The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid people. 4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. And only after passengers have passed the road and got the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient, safe and humanizing. Question: Which of the following is NOT the reason why we can hardly see traffic police in the street in America? Options: A: Traffic police are not very necessary because few cars break traffic rules. B: The traffic is very clear and there are few traffic jams and accidents in the street. C: There are so many cars in the street that the traffic police can't be seen. D: The effective traffic rules play an important part in the road safety. A:","completion":"C: There are so many cars in the street that the traffic police can't be seen."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the Military Service Act in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of Military Service Tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy. Conscription lasted until mid-1919. Due to the political situation in Ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in England, Scotland and Wales.

Article: Pseudomonas usually produce mild symptoms in healthy people with strong immune systems. These infections may be water-borne. There have been reports of: Eye infections in people who use extended-wear contact lenses. To avoid this, change your contact lens solution instead of topping it up. Do not wear your contacts for longer than recommended by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. Ear infections in children after swimming in contaminated water. This can occur if the pool does not have enough chlorine to adequately disinfect it. Skin rashes after using a contaminated hot tub. This rash generally manifests as itchy red bumps or blistered filled with fluid around the hair follicles. It may be worse in areas where your skin was covered by a bathing suit. Signs and symptoms of pseudomonas depend on where the infection occurs. Blood infections are characterized by fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pains, and are extremely serious. Lung infections (pneumonia) include symptoms like chills, fever, a productive cough, difficulty breathing. Skin infections may cause an itchy rash, bleeding ulcers, and/or headache. Ear infections may present with swelling, ear pain, itching inside the ear, discharge from the ear, and difficulty hearing. Eye infections caused by pseudomonas may include the following symptoms: inflammation, pus, swelling, redness, pain in the eye, and impaired vision. The doctor will likely want to look at the rash and may take a sample of the bacteria to send to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. This may be done in two ways: Swabbing the infection on your skin Taking a biopsy. Doing a biopsy is rare. If you are otherwise healthy, treatment may not be necessary. Your immune system may clear the infection itself. However, your doctor may suggest: Anti-itch medications if you have an itchy rash Antibiotics if you have a serious infection.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman.

Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more global warming occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is more conservation, does have a direct and indirect effect on the process of global warming and air pollution. Step-by-step explanation: 1. More conservation implies a reduction in human activities contributing to air pollution, such as the release of carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, and CFCs. 2. Reducing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere will help maintain the balance of the carbon cycle, which could alleviate the effects of global warming. 3. Decreasing methane emissions, particularly from livestock and agriculture, will help lessen the damage to the ozone layer, better protecting us from harmful rays from the sun. 4. Reducing CFC emissions from various sources like spray cans will also minimize the damage to the ozone layer, aiding in the restoration of this crucial protective layer. 5. Lowering sulfur dioxide emissions will decrease the formation of acid rain. The wind will continue to have the potential to blow gasses, but with fewer pollution particles present, the resultant rain will be less acidic. 6. Lessening the occurrences of acid rain will, in turn, protect forests and aquatic life, promoting healthier ecosystems. In conclusion, more conservation practices have both direct and indirect impacts on the process of global warming and air pollution. By minimizing the release of harmful gasses and pollutants, we can mitigate some of the negative effects on our environment, including forest damage, ozone layer depletion, and the decline of aquatic life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Griffin III’s skills offer risks and rewards Griffin practiced during the week after receiving medical clearance to do so, and the team’s coaches said that, barring a recurrence of his concussion symptoms, they expected him to play against the Vikings. The team also spent the week readying rookie backup Kirk Cousins and third-stringer Rex Grossman in case Griffin suffered a setback. But if Griffin indeed starts Sunday, the game will be the first test of how differently Griffin might play and how differently the Redskins might use him. “He’s a smart guy,” Redskins linebacker London Fletcher said. “He understands. He knows his value to this football team and how important it is to have him out there playing.” Former NFL coach Dan Reeves said the burden of safeguarding Griffin falls in large part to the young quarterback himself. “I think he’ll learn as he goes along,” Reeves said in a telephone interview. “He’ll learn how to protect himself. There’s a time to be a competitor. And there’s a time not to take people on. Sometimes you have to watch yourself.” Reeves, who was Michael Vick’s first NFL coach with the Falcons, said a team also must do its part and learn as it goes along when it has a quarterback, like Vick or Griffin, who is a dynamic runner along with being a threat as a passer. “He’s so talented,” Reeves said. “As a coach, you want to use all those things. But you also have to protect him. It’s a learning process. He’s going to get enough chances to run with the ball just off the passing plays that you call, when things break down, even without having a lot of designed runs for him. It’s difficult as a coach when you have a player with so many talents. You want to use them all. But you have to have an attitude where you step back and say, ‘We have to ease up here to keep him healthy.’ It’s a learning process for both.” Reeves said the Redskins have done a good job of crafting an offensive system to get the most out of Griffin’s talents. The Redskins blended elements of tactics associated with the college version of the sport, such as the spread offense and the triple-option running game, with more conventional NFL strategies to assemble an offensive system for Griffin that has befuddled opposing defenses at times. The Redskins are ranked seventh in the league in total offense, based on yards gained, and eighth in scoring. Griffin has thrown the ball efficiently and has run the ball well when needed, with four rushing touchdowns to go with his four touchdown passes in five games. Griffin’s running was being curtailed even before he got hurt. He had a total of 33 rushing attempts in the Redskins’ first three games, including 13 in a loss at home Sept. 23 to the Cincinnati Bengals.

This ravishing, archetypal romance has such vitality and incandescent charm that it all comes together beautifully, without ever degenerating into kitsch. 9. So well made that the horrors of trench warfare have all the impact of a beautifully-dressed, slightly morbid department store window. 10. There's such an excess of plot and detail that characterization is neglected--none of these characters is more than single-dimensional...

Gather materials: Before starting the repair process, gather all the necessary materials, including: - A needle or toothpick - Clear fishing line or nylon thread - A pair of scissors - A pair of gloves (optional, but recommended to avoid cuts) 2. Assess the size and type of tear: Examine the tear to determine the best repair method. If the tear is small (less than 1/2 inch) and straight, you can likely repair it with the sewing method described below. If the tear is larger or irregular, you may need to consider replacing the entire screen or using a screen repair patch. 3. Prepare the fishing line or nylon thread: Using the needle or toothpick, thread a piece of clear fishing line or nylon thread through it, creating a loop that will be used to sew the tear together. Make sure the length of the fishing line or nylon thread is more than enough to cover the length of the tear. 4. Put on gloves (optional): To prevent any potential cuts from the screen's sharp edges, put on a pair of gloves before starting the repair process. 5. Start sewing the tear: Begin sewing along one edge of the tear, working your way from the bottom to the top. Use the needle or toothpick to guide the fishing line or nylon thread through the tiny holes in the screen, pulling the fishing line or nylon thread taut as you go. The goal here is to create a zig-zag pattern that will hold the screen's edges together. 6. Knot the thread: Once you have reached the end of the tear, secure the fishing line or nylon thread with a double or triple knot. Trim off any excess thread with the scissors. 7. Inspect your work: After you have finished sewing the tear, inspect your work to make sure the zig-zag pattern is holding the edges of the tear together tightly. If there are any loose areas, repeat the sewing process until the entire tear is securely sewn. 8. Apply clear adhesive (optional): If you want to further reinforce the repair, you can apply a small amount of clear adhesive, such as super glue or clear nail polish, along the sewn area to help hold the fishing line or nylon thread in place. Allow the adhesive to dry before using the window screen again. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully repair a small tear in a window screen.

Here is an article: Donald Trump has promised repeatedly throughout his campaign to save the U.S. coal industry after years of bankruptcies and dwindling job prospects for coal miners. On Tuesday, he stood before a crowd in Virginia with “Trump Digs Coal” signs and declared that he was the “last shot for the miners.” But experts say Trump’s plan, to the extent that he has has one, is removed from the tough economic reality of coal, which has been forced to compete with the declining price of alternatives like natural gas and renewable energy sources, even as federal regulations push the U.S. away from fossil fuels. And many believe that Trump’s possibly futile focus on saving the coal industry detracts attention from the real proposals needed to help coal workers transition into new jobs in a new industry. “We really want the solar industry to come to the table now and find ways to get more jobs going in some of these communities that need jobs,” says Van Jones, an environmental activist who served as President Obama’s first-term green jobs czar. “If we’re concerned about coal country, and I am, we have to do a lot more than just yell.” U.S. mines produced about 900 million tons of coal last year, a nearly 25% decline since 2008 and the lowest amount of production since 1986, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The change has come as energy companies have built up their natural gas and renewable capacity. The decline in coal production has led the industry to hemorrhage workers, with 50,000 coal-related jobs lost between 2008 and 2012, according to a study from last year. And that’s just the latest in a downward slope in the industry since the 1980s due to mechanization that displaced human labor. The coal mining industry directly employed more than 140,000 in 1989 and and only 85,000 a decade later, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Experts agree that reversing that trend would be next to impossible without huge subsidies for the industry, as it is changing market factors—more than government policy—that has driven the decline in coal production. The development of fracking has expanded dramatically the availability of natural gas, making the largely cleaner fuel source cheaper than coal in most cases. And, in recent years, renewable energy sources like wind and solar have become cost-competitive with coal in many places. But Trump and many Republicans place the blame for the loss of coal jobs on President Obama’s “war on coal.” Indeed, Trump’s plan to revive coal mostly revolves around removing existing regulations. “We’re going to save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda,” he said at during an energy policy speech in May. “Any regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped.” Trump’s campaign did not return a request for comment Friday. Undoubtedly, regulations from his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have contributed to reduced demand for coal. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, sets standards that will require many states to phase out coal-fired power plants if implemented. But the regulations merely expedite a trend already in progress. There is hope for coal workers losing their job—or at least there could be. The number of jobs in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, has skyrocketed even as the number of coal jobs has dwindled. The solar industry alone employs more than 200,000 people and has been growing at a rate of 20% annually, according to a report from the Solar Foundation. Another 80,000 were employed in the wind industry with similar levels of growth, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association. A new study published in the journal Energy Economics found that most coal employees could be retrained for similar jobs in the solar industry with relatively little investment. Researchers behind the study, which relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared a job in the coal industry with it closest equivalent in the solar industry. The solar industry could easily absorb the expected job losses and many employees might even see a salary increase, according to the research. “There are not that many more jobs coming in the coal mines, period. There aren’t that many jobs coming on oil rigs, period,” says Jones. “At some point we have to accept the fact that the clean energy companies are growing faster than everything else.” Many politicians and policymakers have proposed programs to help coal workers transition into these jobs. President Obama’s recent budget requests have included billions of dollars for a variety of programs to aid communities hurt by the declining coal industry, including job transition initiatives. Some of those programs have received funding from Congress, like the POWER program that provides economic development grants to affected areas. Other proposals for coal communities have gone unfunded. Despite a gaffe where Hillary Clinton said she would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” Clinton herself has a fairly expansive plan to aid hurting coal communities with a price tag of 30 billion. That includes providing health care benefits to former miners, investing in job education and repurposing old coal infrastructure for clean tech. Clinton’s plans may not be perfect. A West Virginia Coal Association executive described it as an insufficient “care package.” But the reality is that America is already moving past coal, for environmental and economic reasons. If Trump “digs coal” and the people who actually dig it, he’ll need to figure out a way to make sure those workers aren’t left behind.

Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - Chambers Motors was the first automobile manufacturer in Ireland . The company built vehicles by hand featuring high - quality components designed and fabricated in - house . Passenger cars were made to suit doctors and wealthy businessmen , and commercial vehicles were produced for duty as delivery vans , ambulances , and hearses . A key feature of the vehicles was a unique design of epicyclic gearbox in the rear axle . Chambers Motors employed around 75 people and built approximately 500 vehicles in 25 years of operation . - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Controversy persists over whether the Rus’ were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \\"Normanist\\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.

Write a question about the following article: When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for Švitrigaila, who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites. The final Battle of Pabaiskas was fought in September 1435 near Ukmergė , northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides. Švitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian-Polish army, led by Michael Žygimantaitis, and soundly defeated. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410. On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422.

This article: The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Washington (CNN) -- State visits to the White House are full of show and symbolism, and Tuesday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is no exception.

Options: a ) 20 , b ) 21 , c ) 22 , d ) 23 , e ) 24","completion":"Let \\"x\\" be the average age of the whole team. Therefore, the total age of the team would be 11x (since there are 11 members in the team). Given that the captain is 27 years and the wicketkeeper is 1 year older (28 years), the combined age of the captain and wicketkeeper is 27 + 28 = 55 years. If we exclude the ages of captain and wicketkeeper, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team, i.e., (x - 1). There are 9 remaining players, so the total age of the remaining players would be 9(x - 1). Now, we can set up the equation: 11x - 55 = 9(x - 1) Now, let's solve the equation. 11x - 55 = 9x - 9 2x = 46 x = 23 So the average age of the whole team is 23 years, which corresponds to option (d)."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Are the following two questions the same? Can Shia and Sunni Muslims be compared to Catholic and Lutheran Christians? Is the Sunni/Shia split in Islam comparable in any way to the Protestant/Catholic split in Christianity?","completion":"Yes, the two questions are essentially asking the same thing: whether the Sunni/Shia split in Islam can be compared to the Catholic/Protestant (specifically Catholic and Lutheran) split in Christianity. While both comparisons concern major schisms in two of the world's largest faiths, there are important differences and similarities between the two divisions. Sunni/Shia Split in Islam: The Sunni/Shia split in Islam began after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE. Following his death, a disagreement arose over the rightful successor to lead the Muslim community. The majority (now Sunni Muslims) supported the election of Abu Bakr, the Prophet's close companion, as the first caliph, while a minority (now Shia Muslims) felt that Ali, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, was divinely appointed to succeed him. This disagreement never fully resolved, leading to a permanent division in the Muslim world. Over the centuries, religious, political, and cultural differences emerged between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Sunnis recognize and adhere to the first four caliphs, while Shias only acknowledge Ali and his descendants as rightful leaders. Theologically, Sunni and Shia Muslims follow different interpretations of Islamic teachings and texts, like the role of the imamate and the authority of religious leaders. Despite these differences, they share many similarities, such as the core tenets of faith, the Five Pillars of Islam, and the holy book, the Quran. Catholic/Protestant (Catholic/Lutheran) Split in Christianity: The Catholic/Protestant divide in Christianity began during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. This movement was sparked by grievances with the Catholic Church, which was seen as corrupt and politically influential. Martin Luther, a German theologian, nailed his \\"95 Theses\\" to the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg in 1517, critiquing various practices, including the sale of indulgences. His challenges to the authority of the Pope and the Church led to a broader reformation, spearheaded by other reformers like John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Catholicism and Protestantism, including Lutheranism, differ significantly on matters of theology, liturgy, and ecclesiastical structure. Some key differences include the role of Scripture, the concept of salvation, the importance of sacraments, and the structure of church governance. However, both denominations share core Christian beliefs, acknowledging Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the significance of the Bible as a sacred text. Comparing the Sunni/Shia and Catholic/Protestant Splits: The Sunni/Shia split in Islam and the Catholic/Protestant split in Christianity share some general similarities in terms of creating long-lasting divisions within the respective religions: 1. Both schisms were rooted in disputes over religious leadership and authority. 2. The divisions have cemented over time, leading to differences in theology, worship, and religious practices. 3. Each schism has had significant political and social implications, sometimes resulting in violence and wars. However, the historical, cultural, and doctrinal contexts of these schisms differ in the following ways: 1. The origins of the Sunni/Shia split date back to the seventh century, while the Catholic/Protestant split occurred in the 16th century. 2. The disputes leading to the Islamic split occurred shortly after the founding of Islam and were more closely connected to the Prophet's immediate successors. In contrast, the Protestant Reformation emerged as a reaction to long-standing practices and corruption within the Catholic Church. 3. The Sunni/Shia divide has a stronger emphasis on succession and the role of religious leaders in the Islamic tradition, whereas the Catholic/Protestant split focuses more on the relationship between Scripture, Church authority, and individual believers. In conclusion, although both questions are asking if the Sunni/Shia split in Islam can be compared to the Catholic/Protestant (Catholic and Lutheran) split in Christianity, it is essential to recognize the distinct historical contexts and differences in theology, ritual, and governance. While there are some broad similarities between the two schisms, understanding and respecting the uniqueness of each religious tradition is crucial for fostering interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. Paragraph: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment.

Introduction A reliable source close to entrepreneur, Sandy Easdale, who is known for his shareholding with the Rangers International Football Club (RIFC) until recently, has exclusively informed BBC Scotland that Rafat Rizvi has been actively introducing potential investors to the Rangers Football Club. This development could signify a potential expansion of financial horizons and investment for the historic Scottish club. In this article, we will delve into the implications of this news, the roles of Sandy Easdale and Rafat Rizvi, and the possible future directions for Rangers in terms of investment and sponsorship. Background on Sandy Easdale and Rafat Rizvi Sandy Easdale is a renowned Scottish businessman with a history of holding shares in multiple businesses across various sectors. He was one of the most significant shareholders in the Rangers International Football Club, having held non-executive roles in the past. Rafat Rizvi, on the other hand, is a British businessman known for his extensive network of contacts and expertise in the business world. Rizvi was rumored to have been instrumental in a 2014 deal assisting the financially struggling Rangers to secure new funding by attracting international investors, which was reported to have advanced the club's prospects significantly. Connecting the Dots: Rizvi's Involvement with Rangers Investors The news that Rafat Rizvi is introducing potential investors to Rangers should not come as a surprise, considering his past involvement with the club and his reputation for connecting businesses with suitable investors. His connections within the football world and beyond could provide the Glasgow-based club with ample opportunities for expansion and growth. Since Rangers have struggled financially over the years – from administration to their freefall through Scotland's football divisions – the introduction of new investors could potentially rejuvenate the club's financial health and facilitate improved on-field performances, satisfying both fans and stakeholders. It could also offer Rangers the means to sign new players, invest in infrastructure, and bolster their marketing and merchandising efforts. The Potential Investors and What They Could Bring to the Table While the identities of the investors Rizvi might be introducing to Rangers have not been disclosed, it is believed that they could belong to a mix of UK-based and international parties. These investors could bring in a myriad of benefits for the club, such as: 1. A fresh infusion of capital – New investors would likely inject a significant amount of money into the club, which could alleviate existing debt and create a stronger financial base, leading to better performances both on and off the field. 2. Expertise and experience – As seasoned investors or entrepreneurs, they might bring valuable experience in business and football to the club. This could potentially improve Rangers' overall decision-making and long-term strategic planning. 3. Global outreach – A diverse pool of investors could expand Rangers' international presence and recognition, potentially opening up new revenue streams through global sponsorship deals and partnerships. The Road Ahead for Rangers With Rafat Rizvi's involvement and the potential influx of new investors, the future outlook for Rangers appears promising. While the club's path has encountered numerous obstacles in the past, the financial groundwork laid by these new investments could send the Rangers on an upward trajectory. However, it's crucial that the club uses the resources wisely and puts efficient strategies in place to ensure that these investments result in long-lasting, positive change for the team and its supporters. Conclusion The news of Rafat Rizvi introducing potential investors to Rangers could mark a turning point for the club as it navigates its way through both financial and competitive challenges. If the club capitalizes on this opportunity and leverages the resources brought in by these investors strategically, Rangers could enjoy a renaissance – both on a financial level and as a competitive force in Scottish football. As fans and supporters eagerly await further news, the developments sparked by these introductions will undoubtedly be watched with keen interest."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"In the 1994 original Disney animated film \\"The Lion King,\\" the character Scar was brought to life with an unforgettable vocal performance. The talented actor who lent his voice to Scar was the renowned British actor Jeremy Irons. Jeremy Irons not only spoke for Scar, but he also sang the villain's most iconic song \\"Be Prepared,\\" which is the third song in the film. \\"Be Prepared\\" sets the stage for Scar's nefarious plan to overthrow his brother Mufasa and claim the throne as the king of Pride Rock. The song was written by Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics), who are both legendary artists in the world of music and theater. In \\"Be Prepared,\\" Scar manipulates a group of cunning hyenas - Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed - to rally behind him and support his evil schemes to seize power in the Pride Lands. The song is often praised for its captivating melody and powerful lyrics, which convey the ruthlessness and cunning of Scar as he readies his forces for the ultimate act of betrayal. Jeremy Irons, with his distinctive and dark voice, perfectly embodied the sinister persona of Scar. This portrayal, combined with fantastic animation and the stirring music, turned Scar into one of the most memorable and scorned villains in the Disney universe. It's important to note that due to vocal strain after singing most of \\"Be Prepared,\\" Jeremy Irons was unable to complete the sequence, and his voice was blended with that of American voice actor, singer, and vocal coach Jim Cummings, best known for voicing Winnie the Pooh and Tigger. Cummings has a strong background in voice acting and singing and blended seamlessly with Irons' voice to maintain the musical continuity in the song.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was happening in France in about 2000 BC?\\" is \\"Marseilles was settled\\"? Select from: (I). no (II). yes","completion":"(I). no The correct answer is \\"no\\" because Marseilles was not settled in about 2000 BC. According to the paragraph, Celtic tribes from eastern Europe came to the areas now known as Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Burgundy around 2000 BC.

If less pollution enters the environment, there will be a reduced amount of pollutants flowing into natural water sources such as rivers and lakes. 2. With fewer pollutants entering the water, the overall water quality will improve. 3. As the water quality improves, the negative impacts on the health of plants and animals living in the water will decrease. 4. With less pollution impacting their health, plants and animals will have a better chance of living longer, healthier lives. 5. Healthier plants and animals have a higher likelihood of reproducing successfully. 6. The increase in successful reproduction will eventually lead to a higher number of plants and animals in the water. 7.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which company made less fuel for trucks? Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less. Hint: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. Answer:","completion":"Company H made less fuel for trucks.

Given the question: Information: - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - \`\` When the People Fell '' is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith , set in his \`\` Instrumentality '' universe . It was originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in April , 1959 , and is most recently collected in The Rediscovery of Man , and in the collection of which it is the title story . The story takes place relatively early in the Instrumentality timeline , and a \`\` scanner Vomact '' appears both in this story and the classic story \`\` Scanners Live in Vain '' . The story recounts , in \`\` flashback '' form -- an interview between a reporter and a crusty old - timer -- a risky attempt by a future Chinese government to claim and settle the planet Venus , at a time when China is the only ethnic nation on Earth which has survived as a separate entity through a global nuclear war and a long dark age which followed . The story implicitly compares Western and Chinese approaches to solving an impossible problem and has the Chinese solution succeed , but at a cost Westerners would find repugnant . - In the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, the Instrumentality of Mankind refers both to Smith's personal future history and universe and to the central government of humanity. \\"The Instrumentality of Mankind\\" is also the title of a paperback collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith published in 1979 (now superseded by the later \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\", which collects all of Smith's short stories). - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet. - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914 February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology. - NESFA Press is the publishing arm of the New England Science Fiction Association, Inc. The NESFA Press primarily produces three types of books: - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith (ISBN 0-915368-56-0) is a 1993 book containing the complete collected short fiction of science fiction author Cordwainer Smith. It was edited by James A. Mann and published by NESFA Press. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - Cordwainer Smith was the pen-name used by American author Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (July 11, 1913 August 6, 1966) for his science fiction works. Linebarger was a noted East Asia scholar and expert in psychological warfare. (\\"Cordwainer\\" is an archaic word for \\"a worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker\\", and a \\"smith\\" is \\"one who works in iron or other metals; esp. a blacksmith or farrier\\": two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.) Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms \\"Carmichael Smith\\" (for his political thriller \\"Atomsk\\"), \\"Anthony Bearden\\" (for his poetry) and \\"Felix C. Forrest\\" (for the novels \\"Ria\\" and \\"Carola\\"). He died of a heart attack in 1966 at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 53. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - \\"Scanners Live in Vain\\" is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Linebarger), set in his Instrumentality of Mankind future history. It was originally published in the magazine \\"Fantasy Book\\" in 1950. It was judged by the Science Fiction Writers of America to be one of the finest short stories prior to 1965 and was included in the anthology \\"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964\\". A revised text, based on Linebarger's original manuscript, appears in the 1993 NESFA Press collection \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" (where it is accompanied by a facsimile of his original cover letter) and the 2007 collection \\"When the People Fell\\". The story was nominated for a Retro Hugo award in 2001. It has been published in Hebrew, Italian, French, German and Dutch translations. - The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964 is a 1970 anthology of science fiction short stories, edited by Robert Silverberg. It is generally considered one of the best of the many science fiction anthologies. Author Lester del Rey said that \\"it even lives up to its subtitle\\", referring to the volume's boast of containing \\"The Greatest Science-Fiction Stories of All Time\\". - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. - A future history is a postulated history of the future and is used by authors in the subgenre of speculative fiction (or science fiction) to construct a common background for fiction.

Article: Elderly women who eat foods higher in potassium are less likely to have strokes and die than women who eat less potassium-rich foods, according to new research in the American Heart Association. \\"Previous studies have shown that potassium consumption may lower blood pressure. But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods. You won't find high potassium in junk food. Some foods rich in potassium include white and sweet potatoes, bananas and white beans.\\" The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that women eat at least 4,700 mg of potassium daily. \\"Only 2.8 percent of women in our study met or went beyond this level. The World Health Organization's daily potassium recommendation for women is lower, at 3,510... Question: The benefits of potassium intake to elderly women do not include _ .

Q: In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question. Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Passage: In 1923, during the American Museum of Natural History expedition by Roy Chapman Andrews to Inner Mongolia, Peter Kaisen discovered numerous theropod remains in three quarries. These were named and shortly described by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1933 as a new species of Ornithomimus: Ornithomimus asiaticus. The specific name refers to the Asian provenance. The species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus by Dale Russell in 1972, making Archaeornithomimus asiaticus the type species of the genus. The generic name combines that of Ornithomimus with a Greek ἀρχαῖος (archaios), \\"ancient\\", because Russell mistakenly believed that the layers Archaeornithomimus was found in dated to the Cenomanian-Turonian, about 95 million years old, making it one of the oldest ornithomimids known at the time. Gilmore had not assigned a holotype specimen; in 1990 David Smith and Peter Galton in the first comprehensive description of the fossils, choose specimen AMNH 6565, a foot, as the lectotype. Link Information: Alan Russell (born 27 December 1937) Question: What age was Dale Russell when the species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus? A:","completion":"Part #1: Determine the time frame when the species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus.

Options: - park - reduce - descend - fall - set A:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the above question is \\"descend.\\" As the counterweight began to rise, the elevator began to descend into the mine. In an elevator system, a counterweight is used to balance the weight of the elevator car and the passengers or cargo inside it. This balance ensures that the overall system operates efficiently and safely. When the elevator is called to move, the electric motor inside the machine starts to reel in the steel cables, which in turn moves the car up or down on the guide rails. As the counterweight rises, it works against the force of gravity to provide balance and support to the elevator car. This action ensures that the motor does not have to work as hard to lift or lower the car, thereby conserving energy and ensuring that the system moves smoothly. As the counterweight moves upward, it pulls the elevator car in the opposite direction, causing it to descend into the mine. In a mining environment, elevators play a critical role in the transport of workers, machinery, equipment, and materials to and from the various levels of the mine. The descent of the elevator into the mine enables safe and efficient access to the working areas, helping to support the productivity and safety of the overall mining operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs.","completion":"The missing first step of this process is the \\"emission of solar radiation by the Sun.\\" Below is a detailed explanation of the whole process: 1. Emission of Solar Radiation by the Sun: The process of global warming starts with the Sun. Our star's energy is generated by nuclear fusion in its core, where extremely high pressure and temperature combine hydrogen atoms to create helium, releasing light and heat in the process. This energy is radiated into space in all directions as electromagnetic waves, known as solar radiation. Some of these waves, particularly those in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, travel across space to the Earth, with a tiny fraction of the Sun's total radiation reaching our planet. 2. The Radiation is Absorbed by the Earth: When the solar rays reach Earth, they interact with Earth's atmosphere and surface. Roughly a third of this radiation is reflected back into space by clouds, atmospheric particles, and bright surfaces like ice and snow. The rest passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the land, oceans, and vegetation on Earth's surface. This absorbed solar energy warms the Earth and is transformed into heat. 3. Some of the Radiation Goes Back into Space: Earth, being warm, also radiates energy back out to space, but in the form of infrared or heat energy. However, before this heat energy can escape to space, certain atmospheric gases known as greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) can absorb it. 4. Some is Trapped by the Atmosphere: Once the radiation is absorbed by these greenhouse gases, they re-emit the heat in all directions. Some of this heat is sent back towards Earth's surface, causing a warming effect. This natural process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is crucial for life as it keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life. 5. If Too Much Heat is Trapped: While the greenhouse effect is natural and necessary, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have added large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This enhancement elevates the natural greenhouse effect, causing more heat to be trapped than necessary, leading to an overall warming of the Earth. 6. Global Warming Occurs: The accumulated effect of these actions is global warming, an increase in Earth's average temperature. The enhanced greenhouse effect is causing Earth's average temperature to rise, disrupting climate patterns and ecosystems worldwide. This can lead to severe consequences, including sea-level rise, more frequent extreme weather events, and mass extinction of certain species. Thus, understanding this process is essential to identifying ways we can reduce our impact and mitigate climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hale’s magnetic, mesmerizing ‘Self-Portrait’ There’s blood in that pale, sinewy hand. Blood and resolve. Idle for now, it won’t stay that way for long. It’s poised for action. The hand belonged to Ellen Day Hale, who painted it herself in 1885. It’s part of a self-portrait, one of the best in the Museum of Fine Arts, where it hangs in the Art of the Americas Wing, in a gallery devoted to the so-called Boston School. Like all the other works in this gem of a gallery, the work is pleasing to look at. It’s easy to appreciate the loosely brushed blue background with its scattering of parti-colored blossoms; the big round ostrich feather fan in the foreground; the rich array of blacks. But before you can register this — before “taste” and “design” have a chance to announce themselves — what arrests your attention is all psychological. Hale appraises us with intelligent, unforgiving eyes that won’t let us go. She is not interested in foolishness or play acting. Both her tilted head, so dramatically and brilliantly rendered, and its off-center position enhance the portrait’s immediacy. Like Edgar Degas’s breakthrough 1865 portrait, “Woman Seated Beside a Vase of Flowers,” which shows a woman simultaneously sidelined and made more vivid by a huge bunch of flowers, it increases the sense we have that this is a real woman occupying space in real time — as opposed to “portrait time,” which is imaginary. Hale gives us no choice. You glance in the painting’s direction, and almost hear the whoosh and click, like a magnet hoovering up metal. Hale had just returned from Paris when she painted it. She was born in Worcester into a distinguished Boston Brahmin family (her great aunt was Harriet Beecher Stowe) on Feb. 11, 1855. She died on the same day 85 years later. Her brother was the artist and critic Philip Leslie Hale, who married the wonderful painter Lilian Westcott Hale. She was around artists, writers, educators, and women’s suffragists a lot. She studied art with William Rimmer, and then with William Morris Hunt and his co-teacher, Helen Knowlton, who had a special impact, before furthering her studies in Philadelphia and Paris. She never married, but in 1883 she met fellow artist Gabrielle DeVeaux Clements, with whom she later settled down in a house called “The Thickets” in Gloucester. What, I still wonder, is the look she is giving me, as I stand before this self-portrait? I could throw words at it: disdainful, intolerant of fools, appraising, anxiously tender. But none will stick; all seem less than half-true. In any case, she is not looking at me. She is looking at herself. What she saw there probably surprised and engaged her as much as it does me.

However, it does mention that there were multiple slave uprisings during this period. For a more detailed and long answer to this question, we can explore some of the significant uprisings and civil wars that took place in Rome during the 1st century BC. 1. The Spartacus Revolt (73-71 BC): This was a significant slave uprising led by the gladiator Spartacus. Thousands of slaves joined forces with him to fight against the Roman Republic. Eventually, the rebels were defeated by Roman generals Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey the Great. 2. The Sertorian War (80-72 BC): This civil war took place in the Roman province of Hispania. It was led by Quintus Sertorius, a Roman statesman and general, who revolted against the centralized power of the Roman Republic and sought to create an independent state in Hispania. He was eventually defeated by Pompey the Great. 3. The Catilinarian Conspiracy (63 BC): This was a political conspiracy led by the Roman senator Lucius Sergius Catilina. He aimed to overthrow the Roman Republic and the consulship of Cicero and Antonius Hybrida. The conspiracy was discovered and thwarted by the famous Roman orator and statesman Cicero. 4. The First Triumvirate (60-53 BC): Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus formed a political alliance to control the Roman Republic. This alliance led to several power struggles and eventually contributed to Caesar's rise in power. 5. Caesar's Civil War (49-45 BC): Caesar's growing power and influence threatened the Roman Senate, leading to a civil war between supporters of Caesar and those of Pompey the Great. Caesar emerged victorious, leading to the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. 6. The Perusine War (41-40 BC): This was a civil war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus) over the control of the city of Perusia (present-day Perugia, Italy). The city eventually surrendered to Octavian, and the war ended with Antony and Octavian reconciling. 7. The Final War of the Roman Republic (32-30 BC): This was a war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian, who had grown tired of sharing power. Octavian defeated Antony and his Egyptian ally, Cleopatra, in the Battle of Actium. Following their defeat, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, and Octavian became the sole ruler of Rome, ushering in the Roman Empire and taking the title Augustus. These are only a few examples of rebellious uprisings and civil wars that took place in Rome during the 1st century BC.

Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? The dog that the rat bit chased the cat. Choices: + unacceptable + acceptable","completion":"First, we should understand what is meant by a sentence being syntactically and semantically acceptable: - Syntax refers to the rules in a language that determine how words and phrases should be arranged in a sentence to make it meaningful. If a sentence is syntactically correct, it will follow these rules. - Semantics refers to the meaning that is conveyed by a text. If a sentence is semantically correct, it will be meaningful. Step 1: Evaluating the syntax: \\"The dog that the rat bit chased the cat.\\" Here, \\"the dog\\" is the subject, \\"chased\\" is the verb, and \\"the cat\\" is the object. Between the subject and verb is an embedded relative clause \\"that the rat bit\\", where \\"that\\" is a relative pronoun, \\"the rat\\" is the subject and \\"bit\\" is the verb. The relative clause adds extra information about the dog. The construction of the sentence, including placement of subject, verb and use of relative clause, is correct according to English syntax rules.

Desperate to end the chaos, the residents turn to the local amateur detective, Charles, who is known for his brilliant mind and uncanny ability to crack even the most difficult cases. However, this case feels different - it appears that the criminals always seem to be one step ahead. As Charles digs deeper into the case, he begins to unveil the secrets and dark history of Redhaven that put his own life in danger. Act 1: The film opens with the discovery of the latest crime scene - a brutal murder of a local store owner. Local law enforcement is baffled, and essentially all leads appear to be dead ends. The small community grows restless, prompting the local sheriff to reluctantly ask for Charles' help. Charles begins his investigation and discovers the first clue - a mysterious symbol etched into the wall at the crime scene. As he continues to investigate, more crimes emerge, each bearing the same cryptic symbol. Charles becomes increasingly entangled in the twisted web of the case. Act 2: As the case progresses, the frequency and severity of the crimes increase. Tension grows within the town as people begin to distrust one another. At the same time, Charles starts to uncover the dark history of Redhaven - including a dangerous criminal organization that once ruled the town in fear. However, after a police raid 15 years ago, the organization was thought to have been dismantled. Charles soon realizes that the symbol is the organization's long-forgotten emblem, signaling their reemergence. He suspects that someone from the town’s past is orchestrating the crimes in order to reestablish the organization's dominance. The revelation is met with disbelief and denial by the community, as the memory of the organization's control still haunts them. Act 3: As Charles gathers evidence, he identifies the mastermind behind the organized crime resurgence - Thomas, a highly influential and respected city official who is hell-bent on asserting control over the town once again. Charles confronts Thomas, who reveals that the town’s corruption runs much deeper than he initially thought. Thomas tells Charles he was once a member of the disbanded criminal organization but secretly continued recruiting people and orchestrating crimes under the radar for years. However, his pride doesn't allow him to fully confess his crimes, as he genuinely believes controlling the town is for the greater good. Charles collects enough evidence to reveal Thomas' involvement but gets captured by his associates, who take him to a remote location in a bid to silence him. A tense standoff ensues as Charles manages to escape, with Thomas and his associates close behind him. Climax: Ultimately, Charles is cornered in an old factory, where he and Thomas have a final confrontation. Thomas admits that his thirst for power has consumed him and that his actions have gone too far. Charles uses his wit and intelligence to outsmart Thomas, who eventually drops his guard. As Thomas prepares to finish off Charles, a swarm of police cars led by the local sheriff converge on the location. The film ends with Thomas' arrest and the dismantling of the criminal network. Resolution: With Thomas in police custody and the imminent dismantling of the criminal organization, Redhaven finally finds peace. Charles is hailed as a hero and acknowledged by the police for his involvement in solving the case. However, in light of the town's dark past, Charles decides to continue his investigations, signaling that the quest for truth and justice is never-ending."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Firstly, the title of the review \\"Too Big!\\" highlights the main issue the reviewer has with the product. The use of an exclamation point emphasizes the dissatisfaction and urgency of the problem. It immediately sets the stage for the reader to expect a negative review. In the body of the review, the user specifically mentions that the product \\"runs huge\\" and compares it to a different size, 2XL, which indicates that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of sizing. The statement \\"I will never be able to wear it for any kind of support\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's discontent and disappointment with the product.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.

Therefore, the answer to the multi-choice problem is: *no; Now, let us address each question individually: 1. What do the English think of Americans? It is important to recognize that opinions and attitudes can vary greatly among individuals within any given group. However, there are some general themes or stereotypes that can be identified when it comes to how the English perceive Americans. Typically, the English may view Americans as friendly and outgoing, but there can also be perceptions of Americans being a bit loud or overly patriotic. Some English people might admire the United States' optimism, entrepreneurial spirit, and the opportunities the country offers. On the other hand, the English might be critical of certain American policies, such as gun ownership, healthcare, or the political landscape. They may also find aspects of American culture, like consumerism or different accents, to be somewhat peculiar. 2. What do Americans think of the English? Again, opinions can differ significantly between individuals; however, some general themes or stereotypes can be noted in how Americans perceive the English. The English are often viewed by Americans as polite, reserved, and well-mannered. Americans might admire certain aspects of English culture, such as their rich history, tradition, and the Royal Family. Additionally, many Americans enjoy British television shows, music, and literature. On the other hand, some Americans might perceive the English as being a bit snobbish or overly formal, associating their accents with intelligence, sophistication, or poshness. It's not uncommon for Americans to find certain British customs, colloquialisms, or their sense of humor to be somewhat baffling. In conclusion, while these questions inquire about related topics, they are not asking for the same information.

These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something.

The second U.S. Ebola victim is back on American soil after her plane landed at Bangor International Airport in Maine early on Tuesday. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. Mrs Writebol, from North Carolina, left Monrovia airport in West Africa early on Tuesday on a chartered plane. She will be treated at Emory University Hospital along with fellow missionary and doctor Dr Kent Brantly in a special quarantine wing. Scroll down for video. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. Back in the States: Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, is due to arrive in Atlanta today to be treated at Emory University Hospital alongside Dr Kent Brantly. Mrs Writebol's son, Jeremy, said his mother 'is still struggling' but that 'there seems to be improvement'. The two Americans infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans. The aid worker is reportedly in a stable condition after receiving a second dose of the drug. Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Mrs Writebol has shown some improvement. over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian. potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. Care: Writebol will join fellow infected aid worker Dr Kent Bradley (pictured) at Emory University Hospital for treatment. However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90 per cent of patients. Jeremy Writebol believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus. The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.' Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol contracted. Ebola after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of. the virus around Monrovia, Liberia. More than 1,300 people have been. stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra. Leone. Quarantine: This is the specially-designed tent that was set up to quarantine the Ebola patients while they fly home aboard the GulfStream air ambulance. The specially-designed air ambulance, seen here taking off from Dobbin Air Reserve Base in Georgia, picked up Mrs Writebol in Liberia. Ebola has no vaccine or antidote. However, both Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were given an experimental treatment last week, according to international relief group Samaritan's Purse. The group originally said that only Writebol got the treatment. Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, according to the organization. Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers. Mrs Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Missionaries: Nancy and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the hospital where Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties. A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen. Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus. David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans. Recovering: Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital, after receiving a dose of an experimental serum. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've been criticized for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital. But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again on Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States. Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region. But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be. 'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies. 'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said. 'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.' Quarantine facilities around the U.S: A widespread Ebola outbreak in the country is 'not in the cards', the CDC director said. That is partly down to the number of quarantine facilities, where the CDC can legally detain anyone who might have been exposed to a number of diseases. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Born on February 8, 1931, in Marion, Indiana, USA, James Byron Dean quickly rose to fame and became a symbol of the struggle and angst experienced by young people during the post-World War II era. The three films that made James Dean famous are \\"East of Eden,\\" \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" and \\"Giant.\\" These films showcased Dean's incredible talent and screen presence, highlighting his ability to embody the complexity of his characters and bring out their emotional vulnerability. 1. \\"East of Eden\\" (1955): Directed by Elia Kazan and based on John Steinbeck's novel of the same name, \\"East of Eden\\" tells the story of two estranged brothers, Cal (played by James Dean) and Aron (played by Richard Davalos), who compete for their father's affection. Dean's portrayal of the tormented and rebellious Cal Trask earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, the first posthumous nomination in that category. The film showcased Dean's natural ability to play complex characters who challenge societal norms. 2. \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" (1955): Directed by Nicholas Ray, this drama revolves around the life of a troubled teenager named Jim Stark (played by James Dean). The story portrays the struggle of Jim as he tries to fit into a new town while grappling with the emotional turmoil caused by his dysfunctional family. Dean's performance in \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" resonated with American teenagers who felt alienated from their parents and the broader society. Dean received his second posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role in this film. 3. \\"Giant\\" (1956): Directed by George Stevens, \\"Giant\\" is a sweeping epic drama based on the novel by Edna Ferber. This movie chronicles the tumultuous lives of a Texas cattle rancher, his family, and the people around them, including Jett Rink (played by James Dean). Dean's performance showcased his ability to play a much older character and deal with the complex emotions associated with greed and ambition. Although Dean did not receive an Academy Award nomination for his role in \\"Giant,\\" the film itself was an immense critical and commercial success. These three films helped solidify James Dean's status as a cultural icon and timeless symbol of teenage disillusionment and rebellion. Unfortunately, Dean's skyrocketing career was cut short when he died in a car accident on September 30, 1956. Dean was driving his Porsche 550 Spyder, nicknamed \\"Little Bastard,\\" when he collided with another vehicle at the junction of California State Route 46 and 41. He was only 24 years old at the time of his tragic death, which added to his enigmatic and enduring legacy. James Dean's brief yet impactful career has left an indelible mark on the film industry and pop culture, with many actors and filmmakers citing him as a significant influence. Even today, Dean continues to be celebrated for his outstanding talent and contributions to cinema."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, let's first move \\"8\\" to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides, like this: -8 * l + 8 - 8 = 0 - 8 This gives us: -8 * l = -8 4. Now, we want to get l by itself. So, we need to get rid of the -8 that's being multiplied with l. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -8. It looks like this: -8 * l / -8 = -8 / -8 5. Now, we can cancel -8 on both sides. This leaves us with: l = 1 So, the solution for l in the equation -8 * l + 8 = 0 is l = 1.

We've judged it as bad,rather than saying, \\"It's not bad or good, and it just is it.\\" In one of my books, I said, \\"You should expect people to mess up and expect things to go differently than you planned\\". Some readers said it's too sorrowful to expect things to go wrong.However, it's only negative if you see it as negative and judge it as bad. Instead,you could accept it as the way the world works and try to understand why that is. This can be applied to whatever you do:how other people act at work,how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are,and try to understand why they're that way. _ will save you a lot of sadness,because you'll no longer say, \\"Oh, I wish bad things didn't happen!'' Does it mean you can never change things? Not at all. But change things not because you can't accept things as they are, but because you enjoy the process of changing, learning and growing. Can we make this world a better place? You can say that you'll continue to try to do things to help others, to grow as a person, to make a difference in this world. That's the correct path you choose to take,because you enjoy that path. Therefore, when you find yourself judging and wishing for difference, try a different approach: accept, and understand. It might lead to some interesting results. Question: The author believes that we feel unhappy maybe because _ .

This brief statement has an unfavorable connotation, implying that the movie has poorly executed elements or is of low quality in terms of its filmmaking techniques. In this context, \\"bad\\" refers to an unfavorable or negative quality, possibly pertaining to a combination of factors, such as a lackluster screenplay, weak dialogues, unconvincing acting, amateurish editing, off-putting sound design, or subpar cinematography. The word \\"filmmaking\\" encompasses the entire process, which includes everything from pre-production to post-production, of creating a film, and so when preceded by \\"bad,\\" it denotes a poor outcome. However, keep in mind that this sentence is quite short, and it lacks specific details about which aspects of filmmaking were unsatisfactory. A more thorough analysis would require a larger or more detailed review that elaborates on the reasoning behind the critique and whether any aspects of the movie were redeemable. Sentiment analysis is typically conducted on more extensive pieces of text to accurately gauge the overall feeling that the reviewer is conveying.

More delegates to the presidential nominating conventions can be won on Super Tuesday than on any other single day of the primary calendar. Since Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses are typically held in a large number of states from geographically and socially diverse regions of the country, it typically represents a presidential candidate's first test of national electability. Thus, candidates seeking the presidency traditionally must do well on this day to help secure their party's nomination. In fact, convincing wins in Super Tuesday primaries have usually propelled candidates to their party's nomination. Super Tuesday is in either February or March of the presidential election year. During the 2016 election year, Super Tuesday was held on March 1. - The Potomac primary (named after the river that splits the region), also called Chesapeake Tuesday, the Beltway primary, and the Crabcake primary, is the confluence of three Democratic presidential primaries and three Republican presidential primaries that takes place after Super Tuesday. - The 2008 Virginia Republican primary took place on February 12 , 2008 .

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... and the situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Answer the following question: Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? A:","completion":"Given the background information provided, PepsiCo supplies farmers with genetically modified organism (GMO) potato seeds, while Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds. One of the attributes of GMO crops is increased herbicide tolerance. This means that the GMO potatoes provided by PepsiCo would have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides like glyphosate, without suffering any harm. On the other hand, Kettle Foods' non-GMO potatoes would not have this specific gene modification, making them less likely to have the same level of herbicide tolerance as compared to the GMO potatoes supplied by PepsiCo. Therefore, it can be concluded that PepsiCo potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' potatoes."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Herb Kline","completion":"Title: The Shadows of Herb Kline Genre: Crime/Thriller/Mystery Plot: Alex Turner, an ambitious detective with a tragic past, has just been assigned his first case after a long period of desk duties. A corpse under the name of Herb Kline is found in a seedy motel room, with no identification other than the registration card and the modest personal belongings inside the room. Clues scattered all over indicate that Herb's death wasn't an accident, but a well-planned murder. During his early investigations, Alex discovers that Herb Kline was a reporter who had recently vanished after revealing a corrupt senator's shady dealings. Although the senator is the primary suspect, his watertight alibi pushes Alex to broaden his search for the true perpetrator. In an unexpected twist, surveillance footage reveals a woman named Emily Harris entering Herb's room on the night of the murder. Emily, a struggling artist, was in a tumultuous romantic relationship with Herb since their high-school days. Grappling with personal demons, she becomes the new prime suspect due to her erratic behavior and questionable past. As Alex delves further into the case, he finds an encrypted flash drive among Herb's personal belongings, containing damning evidence against a notorious criminal organization, The Serpents. Intrigued, Alex realizes that Herb was merely a pawn in a much larger, dangerous game. Forced to join forces with Emily, the two find themselves at the mercy of the merciless criminal organization. Amid this chaos, Alex uncovers Herb's last project — exposing The Serpents' nefarious activities and bringing down their empire. Risking their lives, Alex and Emily embark on a relentless pursuit of justice for Herb, where every new lead unveils a dark and intricate web of deception. As the final act unfolds, the senator is revealed to be the leader of The Serpents, and he had orchestrated both Herb's murder and the seduction of Emily to use her as a scapegoat. Alex pieces together the final piece of the puzzle, and after a pulse-pounding chase, the film culminates in a heart-wrenching finale where the senator pays for his deeds at the hands of the law, and Alex and Emily emerge as unexpected allies. The film concludes with Alex finally reconciling with his tragic past, finding solace in the friendship forged with Emily during their traumatic, yet transformative journey. The Shadows of Herb Kline is a story filled with shades of deceit, intrigue, and redemption. With a complex, labyrinthine narrative, it explores the idea that even in the darkest hour, the resilience of the human spirit can triumph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the voices are high-pitched, others deeper but unmistakably youthful — kids; their joyful noise fills the air. This is the sound every parent wants to hear: carefree, happy children. “We like to think we put a smile on someone’s face every time we get a win” —Newtown High running back Cooper Gold This is what’s going on now in Newtown, Conn., a town that’s ready to change the focus from last December, if only everyone would let it. The town that will be forever known as home to one of the nation’s worst mass shootings, when a gunman killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School nearly one year ago, is currently home to another story — one that is helping to lift the spirits of the people of the picturesque, All-American town and perhaps write a new history. Newtown High School’s football team stands a perfect 12-0 after a rain-soaked, run-fueled 42-7 drubbing of rival Masuk in its regular-season finale on Tuesday night. Newtown High running back Cooper Gold was unstoppable Tuesday night, running for 256 yards and five scores in less than three quarters of action in a 42-7 win over Masuk that capped an undefeated regular season. It gets better. Newtown High is ranked No. 1 in Class LL, the division where the state’s biggest schools reside. The Nighthawks are in the top 10 in the state in passing yards, having outscored their opposition 439-138. And Newtown will be the top seed in the state playoffs when they kick off next Tuesday with a home game against a team still to be determined. “We like to think we put a smile on someone’s face every time we get a win,” running back Cooper Gold said after rushing for 256 yards and five touchdowns in less than three quarters of playing time on Tuesday. “There’s a lot of good things going on here . . . that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.” —Newtown High head coach Steve George Cooper Gold. What an All-American name, right? Newtown is that kind of city, a quaint little postcard of a place that proudly flies a giant American flag high above the middle of its tree-lined Main Street. It’s the kind of town that Steve George has never wanted to leave. He is Newtown’s coach. He was born and raised there, and was part of Newtown’s last state championship football team in 1992. He’s now in his seventh year as head coach of the Nighthawks. “I’ve seen some great things happen in Newtown,” George said. “I sort of think that’s what we should be known for. There’s a lot of good things going on here. There’s a lot of great sports teams, there are great academics, and great things that go on in our schools that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.” One only need look to this week to realize the truth of those words. As Newtown’s football team writes a story that gains national attention, the Sandy Hook tragedy has boomeranged back into the public eye, too. On Monday, the day before Newtown’s final regular-season game, the Connecticut State Attorney’s official summary report on the shootings was released. On Tuesday, the day of the game, a judge ordered that the 911 calls from the shooting be made public. And if the team reaches its goal of the state championship game, it could take place on Dec. 14, the one-year anniversary of the massacre. With a perfect run through the regular season complete, the Newtown High football team now sets its sights on the playoffs, and a potential championship game on the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shootings. All of that seems unfair, but even when the reminders are not as obvious, as glaring, they are still there in some form, and in some instances, self-created. All season, for example, the Nighthawks have worn a helmet with a specially designed logo, which includes the number “26” as a tribute to the 26 victims killed in the massacre. The logo also contains green (Sandy Hook’s colors were green and white). Many fans taking in Tuesday’s game do so by filling up the visitor’s bleachers wearing jackets with green or white ribbons. “As much as we have a rivalry with Newtown, we’ve supported them in the tragedy they had to deal with, and we still do” —Dave Brennan, head coach of Newtown High rival Masuk High That Newtown’s final regular-season win would come in Monroe was in some ways fitting. Monroe is Newtown’s direct neighbor to the south, and its most hospitable one, as well — the town that rallied most swiftly to its side. When it was determined that the Sandy Hook Elementary School would be closed indefinitely, it was Monroe that volunteered the use of one of its campuses, Chalk Hill School, which had been closed the year before. Working quickly, students, employees and volunteers in the Monroe district rallied to prepare the building and make the sudden transplants feel at home. The school is still the temporary home of the students of Sandy Hook, less than 10 miles from the school they used to hold dear. Earlier this month, the Sandy Hook complex was demolished for good. A new school will soon rise in its place. “As much as we have a rivalry with Newtown, we’ve supported them in the tragedy they had to deal with, and we still do,” said Masuk coach Dave Brennan, whose team was eliminated from playoff contention with a 7-4 record. “Does it lessen the sting of a loss like this? Never. You always want to compete when you have a chance to play football, but this is what makes our sport so wonderful.” Rain was certainly in the air in Monroe on Tuesday night, but so was something else — the sound of laughter coming from the stands of the visiting Newtown High fans. To wit, when the clock expired, even the remaining Masuk faithful gave the victors a hand. Newtown is so small — about 28,000 at last count — that nearly every resident had some personal connection to the shooting, however indirect. While none of the football team’s players reportedly had any relation to victims of the tragedy, about 10-15 had gone to elementary school at Sandy Hook, as had two coaches. So on opening day in September, Newtown High officially dedicated the season to all that were lost that horrific morning, wearing green and white jerseys with “Sandy Hook” on the front and “Stay Strong” on the back. Eleven weeks later, they are still carrying on their promise to the 26. On a gray night that saw rain falling softly for all four quarters, the joy in that could not be understated. When Gold left the game for the last time with his team up 35-7, when the offensive line was allowed a rare moment in the spotlight while being replaced late in the fourth, when the defense gamely dug in for a goal-line stand while up 35 points, it was made clear that these were boys embracing the challenge of chasing a dream. These were kids, happy and full of hope. To a town still healing, it was a sight and sound more meaningful, more perfect than the numbers 12 and 0. Title:","completion":"\\"Newtown High's Undefeated Football Team: Healing a Community Through Strength and Unity\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. No surprise there, as the SNP and pro-independence Greens have a majority at Holyrood. But the power to call a poll lies with Westminster - so the Holyrood parliament can press only for the start of negotiations about a date. The parliament has endorsed the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's preferred timetable suggesting a referendum would \\"most appropriately be between the autumn of 2018, when there is clarity over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and around the point at which the UK leaves the EU in spring 2019\\". The timing would have obvious advantages for the SNP - Theresa May would be distracted by Brexit and UK government departments would have little time to work on research designed to dent or destroy the economic case for independence. The prime minister and her advisers are all too aware of this - so what happens if Theresa May continues to dig her heels in and not only repeats \\"now is not that time\\" but suggests 2019 won't be the time either? Senior SNP sources dismiss the idea that, under these circumstances, Nicola Sturgeon will attempt to organise a 'consultative' referendum without Westminster agreement which would have no constitutional standing. So they will attempt to maintain pressure for a properly constituted, legally watertight referendum through sophisticated social media campaigning and - they hope - headline grabbing initiatives, such as declaring the economic case for independence is no longer reliant on oil revenues. According to her public statements, Nicola Sturgeon is suggesting there should only be a little bit of wriggle room on the timing of that referendum - \\"a bit beyond\\" Brexit. The reason for this is that the party's strategists have been conducting focus groups amongst those who firmly voted against independence last time. And they find that the timing argument is particularly resonant with those who voted No in the 2014 referendum and Remain in 2016. Hence you will hear Nicola Sturgeon use phrases such as having a vote \\"before it's too late\\" to appeal to this groupâ€¦though in reality, there seems little prospect of Scotland straightforwardly staying in the EU whenever a vote is held. Incidentally, she will also continue to use very warm words to describe the contribution made by EU citizens to Scotland as it is hoped that many of them will change their vote from No - because they had been worried an independent Scotland would have been out of the EU - to Yes. But privately the party's strategists are a little less concerned if the stated referendum timescale slips. Indeed, some relish the prospect. They see Theresa May as their not-so-secret weapon. SNP strategists believe that the longer Theresa May sets her face against a referendum after Brexit the more she will build support for independence. That's because they think some former No voters will object to her apparent disrespect for Scotland and be more open to the SNP's arguments that Westminster doesn't listen to the devolved Scottish parliament. And they point out they need just one in 20 voters to change their mind. The SNP manifesto made it clear there should be a second referendum either if there were \\"a significant and material change in circumstancesâ€¦such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\\" or \\"if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option for a majority of the Scottish people\\". While only the first criterion has been met, it's the view of senior SNP figures that the longer the prime minister delays \\"Indyref2\\" the more likely it is that the party can meet both criteria. But there are dangers. The biggest fear is that Theresa May tries to push the timescale not just beyond Brexit but beyond the next Scottish parliament elections in 2021. Of course, this would be denounced by Nationalists as a constitutional outrage. But their private worry is that the SNP's mandate for a second referendum might run out. The party currently forms a minority administration despite being more popular than their nearest rivals in Scotland - now the Conservatives, not Labour - by a wide margin. And it would take only a collapse in the vote of their (essential) independence allies, the Greens, in 2021 to put the project in jeopardy. In part this explains the decision to go hammer and tongs for a referendum in this parliament - and even before some serious questions on the currency and the exact route back to the EU are settled. But there is another challenge. Again privately, there are concerns about how the party will hold onto Yes voters who backed Brexit. Any backsliding to appease them - settling for EEA membership, not full EU membership, for example - might in turn alienate the 'No-to-Yes Remainers'. Nicola Sturgeon will undoubtedly confront these difficulties with boldness. She has already ignored the advice of senior officials by calling for the second referendum before, and not after, Article 50 is triggered. She is rather good at making the political weather. But the polls suggest she hasn't yet changed the climate of Scottish public opinion. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The text is about Scotland's political party called the SNP and their leader Nicola Sturgeon. They want to have another vote to see if Scotland should be independent from the United Kingdom. There are some challenges and disagreements on when the vote should happen. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, wants it to happen later. Some people in Scotland would be unhappy if the vote happens very late. Nicola Sturgeon will have to make choices and find a way to make the vote happen.

Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl.

Paragraph: Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. Question: \\"Why does the Illinois Supreme Court want to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers?\\" Answer: \\"They want to increase the rates to give services to the poor and to help lawyers with drug and alcohol problems\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The Illinois Supreme Court wants to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers to bolster pro-bono services, which provide legal assistance to the poor, and to support lawyers struggling with drug and alcohol problems. The fee hikes aim to address the declining revenues generated by the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which normally supports non-profit legal aid groups, but has been affected by low-interest rates and a sagging economy. By raising the registration fees, the high court intends to counter the shortfall in interest income and ensure that these essential services have adequate financial support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My best friend Rose and I used to dream about raising a family of our own someday and living next door to one another. Our dream remained alive through school and beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I married Dick. Later, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we moved. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. We remained in touch for a few years before we lost track. I thought of her several times over the years. All of my children now have families of their own, and Dick passed away a few years ago. Basically, a lifetime has passed. Then one day, near my 80th birthday, I received a phone call \\"Hi Natalie, it's Rose,\\" the voice on the other end said, \\" I don't know if you remember me, but we used to be best friends in Jamaica Plain when we were kids.\\" We have spent hours on the phone catching up.

We both share a passion for several hobbies that we each picked up independently several years after we lost touch with one another. It almost feels like we are picking up right where we left off.

In 1602 O'Neill destroyed his capital at Dungannon due to the approach of Mountjoy's forces, and withdrew to hide in the woods. In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian Óg O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\". - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred. - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance. - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 . - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles. - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom. - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris. - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

La vena cava superior es un importante vaso sanguíneo que se encarga de transportar la sangre sin oxígeno, que proviene de la parte superior del cuerpo humano, de vuelta al corazón. Esta sangre se ha utilizado en los tejidos y órganos de la parte superior del cuerpo, y una vez que ha entregado su oxígeno y nutrientes, necesita ser bombeada de nuevo al corazón para recoger más oxígeno y nutrientes y continuar con su circulación. La sangre desoxigenada llega a la vena cava superior a través de las venas subclavias y las venas yugulares internas, que drenan la sangre del cuello, la cabeza y los brazos. A medida que estos vasos sanguíneos se unen, forman la vena cava superior, que se localiza en el mediastino superior, cerca de la base del corazón. La vena cava superior se desplaza hacia abajo y se fusiona con la aurícula derecha del corazón, que es la cámara superior derecha del órgano. Desde aquí, la sangre fluye hacia el ventrículo derecho, donde es bombeada a los pulmones para recoger oxígeno antes de regresar al corazón y ser enviada nuevamente a todas las partes del cuerpo.

How can I protect a cell phone from the rain?","completion":"Protecting your cell phone from rain is crucial, as water can cause severe damage to your device, impacting both its functionality and efficiency. To protect your cell phone from rain, you may consider implementing some of the following steps and precautions: 1. Invest in a waterproof case: Waterproof cases are designed specifically to protect your phone from water damage. Choose a case with a high water resistance rating, such as an IP67 or IP68 rating, which means the case is capable of withstanding water immersion for certain periods of time. There is a wide variety of waterproof cases available, ranging from slim designs to more rugged options that also offer drop and shock protection. 2. Use a ziplock bag: In the absence of a waterproof case, consider using a ziplock bag as a temporary solution. Place your phone inside the bag and ensure it's completely sealed. While this won't allow for full functionality, it will protect the phone from direct contact with water. 3. DIY waterproof pouch: You can also create your waterproof pouch using some waterproof material, such as TPU or PVC fabric, and then adding a waterproof closure system, such as a waterproof zipper or Velcro strips. Ensure that the pouch is sized to fit your phone and provides a reliable seal against water. 4. Avoid using the phone in heavy rain: If possible, avoid using your cell phone during heavy rainstorms. Wait until you are indoors or under shelter to use your device. If you must use your phone, try to shield it under an umbrella or any other waterproof barrier while you're making calls, texting, or using the touchscreen. 5. Keep your phone in an inner pocket: When walking in the rain, store your phone in an inner pocket of your coat or bag to shield it from direct exposure to rain. A waterproof backpack or shoulder bag can add extra protection. 6. Use a Bluetooth headset or earphones: If you need to make calls during the rain, use a Bluetooth headset or wired earphones to avoid exposing your phone to the rain directly. This helps you keep your phone safe inside the waterproof case or ziplock bag, while still being able to communicate hands-free. 7. Dry your phone immediately if it gets wet: If your phone gets wet, immediately power it off and wipe it down with a soft, dry cloth. Remove the battery, if possible, and avoid using any devices with wet ports or connectors. You can also place your phone in a container with uncooked rice or silica gel packets to absorb any water that may have penetrated the device. Allow it to dry for at least 24-48 hours before attempting to turn it back on. 8. Invest in a waterproof phone: If you often find yourself in situations where your phone is exposed to rain, you may want to consider purchasing a phone with built-in waterproof features. Many modern smartphones have water resistance ratings and can withstand a certain extent of exposure to water. By employing some or all of these measures, you can effectively protect your cell phone from rain and minimize the risk of water damage. Always remember that prevention is better than repair when it comes to safeguarding your device against water-related damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Process: - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more calm waters happens, how will it affect there is less current in the sea. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more calm waters would have an indirect effect on the process. Step-by-step analysis: 1. If the waters are calmer, there will be less energy in the waves. 2. When there is less energy in the waves, they will carry less sediment from the ocean and hit the beach with less force. 3. With less forceful impact on the rocks and sand, the wind and current will not push the water and particles as hard. 4. Since tiny parts of the rocks are chipped off with less force, fewer small rocks and sand particles will be broken off from larger rocks. 5. The waves will still pick up sand and small rocks from the beach, but in smaller amounts due to the reduced energy. 6. The waves will continue to go back out into the ocean, carrying the new particles, but the overall process will be slower and less noticeable. 7. As a result, the rocks and the beach will look slightly different, but the changes will be less significant and occur at a slower rate compared to a situation with more energetic waters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film \\"The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh\\" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller, \\"The Case of the Scorpion's Tail.\\" Like his earlier effort, this one stars handsome macho dude George Hilton, who would go on to star in Martino's Satanic/giallo hybrid \\"All the Colors of the Dark\\" the following year. \\"Scorpion's Tail\\" also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would go on to portray an unhappy couple (to put it mildly!) in Martino's \\"Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key\\" (1972). (I just love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot this! Anyway, this film boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans would expect, as well as a twisty plot, some finely done murder set pieces, and beautiful Athenian location shooting. The story this time concerns an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like Farrah Fawcett's prettier, smarter sister) who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of 1 million by a beautiful widow. I really thought I had this picture figured out halfway through, but I was dead wrong. Although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo, I may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. Highlights of the picture, for me, were Anita's cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end, a particularly suspenseful house break-in, and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie!

While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. But I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions.

Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots . Somewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me. I meet and talk with interesting people along the way. Enjoying beautiful scenes, meeting wild animals(usually at my camping site), and traveling up and down hills also make me cheerful. On the other hand, I may run into rainy or hot days, have to repair my bike, or just find myself in a bad state. The problems are easily dealt with. The pleasures remain in my mind for years.

From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted with warm smiles and an inviting atmosphere. The lighting was soft and soothing, accentuating the rustic yet modern decor that truly made me feel like I was in a European oasis. Upon being seated, the hostess kindly provided a complimentary glass of sparkling wine, which was a lovely and unexpected touch. The extensive menu offered a diverse range of exquisite dishes, making it hard to choose, but our attentive server, Mary, was more than helpful with her recommendations. To start, we shared the flavorsome wild mushroom risotto, which turned out to be the perfect choice. The creaminess and depth of flavors with each bite were mouth-watering, and the fresh herbs added a clean note to the dish. Next, we opted for the pan-seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection. The delicate balance between the golden crust, tender scallops, and the zesty lemon-garlic sauce was simply divine. For our main courses, I tried the succulent, slow-cooked beef short rib, which melted in my mouth and was neatly paired with a gorgeous red wine jus and seasonal vegetables. My partner had the pan-roasted salmon with a delightful citrus beurre blanc sauce. The salmon was cooked flawlessly, with the right balance of flavors. The wine menu was quite impressive, showcasing a wide selection of local and international varieties to cater to all preferences. Our server helped us choose a bottle of red wine that complemented our meal beautifully. Now, I cannot possibly review Le Gourmet Bistro without mentioning the heavenly dessert. I indulged in the chocolate lava cake, a decadent masterpiece with its rich, gooey center and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. My partner savored the light and fruity mixed berry pavlova, which had a perfect balance of sweetness and tangy notes. From the attentive, personable service to the carefully crafted dishes and impressive wine selection, our experience at Le Gourmet Bistro was an absolute delight. The attention to detail in the presentation and the explosion of flavors in each dish showcased the genuine love and passion for fine cuisine coming from the talented chefs. I cannot wait to return to Le Gourmet Bistro for another unforgettable dining experience! Highly recommend – a well-deserved 5-star rating!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might he got for more? - windows 95 - school - ammunition shop - office supply store - desk The best answer is The answer is:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Sam ran out of clipboards. Where might he go for more?\\" is the option \\"office supply store.\\" Going into detail, the rationale behind choosing the office supply store as the best option is straightforward. Office supply stores are known for carrying a diverse range of items that are specifically designed for office, educational, and organizational use. These stores stock various products such as paper, pens, pencils, folders, binders, staplers, desk organizers, printing supplies, and, most importantly, clipboards. If Sam needs to urgently replenish his stock of clipboards, the office supply store is the most logical and reliable place to find them. The store will likely carry different types and sizes of clipboards. Whether Sam needs a small clipboard for holding notepads or a larger one for hefty stacks of papers, the office supply store will undoubtedly have what he is looking for. Now, let's explore why the other options listed are not the best choices for Sam to obtain more clipboards: 1. Windows 95: Windows 95 is an operating system developed by Microsoft, released in 1995. It is a piece of software designed to manage a computer's hardware and software resources, and it has no connection to providing physical items like clipboards. Consequently, it is not a valid option for Sam's situation. 2. School: While it is true that schools often have clipboards for various purposes like classroom instruction, presentations, and administrative tasks, Sam might not have direct access to these supplies. Schools usually purchase clipboards in bulk for their specific needs and may not sell them individually to students or external individuals. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate for Sam to take clipboards from a school, as those items belong to the institution. 3. Ammunition shop: An ammunition shop primarily focuses on selling firearms and related accessories. While it is possible that such a store might incidentally carry a clipboard or two for inventory management or documentation purposes, it is highly unlikely that an ammunition shop would have a proper stock of clipboards for sale. Therefore, it is not an ideal place for Sam to find the clipboards he needs. 4. Desk: A desk may occasionally have a clipboard or two lying around, but it is not a place where one can expect to find or purchase new clipboards consistently. Rather, a desk is meant for organizing and storing work materials, not providing a steady supply of clipboards. In conclusion, when considering all the options presented, the office supply store stands out as the most practical and reliable choice for Sam to obtain more clipboards. The store specializes in providing a wide range of office and organizational supplies, which will cater precisely to Sam's needs, whereas the other options are either irrelevant or unlikely to offer an adequate selection of clipboards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook \\"Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats\\" lists this condition as \\"very common\\" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age. Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time Disc disease: This is another \\"common\\" condition, especially as Cavaliers age. Most of the time, you won't know that your Cavalier is prone to slip discs, until you see it walking stiffly or reluctantly lowering its head to its food or water bowl.","completion":"The article discusses the characteristics and potential health issues of purebred Cavaliers, emphasizing their predictable traits such as energy and lovable temperament, while also warning about potential health risks due to inbreeding and limited gene pools, which include heart disease, neurological issues, epilepsy, and disc disease, along with the possible variations in traits in non-purebred Cavaliers mixed with other breeds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But she is unhappily married to, and separated from, temperamental producer Carter Lang and also chronically depressed and institutionalized. Reflecting back on what brought her here, Maria recalls driving around Los Angeles in her yellow Chevrolet Corvette and spending time with her closest friend, B.Z. Mendenhall, an unhappy man who is gay. Maria has a brain-damaged daughter, Kate, who is being kept in a sanitarium at the insistence of Carter, who resents Maria visiting the girl so frequently. Maria's secret desire is to live somewhere with Kate and find some kind of joy in life together. Maria has been having an affair with Les Goodwin, a screenwriter. When she tells Carter she is pregnant, he demands she get an abortion.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Which is safer --- staying at home, traveling to work on public transport, or working at the office? Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

He added that many observers saw Mr Sinofsky as a potential successor to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive. In a letter to all employees, published by Forbes, Mr Sinofsky set out to quell the rumours about his departure. \\"Some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing. I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read - about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership,\\" he said.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Over the past few months, she had accumulated enough savings to finally buy the handbags she had been eyeing for so long.

On the other hand, Christine had also saved her money with a specific goal in mind. However, her priorities were a little different from Tanya's. Christine had been working hard to save her money to treat herself to a relaxing and rejuvenating spa day. She knew the importance of self-care and believed that it would benefit her mental and physical well-being greatly. While she did appreciate the beauty of the handbags Tanya purchased, Christine felt that her savings would be better spent on an experience that could help her recharge and refocus her energies.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin. Answer the following question: In which case melanocytes would produce less melanin, case D or case L?

Translate to English","completion":"Should the offered goods be sold out, the promotion will end prematurely. In this sentence, the original German text mentions that if the goods available in a promotional offer are sold out, the promotion will come to an early or unexpected end. In the translation to English, the sentence is rendered in a way that keeps the same essential meaning while ensuring that it reads smoothly and coherently for an English-speaking audience. In order to further understand the broader context of the given sentence, we can analyze each of its components: 1. \\"Sollten die angebotenen Waren ausverkauft sein\\" (Should the offered goods be sold out) - This part of the sentence refers to a situation in which all available goods that are part of a promotion or special offer are sold out, leaving no more inventory available for customers. This could be the case if the demand for these items was higher than anticipated or if the available stock was limited. 2. \\"endet die Aktion vorzeitig\\" (the promotion will end prematurely) - The second part of the sentence explains the consequences of the situation described in the first part. Since there are no more goods available for the promotion, the promotion will end earlier than planned or expected. This can happen when a promotion is highly successful, and customers quickly take advantage of the offer, or when the available stock happens to not be sufficient to meet the demand during the entire duration of the promotion. From this analysis, the English translation captures the essence of the German sentence, conveying the same intended meaning while ensuring clarity and coherence for English-speaking readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"From the given sentence, we can extract several pieces of data: 1. A person named Ranil Wickremesinghe: The sentence mentions an individual named Ranil Wickremesinghe, identifying him as a notable figure. 2. Leadership position: The sentence states that Ranil Wickremesinghe holds a leadership position within Tamil speaking Sri Lanka. However, it does not specify the precise role or title (e.g., Prime Minister, President, or a political party leader). 3. Tamil speaking Sri Lanka: The phrase \\"Tamil speaking Sri Lanka\\" indicates a specific region or community within Sri Lanka where the Tamil language is predominantly spoken. This could refer to the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka or a broader population of Tamil speakers within the country. 4. Adisham Hall: The sentence mentions a place called \\"Adisham Hall.\\" Based on the context, Adisham Hall appears to be a significant landmark or building located within the area where Ranil Wickremesinghe leads. Given this sentence alone, it is difficult to deduce the context and chronological order of the data extracted. However, some possible connections and additional information can be considered: - Ranil Wickremesinghe might be currently holding or have previously held a political position that directly impacts or represents the Tamil speaking population of Sri Lanka. - Adisham Hall may be a culturally or politically significant site for the Tamil speaking communities or for the leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, himself. - The mention of these specific details could imply that Tamil language, culture, or politics play a substantial role in the surrounding context of this sentence. To have a better understanding of the extracted data and its significance, further context and research are needed. Additional information about Ranil Wickremesinghe's political career, Tamil speaking regions in Sri Lanka, and the history or purpose of Adisham Hall will help in providing a more complete understanding of the data's implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Combine like terms (constants). -121993 + 25764 - 4338 = -121993 + (25764 - 4338) = -121993 + 21426 = -100567 Now, our equation becomes: -1501*i - 100567 = 0 Step 2: Isolate i. To isolate i, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation: -1501*i = 100567 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of i. Finally, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -1501: i = 100567 / -1501 Step 4: Calculate the value of i. i ≈ -66.999 Hence, the solution for i is approximately -66.999."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? The woman listened to music on the radio instead of her phone because the","completion":"The woman listened to music on the radio instead of her phone because the experience provided her with a sense of nostalgia and connection to the world around her that she found lacking while using her phone. To further understand her decision, it is important to understand the various factors that contribute to the experience of listening to music on the radio as opposed to a phone. 1. Sense of Nostalgia: For many people, listening to radio can remind them of times when technology was not as advanced and they spent their days listening to their favorite stations and discovering new music. Many individuals might have fond memories associated with listening to the radio – road trips, late-night study sessions, or time spent with family and friends. For the woman in the sentence, the nostalgia factor might have played a significant role in her choice to listen to the radio rather than her phone. 2. Curated Content: One of the great aspects of radio stations is that they are often curated by knowledgeable DJs, who may have a good understanding of the music scene and a passion for sharing great tunes. They have the ability to create an unexpected and exciting listening experience, with tracks that the listener might have never heard before or had forgotten about. With streaming services on phones, users typically have to actively search for new music, and algorithms may limit their exposure to different genres and artists outside their frequently played tracks. 3. Connection to the World: Tuning into a radio station allows the listener to feel a sense of connection, as they know that others are simultaneously listening to the same music. The DJs' chatter about local events, news and announcements enhances this connection, as the listener can feel more involved in their community. Moreover, radio stations often unite people from diverse backgrounds, creating a shared experience. In comparison, listening to music on a phone may feel more isolating, as the experience is more personalized and doesn't evoke the same community feeling. 4. Limited Control: When listening to the radio, one is at the mercy of the station and DJ's playlist, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. Limited control can lead to a sense of anticipation as well as surprise when a beloved song is played. This can be a refreshing change from the instant gratification that smartphones provide, where users have the ability to skip songs, create personalized playlists and hand-pick their favorite tracks. 5. Cost and Accessibility: Finally, one cannot ignore the practical aspect of listening to the radio. Tuning into a station is free and requires no internet connection, making it more accessible to a wider audience. The simplicity of turning on a radio and effortlessly enjoying music without the need for data plans, subscriptions or battery power may have enticed the woman to choose this option over her phone. In conclusion, the woman's choice to listen to music on the radio instead of her phone is influenced by factors such as nostalgia, the curated content provided by radio stations, connection to the world and the community around her, the thrill of limited control and the cost and accessibility of radio. The experience of listening to the radio can evoke emotions and a sense of connection that may be lacking when listening to music through a smartphone, and people may choose this option as a deliberate and conscious break from a technology-driven world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The wrong answers are: - The dog enjoys being washed out: Shedding is not about washing the dog, it's about losing hair. - Washing all the fur is easy: This answer doesn't make sense because shedding is about losing hair, not washing it. - The fur is still attached to the skin: Shedding means that the hair is falling out, so it's not attached to the skin anymore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead.

Joseph Anthony Pereira (born September 10, 1950), better known by his stage name Joe Perry, is the lead guitarist, backing and occasional lead vocalist, and contributing songwriter for the American rock band Aerosmith. He was ranked 84th in Rolling Stone's list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Aerosmith, and in 2013, Perry and his songwriting partner Steven Tyler were recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award and were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2014, Simon & Schuster released Rocks: During Perry's early years he formed a band with Tom Hamilton called The Jam Band. Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer eventually joined them and the band became Aerosmith. While initially dismissed as The Rolling Stones knock-offs, the band came into its own during the mid-1970s with a string of hit records. Chief among these successes were Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976), thanks largely to the prevalence of free-form, album-oriented FM radio. The group also managed hit singles on the radio with songs like \\"Dream On\\", \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\", \\"Sweet Emotion\\", \\"Walk This Way\\", \\"Back in the Saddle\\", and \\"Last Child\\". During this time, Perry and Tyler became known as the \\"Toxic Twins\\" for their notorious hard-partying and drug use. Aerosmith's crowd earned the nickname \\"The Blue Army\\", so called by the band after the seemingly endless number of teenagers in the audience wearing blue denim jackets and blue jeans. The audience was abundantly male with long hair. Following Rocks, the group began to stumble. Drug use escalated and the creative process became hampered by strained relationships within the band. This was highlighted during the recording process for their next album, which was recorded at an abandoned convent in upstate New York. During their time there, Tyler and Perry would spend much of the time in their rooms getting high, away from the rest of the band, and would often record their parts separately. The band, hampered by heavy drug use and distracted by hobbies such as driving fast cars on the nearby parkways and shooting high-powered firearms in the building's attic, struggled to come up with material. Draw the Line, released in 1977, became a hit nonetheless, going double Platinum. However, it was not as successful as their prior efforts, with the singles \\"Draw the Line\\" and \\"Kings and Queens\\" both charting in the Hot 100, but failing to crack the Top 40. On the album, Perry sang lead vocals on the track \\"Bright Light Fright\\". The band toured throughout 1977 and 1978 in support of the album, but increasing violence at concerts (such as bottles, cherry bombs, M-80s, and firecrackers being thrown on-stage, including several notorious incidents at The Spectrum in Philadelphia) as well as the band's heavy drug use began to mar the performances. In 1978, Aerosmith released the live collection Live! Bootleg, released the stand-alone single \\"Chip Away the Stone\\", and starred as \\"The Future Villain Band\\" in the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. For the film, the band released a cover of The Beatles' \\"Come Together\\", which would become the band's last Top 40 hit for nearly a decade.

Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to... Question: Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage as a sign of lying ?

If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \\"What a good exam that was!\\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it won't remember well. Work at the time when you know you'll work at your best. If you're studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \\"going round and round\\"--thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things. If you feel bad, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product they purchased based on their expectations. Their disappointment primarily stems from not being aware of the different types of remastering available for the original recording. They ended up with the version that has only 2 parts instead of 4, which they believe does not justify the amount they paid for it. Several factors contribute to the negative tone of the review: 1. Confusion: The reviewer did not realize the distinctions between the available types of remastering, implying that this information was not well-communicated or well-understood. 2. Disappointment: The reviewer's expectations were not met because the version they acquired only contained 2 parts instead of the 4 they expected. 3. Financial dissatisfaction: The reviewer feels that the money they spent on the product was not justified, considering the incomplete nature of the remastered version they acquired. 4. Implicit comparison: The mention of two different types of remastering may indicate that the reviewer believes the other version with 4 parts would have been worth the money, amplifying the negative tone. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is negative due to the reviewer's dissatisfaction based on their expectations, confusion regarding the different types of remastering available, and financial disappointment.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free.

Throughout her life, she was associated with two major political parties: Herut and Gahal. She actively participated in politics, playing essential roles and shaping the landscape of political discourse in Israel. Raziel-Naor's political career began with her involvement in the Herut party from 1949 to 1965. Herut was a nationalist political party in Israel that emerged from the Revisionist Zionist movement, a faction that sought a Jewish state in the entirety of Mandatory Palestine. During her tenure with the Herut party, she advocated for a strong and independent Israel, focusing on issues such as security, economy, and immigration. This period marked the beginning of her political journey and helped her establish a reputation as a dedicated leader. In 1965, Raziel-Naor transitioned to the Gahal party, where she was an active member until 1974. Gahal was an Israeli political alliance formed by the merger of the Herut party and the Liberal Party. She continued her political activism and leadership within the Gahal party, where her experience, dedication, and ability to address various issues contributed to the party's growth. Gahal became one of the dominant right-wing political forces in Israel during its existence, and Raziel-Naor's involvement significantly shaped the party's trajectory. Throughout her political career, Raziel-Naor became known for her steadfast commitment to Israel's development and the realization of the Zionist ideal. She actively participated in various parliamentary committees, ensuring that her voice and the interests of the people she represented were heard. Her diligent work and passion for her country earned her the respect of her contemporaries and a well-deserved place in Israel's political history. Esther Raziel-Naor passed away on November 11, 2002, at the age of 90. Her long-standing political career and legacy continue to influence and inspire future generations of political leaders and activists in Israel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

Please answer the following question: Question: What did The Bears do at the end of the movie? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bad News Bears Context: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important.

It has unraveled at breakneck speed, as Russia moved against Ukraine, effectively annexed part of its territory, and put its smaller neighbor on the brink of war. Moving from disbelief to dismay to horror, Europeans lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that Russia was a predictable and cooperative partner. Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now. However far-fetched they may seem, these comparisons reflect a frantic search among Western politicians and experts for the underlying causes, rationales and consequences of Russia's actions in Ukraine.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the name of the orchestra Boult worried would be placed in serious financial jeopardy should Russell remain in post? is inside the article: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on..., can you guess it ?

He's a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn't get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense?Okay, keep your answer in mind.The next question is for supporters of President Obama. Let's say your political views map closely to the President's positions. He's your guy. But suppose you found out he once killed an American citizen in the United States to help his reelection. And assume, as with the CEO example, that the facts of the killing are undisputed and the President found a legal means to avoid prosecution. In that hypothetical case, would you still vote for President Obama? Or would you say it is a firing offense for a President to kill a citizen to advance his career?I predict that every one of you favored firing the hypothetical CEO for killing a guy to get ahead. My second prediction is that every Republican reader of this blog favored firing President Obama in the hypothetical and imaginary case of him murdering a citizen to get elected. My third prediction is that supporters of President Obama will quibble with the hypothetical example, or my comparison to the CEO, or say President Obama is still a better option than Romney. In other words, for most supporters of President Obama, I don't think there is such a thing as a \\"firing offense.\\"For the record, President Obama did not technically kill anyone to get elected. That was just a hypothetical example. But he is putting an American citizen in jail for 10 years to life for operating medical marijuana dispensaries in California where it is legal under state law. And I assume the President - who has a well-documented history of extensive marijuana use in his youth - is clamping down on California dispensaries for political reasons, i.e. to get reelected. What other reason could there be?One could argue that the President is just doing his job and enforcing existing Federal laws. That's the opposite of what he said he would do before he was elected, but lying is obviously not a firing offense for politicians.Personally, I'd prefer death to spending the final decades of my life in prison. So while President Obama didn't technically kill a citizen, he is certainly ruining this fellow's life, and his family's lives, and the lives of countless other minor drug offenders. And he is doing it to advance his career. If that's not a firing offense, what the hell is?Romney is likely to continue the same drug policies as the Obama administration. But he's enough of a chameleon and a pragmatist that one can't be sure. And I'm fairly certain he'd want a second term. He might find it \\"economical\\" to use federal resources in other ways than attacking California voters. And he is vocal about promoting states' rights, so he's got political cover for ignoring dispensaries in states where medical marijuana is legal.So while I don't agree with Romney's positions on most topics, I'm endorsing him for president starting today. I think we need to set a minimum standard for presidential behavior, and jailing American citizens for political gain simply has to be a firing offense no matter how awesome you might be in other ways.: Congratulations to Politico for being the first to take this post out of context.

A key factor in his decision, wrote cartoonist Scott Adams, is what he described as President Barack Obama’s role in a ruling in federal court to send to prison a California man who operates a medical marijuana dispensary, with a sentence between 10 years and life. Text Size - + reset “And I assume the President — who has a well-documented history of extensive marijuana use in his youth — is clamping down on California dispensaries for political reasons, i.e. to get reelected,” Adams wrote, pinning blame for the man’s arrest on Obama. “What other reason could there be?” “Personally, I’d prefer death to spending the final decades of my life in prison,” Adams continued. “So while President Obama didn’t technically kill a citizen, he is certainly ruining this fellow’s life, and his family’s lives, and the lives of countless other minor drug offenders. And he is doing it to advance his career. If that’s not a firing offense, what the hell is?” Adams, who said that he disagrees with Romney on “most topics,” said “one can’t be sure” where Romney would stand on the subject — so he offered up his endorsement of the GOP nominee. “Romney is likely to continue the same drug policies as the Obama administration,” he wrote. “But he’s enough of a chameleon and a pragmatist that one can’t be sure.

Rancho Cucamonga resident Aaron Sandusky was convicted in a federal court Friday of two marijuana-related counts. The first is conspiracy to manufacture marijuana plants and maintain a drug-involved premises. The second count is possession of marijuana plants with intent to distribute -- which essentially means he was running a pot shop, notes LA Weekly. On each count, the jury found that Sandusky had worked with at least 1,000 marijuana plants. Sandusky, 41, faces a minimum of 10 years to life in prison. He was taken into custody after the trial and the sentencing hearing is scheduled for Jan. 2013. The charges stem from Sandusky's three medical marijuana collectives, known as \\"G3 Holisitic,\\" in the Inland Empire cities of Upland, Colton and Moreno Valley. The U.S. attorney's office had sent Sandusky letters in Oct. 2011 warning him that the stores were violating federal law, and in response Sandusky closed two of them. The next month, federal agents raided the remaining store, in Upland, twice. They seized marijuana plants and 11,500 in cash, effectively wiping out Sandusky's entire business. The conviction at the federal court level is a blow to the medical marijuana community in California, some of whom have been supporting Sandusky through a website raising money for his legal defense. His case also underscores the contrast between California -- which recognizes the medicinal properties of pot and protects marijuana dispensaries -- and federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal controlled substance with no accepted medical use. Federalism issues didn't come into play during the trial, which Zach Weissmueller, a writer for libertarian magazine Reason, believes weakened Sandusky's case. In a blog for Reason, Weissmueller writes: The federal government was successful in quelling any discussion of medical marijuana laws, federalism, or jury nullification--all of which were specters looming over the case when they discussed it in open court while jurors were not present. In closing statements, the federal prosecutors were sure to emphasize to jurors that personal feelings, political beliefs, and morals do not matter. The law is the law. One prosecutor instructed the jury \\"not to debate the law, but to apply the law.\\" If there was one important takeaway from the prosecution's closing, it was this phrase, emblazoned on one of their presentational slides: \\"Factual determination, not moral judgment.\\" Another point of contention during the trial was the fact that the judge did not allow Sandusky to claim entrapment based on President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's public statements on medical marijuana. Throughout his first campaign, Obama had said he wouldn't use federal resources to circumvent state laws about medical marijuana. During a 2009 press conference, Holder followed up on that promise, saying that federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries would be coming to an end unless the shops violated both state and federal law. Sandusky had been charged along with five others who worked at G3, all of whom took plea deals and avoided a trial. During the course of the trial, G3 co-founder and owner John Leslie Nuckolls II, one of the men charged, admitted to having worked for the county District Attorney's Office and the DEA, reports the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. In an August interview with ReasonTV (video above), Sandusky had called the conflict between California medical marijuana laws and federal drug laws a \\"constitutional battle\\" and vowed to defend the 10th Amendment right for states to pass their own laws. \\"If I have to go to jail for 20 years defending it, then so be it,\\" said Sandusky. \\"If a jury finds me guilty of violating federal law, then I'll go do the time.\\" ||||| Dilbert creator Scott Adams, last seen blaming society for being cruel to rapists and defending a chain email depicting President Obama as a chimpanzee, has now, appropriately enough, endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Coming, as it does, on the same day as the big Dennis Miller endorsement, it appears that Team Romney has now completely locked down the White Guys Who Laughed In 1993 demographic. While Adams’ endorsement is no surprise (other than the accompanying fact that Dilbert still exists), nor is it really news, his “logic” is worth more laughs than his comic strip ever was. First, some background. There are things called “newspapers” that are like a whole bunch of websites printed on paper, and in these newspapers are things called “comic strips.” Many of them are for kids, but there have been, like, three (The Far Side, Bloom County, Doonesbury, did I miss any?) funny ones for adults. Dilbert is one of the other kind, and it’s creator, Scott Adams, is a model citizen of entitled white male America. Like a lot of these guys, Adams gets his librul on when it comes to his own right to smoke weed or do whatever the eff he wants (aka “Libertarianism”), but gets all Republican-y when it comes time to pay for the society that protects and promotes his privileges. Thus, the premise of Adams’ endorsement is that President Obama has been too tough on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Mitt Romney will be better because he sucks so much. Or something like that. Also, the President kinda killed a guy, but not really. But he totally killed a guy: Let’s say a CEO does a great job for stockholders; he increases profits five-fold, treats the employees well, and causes the stock price to skyrocket. He’s a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn’t get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense? Well, the President didn’t kill a guy, but he did allow federal agents to enforce federal drug laws, which is kinda the same thing. Adams reasons that President Obama should be fired for enforcing laws that people like Mitt Romney will never allow to be changed. I don’t like the President’s record on medical marijuana, but in my imaginary business, I don’t fire the guy who killed one dude so I can hire Hannibal Lecter.

Given the following context: With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.

Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give \\"Les Bleus\\" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. \\"I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,\\" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. \\"Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,\\" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. \\"They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win.\\" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. \\"I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,\\" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. \\"The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.\\" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. \\"They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,\\" he said. \\"It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.\\" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. \\"The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,\\" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. \\"Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,\\" it said. \\"The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match.\\" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. \\"He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,\\" the defender said. \\"FIFA will probably be happy.

Write some highlights for the following article: An American student is in critical condition after undergoing two operations after chimpanzees tore at his body in front of tourists at a South African animal sanctuary, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. Andrew Oberle, a primatology student from the University of Texas at San Antonio, was being treated at a Johannesburg hospital after two chimps attacked him Thursday, spokeswoman Robyn Baard said. \\"He went though a 6-hour procedure of which doctors cleaned out his wounds and now it's a case of wait and see, and just to keep him sedated and comfortable for now,\\" she said. Oberle had been at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimp Eden since May, according to Eugene Cussons, the facility's managing director. Oberle was at the sanctuary, near Nelspruit, South Africa, for the second time after training and volunteering there in 2010. His training included an explanation about \\"no-go\\" areas, spaces for animals where people are not supposed to go. Witnesses to the attack said that Oberle went into a no-go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around, Cussons told CNN. Oberle crossed one barrier and approached a second one, which is a main fence with 24 strands of electrical wiring, Cussons said. Two male chimps grabbed Oberle and tried to drag him under the fence, but were not able to yank him into their enclosure. Zookeeper killed by wolves in Sweden. Cussons said he estimates the attack lasted 15 minutes. At some point, people tried to stop the chimps, and Cussons shot two rounds in the air to see if that might get them to retreat, he said. One of the chimps then charged at Cussons, he said. Cussons shot that chimp in the abdomen, he told CNN, and it seemed to shriek as a kind of signal to other chimps that there was a more powerful threat present. The chimps then backed off, he said. Oberle was rescued and transported for medical care. None of the 13 tourists, most of them from local areas, were harmed, officials said. The chimp that was shot had an operation at the Johannesburg zoo to repair damage to his small and large intestines. Hospital spokeswoman Baard declined to discuss the nature of Oberle's wounds. She said the student's parents had requested privacy, adding that they are \\"quite traumatized.\\" The sanctuary, which is featured in the Animal Planet program \\"Escape to Chimp Eden,\\" remains closed and its staff is receiving counseling, executive director David Oosthuizen said. There are no plans right now to euthanize the chimps involved in the attack, said Dries Pienaar, who is leading the investigation into the incident. He works for a parks agency that makes sure zoos, sanctuaries and breeding projects comply with the law. Pienaar told CNN that his preliminary findings are that human error is to blame, but he cautioned that his investigation is not complete and that he wants to interview Oberle. He hasn't spoken to all of the tourists yet, either. Chimp Eden was established as a home for rescued chimpanzees. Many of the primates have suffered \\"horrible injuries and abuse from humans,\\" according to the sanctuary. Neville Pillay, head of animal behavior at Wits University, said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual. \\"Chimpanzees are known to be violent, and they can kill other animals. And male chimpanzees are particularly strong,\\" he said. Dave Salmoni, an expert in large predators for Animal Planet, said abused and captive chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous, likening the chimps to troubled prison inmates. \\"Now this is a very nice prison, but it's a prison nonetheless,\\" he said Monday. \\"And that's why you can see a lot of acting out behavior, and in some cases, with chimpanzees, they act out just because they can.\\" Oberle was passionate about studying chimpanzees, his friend Anthony Reimherr told CNN affiliate KXAN. He said it was \\"intriguing\\" to listen to Oberle when he spoke about the animals. \\"It's just something that he loved to do, and I think it's something that he'll always continue to do,\\" Reimherr said.

He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates ( 1081 ) , sponsored by Irene Komnene , the emperor 's sister - in - law . It consists of about 7000 lines in the so - called political verse . It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation ; it was also translated into Bulgarian and Roman Slavic in the 14th century and enjoyed a great popularity . Chronicle edition : Bekker , Bonn 1837 ; the Bulgarian translation , by Bogdan and Bianu ( \`\` Cronica lui Constantin Manasses ) , Bucarest , 1922 . In 1969 Bulgaria issued two sets of stamps depicting important scenes of the chronicle , to celebrate it . Manasses also wrote the poetical romance Loves of Aristander and Callithea , also in political verse , is only known from the fragments preserved in the rose - garden of Macanus Chrysocephalus ( 14th century ) . Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects . - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps. - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118 24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean.

Material: cotton outside / inside with synthetic lining with padding Make this lower case","completion":"material: cotton outside / inside with synthetic lining with padding The material described above consists of a combination of natural and synthetic components. The outer layer is made from cotton, which is a popular natural fiber known for its softness, breathability, and durability. Cotton is obtained from the cotton plant and has been used in textile production for thousands of years, due to its numerous beneficial properties. Some of these properties include its ability to absorb moisture, its hypoallergenic nature, and its ability to provide insulation in cooler temperatures. On the other hand, the inside of the material features a synthetic lining with padding. Synthetic materials are created using artificial fibers or polymers and have a range of useful characteristics. Often, these materials are more cost-effective and versatile than natural fibers, making them ideal for use in various applications. Synthetic linings offer a range of benefits, such as being lightweight, quick-drying, and resistant to mildew and insects. Moreover, they can be engineered with specific properties to suit specific needs, such as being waterproof or fire-resistant. The padding within the synthetic lining provides added insulation and comfort. This could come in the form of foam, polyester fibers, or other synthetic materials that are designed to trap air and create a barrier between the body and the external environment. This added insulation helps to maintain the wearer's warmth, especially during colder months or in colder climates. One common use for this type of material is in the construction of garments like jackets, blankets, and similar items that require both warmth and moisture control. The combination of cotton on the outside and synthetic lining with padding on the inside creates a balanced and effective insulating and moisture-wicking system that promotes the user's comfort and well-being. In summary, the material described - cotton outside and inside with synthetic lining and padding - is an effective combination of natural and synthetic fibers that provide a range of beneficial properties.

I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Casey used Austin's procedure as an excuse to take two weeks off of work. Given the context: What does Casey need to do before this? The answer is:","completion":"Before Casey can utilize Austin's procedure as an excuse to take two weeks off work, there are several essential steps and actions he may need to undertake. 1. Understand Austin's Procedure: Obviously, before using Austin's procedure as a reason for a leave, Casey must first familiarize himself with what it involves entirely. Is it a medical procedure or a legal process? Is it something complex that requires a long recovery or preparation time? Understanding the procedure will provide him with a plausible explanation to give to his employer. 2. Assess Time Requirement: Casey must assess realistically how much time the procedure would actually require. This would include not only the time taken for the procedure itself but also any preliminary and follow-up phases involved. He must ensure that the two weeks he is planning to take off aligns with the actual time commitments the procedure requires. 3. Communication with Austin: Therefore, it's crucial for Casey to communicate with Austin. This could involve discussing his circumstances, understanding the timing and impact of the procedure, and asking about the possible consequences of taking an extended leave time off work. 4. Medical Consultation: If Austin's procedure is a medical one, a consultation with a healthcare professional is necessary. Casey should discuss with his healthcare provider about the procedure, acquire all necessary medical advice, secure any required appointments, and get a proper medical certificate attesting to his need for leave because of the procedure. 5. Formal Leave Application: Once certain about the time requirements, Casey should then formally apply for his leave of absence from work. This application should include all relevant details such as the reason for the leave (i.e., Austin's procedure), the length of the leave, and any supporting documentation required (like a doctor's certificate, legal paperwork, etc.). 6. Prepare for Procedure: Casey should make all necessary preparations for the procedure. This could be preparing himself physically, mentally, or allocating resources or making necessary arrangements for Austin's procedure and post-procedure recovery period. 7. Inform Key Parties: Before taking off, it is also fundamental that Casey informs anyone who will be directly affected by his absence. These could be colleagues who might need to take on extra work, or clients who may need to adjust their expectations during his leave. Clear communication can prevent possible complications or misunderstandings during his time off. 8. Arrange for Coverage: If Casey's work involves daily tasks that need coverage, it is crucial to make arrangements in advance so his duties are not neglected in his absence. Handing over duties or preparing a detailed work plan for whoever will cover him during these two weeks can help keep his work on track while he is away. 9. Prepare for Return: Lastly, depending on the type of his work, Casey might also need to prepare for his return to work. He should ensure that any tasks due on his return are either completed in advance or properly handed over to others. If Austin's procedure might have an impact on his performance initially, communicating this beforehand will help manage expectations on his return. Following these steps ensures a smooth transition both during the leave and upon his return, minimizing any potential disruption to his work."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identification: Vibhavadi Rangsit was a Thai Princess. It is important to note that this information is specifically relevant to the royal family member, and not the road by the same name, Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, in Thailand. The note ensures clarity for readers who might stumble upon the name without context. 2. Date of Birth and Death: She was born on the 20th of November, 1920, and died on the 16th of February, 1977. 3. Profession: She was renowned for her fiction writing, suggesting that she was a proficient author and a revered literary figure in addition to her royal ties. Although there is no explicit mention of her titles or her most well-known works, it implies a legacy of creative contribution to the Thai literary scene. 4. Social Involvement: Apart from being a writer, the Princess was also engaged in developmental work in rural Thailand. This showcases her commitment to societal growth and development, especially in areas that might lack sufficient resources or exposure. 5. Cause of Death: The write-up also provides significant information regarding the circumstances of her death. The Princess was tragically killed by communist insurgents, a detail which reveals political tensions during her lifetime. The context hints at her active role in society, as she was on a routine visit to assist rural villagers in Surat Thani Province when the incident occurred. Overall, even though the information presented on her seems succinct, her life was multifaceted, moving between artistic pursuits and social development.

Human behaviors and reactions often depend upon a multitude of factors including but not limited to: personality traits, relationship dynamics, contextual factors, and individual's current emotional state. In the context given, if Casey is being probed with a continuous reel of questions by Lee, it could potentially induce feelings of annoyance, confusion, or anger. Negative emotions may influence Casey to distance herself from the situation or the person causing such feelings, in this case, Lee. This kind of coping strategy is often referred to as an 'avoidance strategy' used when someone tries to remove or evade a stress source. However, the details offered aren't definitive and don't necessarily guarantee Casey's next action. Her response could also depend on her relationship with Lee, her emotional resilience, and her communication skills. If Casey is comfortable with the dynamics of her relationship with Lee, she might also choose to express her discomfort or ask him to limit his questions. Alternatively, she could change the subject, try to answer in short, unencouraging responses, or even attempt to turn the tables by questioning Lee in return. For instance, if Casey is a patient and polite person who doesn't like confronting people, she might prefer to tolerate the situation instead of walking away. If she values her relationship with Lee, she might not want to offend him by leaving or reacting negatively. Considering this, while \\"walk away from Lee\\" is a possible solution, it's not the only plausible one, as human behavior is complex and greatly shaped by internal and external factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term 'Bantoid' was first used by Krause in 1895 for languages that showed resemblances in vocabulary to Bantu. Greenberg in his 1963 \\"The Languages of Africa\\" defined Bantoid as the group to which (Narrow) Bantu belongs together with its closest relatives; this is the sense in which the term is still used today. The Bantoid languages probably do not actually form a coherent group. - The NigerCongo languages constitute one of the world's major language families, and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages. They may constitute the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages, although this question is complicated by ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language. - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. - Central Africa is a core region of the African continent which includes Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda. Middle Africa (as used by the United Nations when categorising geographic subregions) is an analogous term that includes Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe. All of the states in the UN subregion of Middle Africa, plus those otherwise commonly reckoned in Central Africa (11 states in total), constitute the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Since its independence in 2011, South Sudan has also been commonly included in the region. - In linguistics, mutual intelligibility is a relationship between languages or dialects in which speakers of different but related varieties can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is generally used as the most important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although sociolinguistic factors are often also used. - The Mbam languages are a group of erstwhile zone - A Bantu languages which some lexicostatistical studies suggest are not actually Bantu , but related Southern Bantoid languages . Janssens ( 1992 -- 93 ) posits that they are all of Guthrie 's zone A.60 languages , half of his A.40 languages , and perhaps Bube ( A.31 ) . Blench ( 2011 ) includes Jarawan in A.60 , and keeps both in Bantu . Sanaga ( A60 ) : Tuki ( Bacenga ) , Leti West Mbam ( A40 ) : Bati ( A60 ) , Nomaande ( Mandi ) -- Tunen ( Aling'a , Banen ) -- Tuotomb -- Yambeta , Nyokon Yambasa ( A60 ) : Nubaca , Mbule , Nugunu , Elip -- Mmaala -- Yangben Jarawan ( See ) ? Bube ( A31 ) - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - Ethnologue: Languages of the World is a web-based publication that contains statistics for 7,457 languages in its 19th edition, which was released in 2016. Of these, 7,097 are listed as living and 360 are listed as extinct. \\"Ethnologue\\" provides information on the number of speakers, location, dialects, linguistic affiliations, availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, and an estimate of language viability using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). The publication is well respected and widely used by linguists. - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of sanitizing dirty shoes, there are several methods one can consider. Ultimately, the best method depends on a variety of factors such as the type of shoes, material, level of dirtiness, and the desired level of sanitation. Below are four effective methods of sanitizing dirty shoes, along with the pros and cons of each method. 1. Handwashing with soap and water: Pros: - Simple and cost-effective - Can be done at home without any special equipment - Suitable for various types of shoes and materials Cons: - Can be time-consuming, especially for heavily soiled shoes - Not the most effective method for removing all germs - May lead to water damage and discoloration on some shoe materials (e.g., leather, delicate fabrics) 2. Washing in a washing machine: Pros: - Time-efficient, as the machine does most of the work - Can effectively remove dirt and some germs from shoes - Suitable for most casual shoes and sneakers Cons: - Not suitable for shoes made from delicate materials (e.g., leather, suede) or those with glued parts - The machine's agitation can cause physical damage or wear to some shoes - Reduced effectiveness on deep-set stains or significant amounts of mud 3. Using UV light technology: Pros: - Effectively kills bacteria, viruses, and other germs without using water or harmful chemicals - Carefully designed UV shoe sanitizers can be bought online or in retail stores - Suitable for various shoe types and materials, including delicate and non-washable materials Cons: - Generally more expensive compared to other methods - Does not physically remove dirt, dust, or mud from shoes - Requires access to electricity 4. Steam cleaning: Pros: - Can be a highly effective way to sanitize and clean shoes using just water - Effective on various types of shoes, works on most materials - Penetrates deep into the fabric, potentially removing deep-set dirt and stains Cons: - Requires a steam cleaner, which can be an expensive investment - Not suitable for shoes made from materials that can be damaged by high heat or moisture (e.g., leather, some delicate fabrics) - May not be as efficient in removing large amounts of mud or debris In summary, the most appropriate sanitation method for dirty shoes depends on a variety of factors. For shoes made from sturdy materials and without delicate parts, washing in a washing machine is a quick and effective option. Handwashing with soap and water can be an alternative for those who prefer a more gentle approach. UV light technology provides an ideal solution for sanitizing shoes without damage or water, while steam cleaning can deep clean and sanitize shoes using hot steam.

Initially, Mary expressed her frustration as she couldn't find her car and used an expletive to show her annoyance with the situation.

While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century.

The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement.

Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations B. because President Moon wants him to C. because he said he would D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity? Answer:","completion":"The Blue team's racers did not have their muscles prepared for the activity. As mentioned in the given paragraph, the White team warmed up properly before the race, which indicates that they effectively prepared their muscles for the upcoming physical activity. It is essential for athletes to warm up before engaging in any sport or rigorous activity, as it helps reduce the risk of injuries, improves flexibility, and increases the blood circulation to muscles, preparing them for the upcoming demand. In contrast, the Blue team arrived late due to transportation issues with the bus and did not have enough time to warm up before the start of the 5 km race. As a result, their racers did not have the opportunity to properly condition and prepare their muscles for the race, making them more prone to potential injuries, muscle strain, or overall less optimal performance during the competition. Warm-up exercises – including light aerobic activities, dynamic stretching, or sports-specific exercises – are crucial for athletes to prepare their bodies and ensure their muscles are ready to handle the stress, impact, and endurance of a race or other high-intensity activities.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town.

Answer:","completion":"Leukemia The question asks for a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated. In this case, the best answer among the given choices is leukemia. Cancer is a broad term for various diseases characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells, which can invade and damage healthy tissue. In particular, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Leukemia occurs when the DNA of immature blood cells, specifically the white blood cells, becomes damaged, and they grow and divide uncontrollably. Since the cell cycle is no longer regulated, these abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood-forming cells. This leads to a deficiency of normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, which can cause various complications such as infections, anemia, and increased bleeding tendency. There are different types of leukemia, classified based on the types of blood cells affected and the rate of progression. Some of the common types include: 1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in children. 2. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; can occur in both children and adults. 3. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in adults over the age of 55. 4. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; usually diagnosed in adults.

The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the \\"14 Words\\" slogan: \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\\" The second is 88, which stands for \\"Heil Hitler\\" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net. Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for 14.88. The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common.

Outside the museum is a camera and people can come and stand in front of it for as long as they want repeating the words “He will not divide us.” The video will be streamed continuously for four years, or as long as Donald Trump is President. Yesterday, the “He Will Not Divide Us” official Twitter account tweeted out this video of a White Supremacist who showed up and started talking into the camera, including saying, as our cousin site Gossip Cop pointed out, something that sounds like “praise Hitler.” White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down.

Before things got (more) physical, the man left, and the crowd cheered. Other moments have been much more positive. At one point, a man was there by himself for a while. Eventually, a woman came and joined him, saying she had been watching from home and had become inspired. [featured image via Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock, Inc.] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| He Will Not Divide Us/Twitter “He Will Not Divide Us,” the four-year-long anti-Trump participatory art installation from Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Sade Ronkko, and Luke Turner, was the site of a showdown between actor LaBeouf and an unidentified white supremacist on Sunday, Raw Story reports. The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency. The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.) Advertisement LaBeouf, who was there at the time, sensed that a man wearing the uniform of a long-defeated army of racists might not be in the spirit of the thing, and, as can be seen in a video posted to a fan account for the project, successfully shut him down:* White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down.

He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era. Yes, the Nazi looks pathetic, and yes, this is a punch-free Nazi fiasco that we can all enjoy. But a funny web video is a poor consolation for the time—not so long ago!—when fewer Americans thought it was ok to become Nazis to begin with. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans.

The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \\"one mighty in power\\", the one who \\"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations.

Anthurium prefers a coarse, well-draining soil. Try a mixture of equal parts perlite, peat moss, and pine bark.","completion":"Additionally, you can supplement the mixture with a dash of horticultural charcoal and a slow-release fertilizer to optimize nutrient availability and improve overall soil conditions. Once you have prepared the soil mix, follow these steps to ensure successful growth and maintenance of your anthurium plant: 1. Select a suitable container: Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. Ideally, the container should be at least two inches larger in diameter than the plant's root ball, providing ample space for growth. 2. Plant your anthurium: Gently remove the anthurium from its current container, taking care not to damage the roots. Place the plant in the new pot, making sure the top of the root ball is approximately one inch below the pot's rim. Fill in around the roots with your prepared soil mix, and gently press down the soil to remove any air pockets. 3. Water and light requirements: Water your anthurium plant thoroughly after planting. The plant prefers consistently moist soil, but it is crucial to avoid overwatering. Check the top inch of soil regularly and water when it feels slightly dry. Anthuriums thrive in bright, indirect light with temperatures ranging from 65°F to 85°F. Place the pot near a window where it will receive filtered sunlight or growing under fluorescent lights. 4. Humidity and air circulation: Anthurium plants flourish in a humid environment. To increase humidity around your plant, place it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier. Ensure there is proper air circulation to discourage pests and diseases, but avoid placing the plant near drafts, air conditioners, or heating vents. 5. Fertilization: Feed your anthurium every six to eight weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer, diluted to half-strength. Regularly providing nutrients will encourage the growth of vibrant foliage and blooms. 6. Pruning and maintenance: Prune your anthurium by removing dead or damaged leaves and spent flower spikes with a clean, sharp pair of scissors. This will promote new growth and maintain the plant's healthy appearance. Additionally, clean the leaves gently with a damp cloth to remove dust and support photosynthesis. 7. Watch for pests and diseases: Monitor your anthurium plant for common pests, such as aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. Safely manage these issues by using insecticidal soap or neem oil. Keep an eye out for signs of diseases, like root rot or bacterial and fungal infections, and treat promptly to prevent them from spreading. 8. Repotting: As anthurium plants grow, they may become root-bound, which can limit their overall health and growth. Monitor your plant and repot it in a slightly larger container every two to three years, during the spring or summer months, using fresh soil mix. By following these comprehensive guidelines and giving proper attention and care, you'll be well on your way to nurturing a thriving, eye-catching anthurium plant with lush foliage and stunning blooms to enjoy for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Primal Fear Context: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand), the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an...

Answer the question...when did parker brothers make the ouija board??","completion":"Parker Brothers, an American toy and game manufacturer, first began producing the Ouija board in 1966. However, the history of the Ouija board dates back to much earlier than that. The Ouija board, also known as a \\"spirit\\" or \\"talking\\" board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\", and \\"goodbye\\", and sometimes other symbols or graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is believed to move across the board to spell out words or answer questions posed by the users. The mysterious movement of the planchette has often been attributed to supernatural forces or spirit communications. The concept of the Ouija board can be traced back to mid-19th century spiritualism, particularly in the United States. In the era of the Civil War, the spiritualist movement gained popularity as people sought to communicate with deceased loved ones. The precursors to the Ouija board included various devices used for automatic writing, such as planchettes with pencils attached to the tips and the dial plate, which used a spinning dial instead of a planchette. In 1890, a patent was granted to Elijah Bond, Charles Kennard, and William H. A. Maupin for a talking board on which the Ouija name was first introduced. The name \\"Ouija\\" has been claimed to be a combination of the French word \\"oui\\" and the German word \\"ja\\", both meaning \\"yes\\". However, it has also been suggested that the name came through the board itself during a session that involved the sister-in-law of Elijah Bond, who identified the board as Ouija and declared that it meant \\"good luck\\" in ancient Egyptian. The board was initially produced and marketed by the Kennard Novelty Company, and, following the company's dissolution in 1898, production and distribution of the Ouija board was taken over by William Fuld. He marketed the board under the brand name Ouija and continued to produce and sell the Ouija board until his death in 1927. After Fuld's death, his heirs continued to manufacture and market Ouija boards under the name William Fuld Talking Board Set. Finally, in 1966, the Fuld family sold the manufacturing and marketing rights for Ouija boards to Parker Brothers, the company that popularized the board game Monopoly. Parker Brothers produced and marketed Ouija boards as a family game and maintained ownership until 1991, when they were acquired by Hasbro Inc., which currently owns the rights to the Ouija board/trademark and continues to manufacture it under the same specifications and designs introduced by Parker Brothers. In summary, while the Ouija board's origins can be traced back to the mid-19th century spiritualist movement, it wasn't until 1966 that Parker Brothers began producing the well-known and widely-used version of the board that we are familiar with today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Goals should be set because they provide several important functions in achieving desired outcomes and personal growth. Here is a detailed explanation of the various reasons why setting goals is essential: 1. Direction and Focus: Goals help to provide direction and purpose in our lives. When we set goals, we are creating an action plan that guides us towards a specific objective. This direction gives our actions a clear purpose and allows us to maintain focus, ensuring that our efforts are aligned with our overall vision. 2. Motivation: Setting goals acts as a powerful motivator, as it helps us identify what is truly important to us and provides a sense of accomplishment once we achieve them. This motivation fuels our efforts and increases our perseverance, driving us to overcome obstacles and challenges that may arise along the way. 3. Measurable Progress: One of the significant advantages of setting goals is the ability to measure progress. By breaking the ultimate goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, we can track our achievements over specific periods (daily, weekly, monthly), allowing us to evaluate our progress, celebrate milestones, and adjust our approach if necessary. 4. Time Management and Efficiency: Goal setting helps to enhance time management and improve efficiency in our daily lives. When we have clear objectives, we can prioritize tasks effectively, allocate time and resources wisely, and set realistic deadlines for ourselves. This enables us to make the most of our time, maintain focus on the task at hand and avoid distractions. 5. Personal Growth and Development: Goals play a crucial role in promoting personal growth and development. When we set and pursue goals, we step out of our comfort zones, develop new skills, become more resilient, and discover our inner strengths. This process of self-improvement and self-discovery fosters self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-esteem. 6. Satisfaction and Sense of Achievement: Achieving goals provides a deep sense of satisfaction, accomplishment, and fulfillment. This feeling of success can improve our overall sense of well-being, happiness, and quality of life, further motivating us to continue setting and achieving new goals. In summary, setting goals is essential because it provides us with direction, focus, motivation, a tool for evaluating progress, improved time management and efficiency, personal growth and development, and a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Goals enable us to make constructive choices, remain persistent in challenging situations, and stay focused on our ultimate targets, ensuring long-term success in our personal and professional lives."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A famished Wile E. Coyote, (Eatibus Anythingus), trudges across the floor of the desert, catching anything that he can find, from a fly to an empty tin can, with the intention of eating it. Suddenly, he is flattened by the Road Runner, (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile recovers, blinks his eyes, and has a vision of a wonderful Road Runner feast. He then ditches the tin can and chases after the Road Runner, adopting a low stance to reduce his drag which allows him to close in on the Road Runner, but the bird finds another gear and rockets away, leaving the coyote's eyes to pop out of his sockets. Dejected, he plans his next scheme.Wile sets up a pulley, rope and rock trap to try smashing the passing Road Runner, hoping its extra complexity will stop Wile from being squashed, but the rock finds a way to squash the coyote as the Road Runner stops to mock him.A furious Wile arms himself with a lasso as he waits for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso before the bird can get there, and drags Wile across the hard ground. As the coyote paces off the road, we see that the friction has left Wile with a bare rear end.Wile then uses a How-To book to build a Burmese tiger trap. He digs a square pit in the road and fills it with a sheet camouflaged as a road.

He dives into the pit to capture his prey, but instantly re-emerges and flees in terror when an animal stealthily climbs out of the trap. The animal is subsequently identified as a Burmese Tiger (Surprisibus!

Information: - Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia. The name \\"Melbourne\\" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians. - The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \\"bracelets\\". During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. - A poker tournament is a tournament where players compete by playing poker. It can feature as few as two players playing on a single table (called a \\"heads-up\\" tournament), and as many as tens of thousands of players playing on thousands of tables. The winner of the tournament is usually the person who wins every poker chip in the game and the others are awarded places based on the time of their elimination. To facilitate this, in most tournaments, blinds rise over the duration of the tournament. Unlike in a ring game (or cash game), a player's chips in a tournament cannot be cashed out for money and serve only to determine the player's placing. - The World Poker Tour (WPT) is a series of international poker tournaments and associated television series broadcasting the final table of each tournament. It was started in 2002 in the United States by attorney/television producer Steven Lipscomb, who served as CEO of WPT Enterprises (WPTE), the firm that controlled the World Poker Tour up to November 2009. In 2008, the WPT started offering bracelets to its event champions. Players who won a title prior to the release of the WPT Bracelet were given one retroactively. - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. - The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside of Las Vegas. From its inception to the 2013 tournament, players from 19 countries USA (10), France (4), UK (3), Denmark (3), Canada (2), Norway (2), Portugal (2), Italy (2), Afghanistan, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Tunisia, Switzerland, Australia, Italy and Finland have won bracelets. - Jason Warner ( born c. 1985 ) is a Canadian hardware store worker who won a World Series of Poker bracelet in the 2007 1,500 No - Limit Hold'em short handed . Warner does not like playing poker online , preferring to play at the River Rock Casino near Vancouver .

In early December, Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, respectively the leaders of the two parts of Cyprus, startled Cypriots by announcing that they would meet for the first time in four years. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? A cypriot is someone from Cyprus.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" does indeed follow the initial statement, as it provides a definition that helps clarify the nationality of the people mentioned, Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, as well as the citizens affected by their decisions. The initial statement sets the context by explaining a significant event occurring in Cyprus and includes figures of high relevance for their nation. Specifically, it references Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, who lead different political factions in Cyprus. Their plan to meet after four years of having no such dialogues might have a significant impact on the Cypriot political landscape and comes as a shock to their citizens, referred to here as \\"Cypriots.\\" The following sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" is a general statement that denotes who Cypriots are. This concise definition can be especially helpful for those not familiar with the term, offering valuable context and understanding to the audience. It helps to establish the nationality of not just Clerides and Denktash but also of the people likely to be most directly affected by their planned meeting and subsequent decisions. Although the second sentence is not directly linked to the narrative of the first, it aids reader understanding by defining what it means to be a Cypriot, which is implied to be of notable relevance, given the circumstances discussed in the initial text. The juxtaposition of a significant political event that impacts Cypriots with the simple definition of \\"Cypriot\\" underscores the nationwide implications this meeting could potentially have for people from Cyprus. So, in summary, while the second sentence does not advance the narrative of the first, it does serve to clarify terminology that is vital to understanding the gravity of the initially referenced event. Therefore, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" indeed follows the preceding text and enhances the reader's comprehension. However, it would be better placed at the start or woven into the initial text to offer a smoother contextual flow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The people don't want to treat the infection rather than the sickness, because the","completion":"infection is only a symptom of the underlying issue and it is more crucial to address the root cause, which is the sickness itself. Treating the infection alone may provide temporary relief, but it would not be a long-term solution or contribute to their overall well-being. Ignoring the root cause and only treating the infection might lead to a vicious cycle, as the infection could come back again and again. This may deteriorate the individual's overall health and wellbeing, ultimately causing more harm than good. To break free from this cycle, it is important to focus on treating the sickness. The people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness may stem from the following reasons: 1. Comprehensive approach to healthcare: People have become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing health issues holistically. They realize that understanding and tackling the underlying cause is vital to prevent recurrent infections and promote overall health. 2. Prevention is better than cure: In the long run, treating the sickness before it leads to infections saves both time and resources. By addressing the root cause, people can avoid the potential complications and additional treatments that may arise from recurrent infections. 3. The desire for long-lasting results: Short-term fixes, such as treating the infection without addressing the sickness, are less preferable because they do not guarantee long-lasting results. People may be more inclined to invest their time and effort into understanding and treating the sickness, knowing that this approach will provide more sustainable solutions. 4. Increased knowledge and awareness: The rise of the internet and advancements in medical research have provided people with a wealth of information on various health issues. As a result, they are better informed about the importance of understanding and treating the underlying causes of their health problems, rather than just addressing the symptoms. 5. Widespread advocacy for improved healthcare: Many healthcare professionals, including doctors and public health experts, emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of health problems, rather than just treating the symptoms. This advocacy has significantly influenced public opinion and led to a shift in the approach to healthcare. In conclusion, the people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness stems from their understanding of the importance of addressing the underlying causes of health issues. This shift in perspective echoes the desire for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare, emphasizing the need to not only treat the symptoms but also address the root causes for long-lasting results. As society continues to prioritize prevention and holistic health, treating the sickness over the infection will remain the preferred approach for many."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization. answer the following question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria?

This statement provides specific information about the individual - their gender, the presence of a big backpack, and their path of movement. However, we cannot infer from this information that a man with a big backpack is walking through a grass trail up a hill unless further context or evidence is provided. The two statements refer to different individuals, as one is about a man and the other is about a woman. Consequently, the two scenarios are independent of each other and the first statement does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the second statement.

Question: What does she call the money that she slips under the door to Joe Gargery Movie title: Great Expectations Movie plot: 10-year-old Finnegan \\"Finn\\" Bell is playing on a beach in the Gulf Coast when an escaped convict suddenly pops out of the water and overpowers him, making Finn promise to bring back food, medicine and bolt cutters to get the iron shackles off his leg. Finn complies, and the convict unexpectedly tries to make Finn take him by boat to Mexico. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy, and Finn's boat is towed back to shore. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict, mobster Arthur Lustig, had escaped from death row, but was recaptured and would face execution soon. Finn's uncle Joe Gargery is called to Paradiso Perduto (\\"lost paradise\\"), home of the richest woman in Florida, Mrs. Nora Dinsmoor. She is a local mystery, having shunned virtually all human contact since she was left at the altar several years before. She ostensibly asks him there to do a gardening job, but instead she slips him a large sum of money under the door, calling it \\"gas money\\". Meanwhile, Finn, who he brought along, meets Mrs. Dinsmoor's young niece Estella in the overgrown garden. Mrs. Dinsmoor sees them interacting and calls Maggie (Kim Dickens), Finn's sister, to ask her to let Finn be a playmate for Estella, even though Estella apparently dislikes him. On Finn's first visit, she is disappointed when the boy cannot dance for her, but is intrigued when he says he can draw. She forces Estella to sit for a portrait, which Finn draws with make up on an old piece of wallpaper. While he draws, Mrs. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken. After the portrait session, Mrs. Dinsmoor calls it a day and asks Estella to help Finn find the door. On the way out, she pauses to take a drink from a water fountain and politely offers him a drink from it as well. While Finn is drinking, Estella kisses him. Several years pass.

Once mixed well, add 7-10 drops of peppermint essential oil and 7-10 drops of lavender oil with a dropper. Mix everything together with a spoon, and store in an air-tight jar. To use, pour into a hot bath and relax. Here are the reasons why option B is the better choice: 1. Ingredient choice: In option A, orange soda is used as one of the main ingredients. It contains artificial flavors, sugar, and carbonation, which makes it an inappropriate ingredient for a foot soak. These additives can leave a sticky residue on the skin and be counterproductive to the aim of a soothing foot soak. On the other hand, option B uses bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), which is a natural ingredient, known for its alkalizing and detoxifying properties. It helps in effectively softening and exfoliating the skin, making it more suitable for a foot soak. 2. Purpose of the soak: Option B uses ingredients that contribute to the overall soothing effect of the foot soak. Epsom salts and bicarbonate of soda help in soothing tired muscles, reducing inflammation, and softening the skin. Peppermint and lavender essential oils offer relaxing scents and additional therapeutic benefits. Option A's use of orange soda negates some of these benefits due to the harmful effects of its additives. 3. Ease of use and storage: Both options suggest storing the mixture in an air-tight jar. However, option B's mixture of dry ingredients makes it more suitable for long-term storage, as it won't release carbon dioxide like option A's orange soda would when mixed with the other ingredients. This makes option B a more practical choice as well. In conclusion, option B is the more sensible choice for making a soothing foot soak, due to a better selection of ingredients, alignment with the purpose of the foot soak, and practicality when it comes to storage and use."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Because liquid water is essential to life,the findings could have major implications for the possibility of Martian life.The researchers said further exploration is needed to determine whether microscopic life exists on the planet. The presence of liquid water could also make life easier for astronauts visiting or living on Mars.Water could be used for drinking and for creating oxygen and rocket fuel.NASA's goal is to send humans there in the 2030s. The evidence of flowing water consists largely of dark,narrow streaks on the surface that tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months and fade the rest of the year. Mars is extremely cold even in summer,and the streaks are in places where the temperature is as low as minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit.But salt can lower the freezing point of water and melt ice. The source of the water is a mystery.Scientists noted it could be melting ice.It could be an underground aquifer,which is rock or sand that can hold water.It is possibly water vapor from the thin Martian atmosphere,Or it may be a combination Michael Meyer,lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program,said the only definitive way for now to determine whether there's life on Mars is to collect rocks and soil for analysis on Earth - something a U.S.lander set for lift-off in 2020 will do.

Information: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - Etymology. Rishiri derives its name from the Ainu language, and means \\"high island\\", or \\"island with a high peak\\", a reference to the altitude of Mount Rishiri above sea level. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - History. Hokkaido () was settled by the Ainu, Nivkh, and Orok before recorded history. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and Emishi. One of the places Hirafu went to was called , which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaido. However, many theories exist in relation to the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people. - The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean, lying between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaido to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (the Shantar Sea) along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East. - The Ainu or the Aynu (Ainu \\"Aynu\\"; Japanese: \\"Ainu\\"; Russian: \\"Ajny\\"), in the historical Japanese texts Ezo/Emishi/Ebisu or Ainu, are an indigenous people of Japan (Hokkaido, and formerly northeastern Honshu) and Russia (Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and formerly the Kamchatka Peninsula). - Rebun Island (, \\"Rebun-t\\") is an island in the Sea of Japan off the northwestern tip of Hokkaid, Japan. The island sits off the coast of Hokkaid. Rebun stretches from north to south and from east to west. The island covers approximately . Rebun Island is located northwest of Rishiri Island, and the two islands are separated by the Rebun Channel. - The , also read as Ashihase and Shukushin, were a people of ancient Japan, believed to have lived along the northern portion of the coast of the Sea of Japan. The term Sushen, rendered , is found in Chinese records, but is annotated as Mishihase or Ashihase in Japanese language documents, which should have developed into *\\"Mishiwase\\" or *\\"Ashiwase\\" in Modern Japanese if the word had survived in colloquial speech. - The Sea of Japan (see below for other names) is a marginal sea between the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin, and the Asian mainland. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Japan, North Korea, Russia and South Korea. Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean. This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - The , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan, is the second oldest book of classical Japanese history. The book is also called the . It is more elaborate and detailed than the \\"Kojiki\\", the oldest, and has proven to be an important tool for historians and archaeologists as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\" was finished in 720 under the editorial supervision of Prince Toneri and with the assistance of no Yasumaro dedicated to Empress Gensh. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - Abe no Hirafu might be the ancestor of one or more of the Abe clans, as well as the Ando and Akita clans. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm.

It did work well for trimming prior to shaving, but if you don't let it get to that point, it's unnecessary anyway. I'm not sure who's going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn't trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!! Plus, for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry. Save your money. The trimmer attachment on my husbands electric razor works 10 times better. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is clearly negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the product in several ways throughout the review. Firstly, the title \\"Guess I'm the minority...\\" implies that the reviewer disagrees with the majority of people who may have praised the product. The reviewer further emphasizes their displeasure by stating \\"because I didn't like this at all and it DEFINITELY isn't worth the price!!\\" which highlights their dissatisfaction with both the product's functionality and its cost. One of the major complaints in the review is about the product being \\"too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places,\\" which suggests that the reviewer found the product challenging to use. The reviewer also mentions that the product worked well for one specific purpose (trimming prior to shaving), but they ultimately deem it unnecessary. Another significant criticism in this review can be seen in the statement, \\"I'm not sure who's going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn't trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!!\\" This remark highlights that the reviewer does not believe the product delivers on its promise of providing an adequate trim for bikini usage. The reviewer also criticizes the lack of features for the price they paid, as they mention \\"for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry.\\" This indicates that they find the product to be overpriced for its capabilities and features. Lastly, the reviewer ends the review by suggesting an alternative product, as they mention that \\"the trimmer attachment on my husband's electric razor works 10 times better.\\" This recommendation shows that the reviewer has tried better alternatives and emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the reviewed product. Overall, the tone of this product review is undoubtedly negative, as the reviewer lists multiple complaints, finds the product to be overpriced, and suggests using alternative products instead."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.
