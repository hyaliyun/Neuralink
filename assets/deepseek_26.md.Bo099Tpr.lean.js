You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Sir Arthur John Evans (8 July 1851 - 11 July 1941) was an English archaeologist and pioneer in the study of Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age. He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. Context: Arthur Evans was born in Nash Mills, England, the first child of John Evans (1823-1908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (born 1824), his first cousin, the daughter of John's employer, the inventor and founder of Messrs John Dickinson, a paper mill. John Evans came from a family of men who were both educated and intellectually active; they were nevertheless undistinguished by either wealth or aristocratic connection. John's father, Arthur Benoni Evans, Arthur's grandfather, had been headmaster of Market Bosworth Grammar School. John knew Latin and could quote the classical authors. In 1840, instead of going to college, John started work in the mill owned by his maternal uncle, John Dickinson. He married his cousin, Harriet, in 1850, which entitled him, in 1851, to a junior partnership in the family business. Profits from the mill would eventually help fund Arthur's excavations, restorations at Knossos, and resulting publications. For the time being they were an unpretentious and affectionate family. They moved into a brick row house built for the purpose near the mill, which came to be called the \\"red house\\" because it lacked the sooty patina of the other houses. Harriet called her husband \\"Jack.\\" Grandmother Evans called Arthur \\"darling Trot,\\" asserting in a note that, compared to his father, he was \\"a bit of a dunce.\\" In 1856, with Harriet's declining health and Jack's growing reputation and prosperity, they moved into Harriet's childhood home, a mansion with a garden, where the children ran free. John maintained his status as an officer in the company, which eventually became John Dickinson Stationery, but also became distinguished for his pursuits in numismatics, geology and archaeology. His interest in geology came from an assignment by the company to study the diminishing water resources in the area with a view toward protecting the company from lawsuits. The mill consumed large amounts of water, which was also needed for the canals. He became an expert and a legal consultant. However, collecting was endemic to the family; his father and grandfather both had done it. He was more interested in the stone-age artifacts he was discovering while mapping stream beds. As Arthur grew older, he was allowed to assist John in looking for artifacts and later classifying the collection. Ultimately John became a distinguished antiquary, publishing numerous books and articles. In 1859 he conducted a geological survey of the Somme Valley with Joseph Prestwich. His connections and invaluable advice were indispensable to Arthur's career throughout the remainder of his long life. Arthur's mother, Harriet, died in 1858 when Arthur was seven. He had two brothers, Philip Norman (1854) and Lewis (1853), and two sisters, Alice (1858) and Harriet (1857). He would remain on excellent terms with all of them all of his life. He was raised by a stepmother, Fanny (Frances), nee Phelps, with whom he also got along very well. She had no children of her own and also predeceased her husband. John's third wife was a classical scholar, Maria Millington Lathbury. When he was 70 they had a daughter, Joan, who would become an art historian. John died in 1908 at 85, when Arthur was 57. His close support and assistance had been indispensable in excavating and conceptualizing Minoan civilization. Question: What else occured in his family Answer:","completion":"During the course of Arthur Evans's life, several significant events, transitions, and dynamics characterized the family in which he lived. After Evans's birth in Nash Mills, England, his family consisted of his parents, John Evans (1823-1908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (1824-?), his father's cousin and the daughter of John’s employer. In addition to Evans, his parents had another four children: two brothers, Philip Norman (1854) and Lewis (1853), and two sisters, Alice (1858) and Harriet (1857). Despite the adversity and trials that life exhibited, the family nurtured deep loving relationships, with Evans remaining on cordial terms with his siblings throughout his life. A significant event transpired in 1858 when Harriet, Arthur's mother, tragically passed away when he was just seven. Following Harriet's death, the family dynamics were altered when Fanny (Frances), nee Phelps, became his stepmother. Despite the possibility of tension in such circumstances, Fanny, who had no children of her own, managed to foster a warm relationship with Arthur. However, she predeceased her husband, after which John married for a third time to Maria Millington Lathbury, a classical scholar. John, upon reaching the age of 70, expanded the family by having a daughter with Maria named Joan who later became an art historian. When Arthur was 57, John died at the ripe age of 85. This moment was a critical juncture in the narrative of the family and Arthur's life. John had been a critical source of guidance, support, knowledge, and inspiration for Arthur, making profound contributions to his groundbreaking excavations and pioneering conceptualizations of the Minoan civilization. The household was a scholarly one filled with a variety of intellectual pursuits. Arthur's father, John, held an innate curiosity about the world, as he was interested in numismatics, geology, and archaeology, eventually becoming an esteemed antiquary. Such an enriching environment inevitably shaped and encouraged Arthur's pursuits in the same realm. To sum up, Arthur Evans's family experienced various transformations due to births, deaths, and marriages. These changes in family structure significantly influenced Evans's upbringing and later career. The intellectual atmosphere in the family nurtured Arthur's love for archaeology and contributed to his remarkable discoveries in the field, impacting the course of archaeology and his studies on Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the sentiment: I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT. Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in. Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze the provided text in terms of positive and negative aspects, as well as the overall tone. 1. The review starts with the user expressing excitement and anticipation for the movie due to the positive attention it received. - This indicates a positive sentiment at the beginning. 2. The review continues by saying that the first quarter of the movie was good, and praises the portrayal of the black music scene. - This supports a positive sentiment. 3. However, the user goes on to mention that the movie became boring for the entire family as it went on, with too much focus on the singing. - This indicates a transition to a negative sentiment. 4. The review highlights the lack of character development and the inability to care for the characters. - This reinforces the negative sentiment. 5. The conflict in the movie is deemed insignificant, further emphasizing the viewer's lack of engagement. - This supports the overall negative sentiment. 6. The movie is compared to \\"Ray,\\" \\"Chicago,\\" and \\"Rent,\\" with only the latter two being considered exceptional by the user. - This suggests a somewhat mixed sentiment, given the partial comparison to favorable movies. 7. The review concludes that the movie might suit someone who enjoys singing performances without caring much about an overall story. - This implies a slightly positive sentiment for a specific target audience. Taking all these points into consideration, the overall sentiment of this review leans towards negative. The user expresses disappointment in the movie, particularly regarding the boredom, lack of character development, and weak conflict.

Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London? is inside the article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of person who in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"? By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his...

Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Please answer this question : Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","completion":"Crop B would need more number of chemicals, as it is not tolerant of herbicides. Crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, which allows it to grow while the herbicides kill the weeds.

Here is a premise: \\"The boy in blue has the ball, and the boy in white is airborne.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The boys are alive\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise provided is: \\"The boy in blue has the ball, and the boy in white is airborne.\\" This premise offers a description of a specific moment and details about two boys engaged in an activity. Based on this premise, we can draw on a general understanding that describes a situation involving the boys, the clothes they are wearing, and their actions. The hypothesis given is: \\"The boys are alive.\\" The hypothesis makes a general claim about the existence and state of life of the two boys mentioned in the premise. In order to evaluate whether the premise supports the hypothesis, it is essential to identify and analyze relevant information contributing to the inference or potential support for the hypothesis. The premise consists of two parts: 1. The boy in blue has the ball. 2. The boy in white is airborne. Let's analyze both these parts: 1. The boy in blue has the ball: This statement tells us that one of the boys wears blue clothing and is currently holding or interacting with a ball. It is reasonable to assume that engaging in such an activity often requires someone to be alive, as having the ball denotes intentional actions like holding, catching, or controlling the ball. 2. The boy in white is airborne: This statement tells us that the other boy is wearing white clothing and is in a state of being off the ground or mid-air. Being airborne suggests activities like jumping, running, or performing other physical or sports-related actions. Again, it is reasonable to presume that engaging in these activities requires someone to be alive. The ability to perform these actions suggests that the body is functional and capable of voluntary movement. Both statements provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that the boys are alive. While the premise does not explicitly tell us whether the hypothesis is true, it does carry contextual information that indicates that the two boys are capable of performing specific actions (holding a ball and being airborne) which are generally associated with the state of being alive. Therefore, based on the elements described in the premise and an understanding of the abilities or behavior that these elements suggest, we can reasonably deduce that the hypothesis \\"The boys are alive\\" is supported by the premise, even though it doesn't explicitly say so."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the rank of the man accused of attacking the widow? Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment. One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns. One officer knows who the culprit is and, hiding Drake in the shadows so he may witness what is to take place, confronts the guilty man privately in the final scene.

The realization that her fitness journey had not only benefitted her but also inspired others made her feel even more motivated and determined to continue pushing herself to new heights. As the conversation continued, Christine eagerly inquired about the specific routines, dietary changes, and lifestyle adjustments that Carrie had adopted in her pursuit of a toned and sculpted physique. Carrie gladly shared her experiences, discussing the grueling early morning workouts, the strict adherence to a balanced and nutrient-dense meal plan, and the importance of maintaining a positive mindset amid inevitable setbacks and challenges. Christine listened attentively, taking mental notes as she began envisioning how she might apply some of Carrie's proven techniques in her own quest for self-improvement. Noticing Christine's interest, Carrie offered to accompany her friend to the gym and guide her through a custom workout plan, which Christine enthusiastically accepted, excited by the prospect of having a reliable and supportive workout partner. The two friends approached their shared fitness journey with gusto, finding that the bond of camaraderie and mutual encouragement greatly enhanced their motivation and commitment to achieving their goals.

Article: More than 1300 men and women from five countries were asked to colour in areas of the human body that they would allow particular people to touch, from their partner to a stranger and to say for which purposes they would allow touch. The answers were combined to create maps that show how touchable areas of the body are for particular relationships (eg partner, uncle, acquaintance) and also which areas are taboo. Some results are unsurprising. For example, the maps confirm that women are uncomfortable with being touched by male strangers on most of their body, while men do not want relatives of either gender to touch their genitals. British people are less comfortable with touching than people from the other countries sampled (Finland, France, Italy and Russia). In general, regardless of nationality, the closer the relationship, the greater the area that can be touched. ‘The results indicate that touching is an important means of maintaining social relationships. The touch space map is closely associated with the pleasure caused by touching. The greater the pleasure caused by touching a specific area of the body, the more selectively we allow others to touch it,’ says researcher Juulia Suvilehto from Aalto University. Other results were less expected. Italians were less comfortable with being touched than Russians, while overall Finns were the most comfortable with being touched. Also, our willingness to be touched does not fade over time. We also interpret touch depending on the context of the relationship Professor Robin Dunbar, Department of Experimental Psychology Oxford University’s Professor Robin Dunbar said: ‘It is the relationship rather than familiarity that matters. A friend we haven’t seen for some time will still be able to touch areas where an acquaintance we see every day would not. ‘We also interpret touch depending on the context of the relationship – we may perceive a touch in a particular place from a relative or friend as a comforting gesture, while the same touch from a partner might be more pleasurable, and from a stranger it would be entirely unwelcome. ‘Touch is universal. While culture does modulate how we experience it, generally we all respond to touching in the same ways. Even in an era of mobile communications and social media, touch is still important for establishing and maintaining the bonds between people.’ ||||| Where Men And Women Liked To Be Touched Trending News: The Beginner's Guide To Touching People Why Is This Important? Because everyone has their personal bubble. Long Story Short Researchers at Oxford University polled over 1,300 men and women to ask them a simple question: Who do you allow to touch you, and where? The results, while not entirely unexpected, reveal some surprising quirks. Long Story When we think about touching, we usually think about it in black and white terms: There are people we’re ok with touching us, and people we aren’t. But in reality, it goes much deeper than that. To find out how much deeper, researchers from Oxford University surveyed over 1,300 men and women from five different countries to determine whom people allow to touch them, and where they’re comfortable being touched. Oxford University/Aalto University What you’re looking at is the aggregated data in graphical form of where people are comfortable being touched, based on their relationships. The lighter areas show where people are comfortable, while darker areas signal discomfort. The black areas outlined in blue are “off-limits” zones, where they’re absolutely not comfortable being touched by that particular person. Overall, the results are not that surprising. People are perfectly fine being touched almost anywhere by romantic partners, and not comfortable being touched at all, really, by strangers. It gets weirder the longer you stare at it, though. For instance, people are uniformly less comfortable being touched in the pelvis area by males of any relationship, which isn’t surprising — no one wants their uncle’s hands on their junk, whether you’re a guy or a girl. But then, oddly, everyone seems to be less comfortable with men touching them specifically below the knees. Here’s the same graphic, broken out by gender: Oxford University/Aalto University Now, we see a little more continuity. Women apparently have no issues with having their sisters, mothers and friends (of both genders!) all up in their crotch business, but men are only (hilariously) somewhat ok with being touched in the wang region by female friends, acquaintances and strangers — it would appear that as long as there’s no law or social convention preventing us from schtupping a lady, we’ll tolerate her handling our packages. Women are less protective of their butts than men are, and will also tolerate touching in the chest region until we get down to the uncle. If you’re a very strange sort of guy who’s ever wondered whether or not your sister would let you grab her boobs, the answer may surprise you! Other tidbits the researchers discovered include that people from Finland are the most comfortable being touched overall, while Brits are the least comfortable. Women, generally speaking, are more receptive to touch than men across all relationships. If any of this is surprising to you, then you probably have people in your life who wish you would stop touching them.

Drop This Fact Tolerance for touching doesn’t appear to change: You’re more likely to be open to touching by a close friend you haven’t seen in years than an acquaintance you see every day. |||||Summary:","completion":"Researchers from Oxford University and Aalto University conducted a study involving more than 1,300 participants from Finland, France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom to determine personal boundaries when it comes to touching and human relationships. Women were generally found to be more receptive to touch, while British individuals appeared to be less comfortable compared to other nationalities in the study. The researchers concluded that touch remains an important factor in establishing and maintaining close connections among people, even in the age of social media and mobile communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he examines it, he realizes it's a rare, antique rifle. Mystified, he cleans it and stumbles upon an inscription that reads, \\"The bearer of this rifle shall unlock unimaginable power.\\" This discovery leads him on a journey to uncover the truth about his family history and the origins of this enigmatic weapon. Delving into long-forgotten archives and family mementos, Harry unearths a shocking secret: an ancient order of skilled assassins known as \\"The Sentinels\\" once defended the realm from the shadows, and his ancestors were members of this elite brotherhood. The heirloom - the \\"Rifle of Destiny\\" - had been passed down through the generations, its true potential yet to be unleashed. Intrigued, yet skeptical, Harry ultimately learns of a prophecy stating that the rifle's owner shall have the power to face and vanquish a rising dark force that threatens the world once every century. The dreaded day arrives when the dark force, a malevolent cult known as \\"The Cabal,\\" emerges once again. Terror sweeps across the city as chaos reigns, and Harry is thrust into the fray.

[ii] Forgetting to wash hair would not explain the presence of blood, the bloodshot eye, or the yellowish splotch around the other eye.

The text describes the person's hair as stringy and clumped with blood, as well as having a bloodshot eye and a yellowish splotch around the other eye.

A check is a condition in chess, shogi, and xiangqi that occurs when a player's king (or general in xiangqi) is under threat of capture on their opponent's next turn. A king so threatened is said to be in check. A player must get out of check, if possible, by interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king, capturing the threatening piece, or moving the king to a square where it is no longer in check. If the player cannot move out of check, the game ends in checkmate and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check. can a king take a piece to get out of check?","completion":"Yes, a king can take a piece to get out of check, but only if it's safe to do so. Imagine the king is playing a game of tag, and someone is trying to tag him.

The trip turned into a year-long travel. What's more, he even found his Miss Right and got married by the end of the story.

Holmes (Cook) has just restored a stolen artifact to three French nuns, and is later called on a case by Dr. Mortimer (Terry-Thomas) concerning Sir Henry Baskerville (Kenneth Williams) and a legendary hound that curses the Baskerville estate. Tired and worn out by so many cases, Holmes passes the case onto Dr. Watson (Moore), who is portrayed as a Welsh eccentric. Upon arriving at the station, Sir Henry, Dr. Mortimer, Watson and Perkins (their driver) are halted by a policeman (Spike Milligan), who warns them of a murderer stalking the moors, before sending the group on their way. While out in the moor collecting specimens, Watson has a curious encounter in a hut with the raving Mr. Frankland (Hugh Griffith) and Frankland's exceedingly strong daughter, Mary (Dana Gillespie ). In the next scene, we see Holmes still in London, visiting Ada, his mother (also played by Dudley Moore), who, as a bogus spiritualist aided by her housekeeper, Iris, scams older ladies of their money in false seances. Holmes' mother is concerned that \\"Watty\\" (Watson) may need help, and that \\"Sherl\\" (as she calls her son), should rush to his aid.

Answer:","completion":"Peter Sellers married Swedish actress Britt Ekland in 1964. Born Richard Henry Sellers on September 8, 1925, in Southsea, Hampshire, England, Peter Sellers was a highly versatile and influential British actor and comedian. He is best remembered for his roles in the British film series 'The Pink Panther' as the iconic Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Throughout his career, he appeared in numerous films, displaying his ability to slip seamlessly into different characters, each with a distinctly unique persona. In contrast, Britt Ekland was born Britt-Marie Eklund on October 6, 1942, in Stockholm, Sweden. She developed a career as an actress, singer, and model, making her mark in both European and American films. Ekland gained international recognition in the 1960s and 1970s, starring in popular films such as 'The Night They Raided Minsky's' (1968), 'Get Carter' (1971), and as a Bond girl named Mary Goodnight in the James Bond film 'The Man with the Golden Gun' (1974). The couple first met in early 1964 at a dinner party held by Peter's agent, Dennis Selinger. Sellers and Ekland quickly became smitten with each other, and after only a short ten-day courtship, they were married. The wedding took place on February 19, 1964, at a small ceremony in Guildford, Surrey, England. The marriage garnered a great deal of media attention at the time due to their status as high-profile celebrities. Despite the lavish and high-profile lifestyle they shared, their marriage was often marked by turbulence, with a fair share of ups and downs. Sellers and Ekland had one child together, a daughter named Victoria, who was born on January 20, 1965. However, their marriage eventually came to an end, and the couple divorced in December 1968. Throughout his life, Peter Sellers was married four times in total, including his marriage to Ekland. His first wife was Anne Levy, whom he married in 1951 and divorced in 1961. After his marriage to Ekland, he went on to marry Miranda Quarry in 1970, but their marriage also ended in divorce in 1974. His final marriage was to Lynne Frederick in 1977, who remained his wife until Sellers' untimely death on July 24, 1980. Britt Ekland, on the other hand, had three marriages in total. Prior to marrying Sellers, she was married to Peter Hall from 1960 to 1962. After her marriage to Sellers, she later married Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom in 1984, but they also divorced in 1992."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Autolux and Polvo are both types of what? A:","completion":"Autolux and Polvo are both types of alternative rock bands that have made significant contributions to the music landscape, particularly in the genres of indie rock, experimental rock, and noise rock. These bands share some similarities regarding their musical styles and influences but are also quite distinct in terms of their origins, members, discography, and overall impact on the alternative rock scene. Autolux is an American alternative rock band originating from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2000. The band consists of members Eugene Goreshter (vocals/bass), Carla Azar (vocals/drums), and Greg Edwards (vocals/guitar). Autolux's music is characterized by its blending of ethereal melodies, ambient soundscapes, and fuzz-laden guitar work. They incorporate elements of shoegaze, post-rock, and electronic music in their distinctive sound. Their debut studio album \\"Future Perfect\\" (2004), produced by notable producer T-Bone Burnett, was well-received by critics and garnered a dedicated fan following. The album showcased the band's ability to juxtapose melodic tracks with more experimental noise rock offerings. They went on to release two more studio albums, \\"Transit Transit\\" (2010) and \\"Pussy's Dead\\" (2016), continuing to evolve and experiment with their music, gaining praise and recognition for their unique contribution to the alternative rock genre. Polvo is an influential American indie rock band formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1990. The band was initially composed of Ash Bowie (vocals/guitar), Dave Brylawski (guitar/vocals), Steve Popson (bass), and Eddie Watkins (drums). Polvo's music is primarily known for its complex guitar interplay, irregular time signatures, and unorthodox song structures, placing them within the realm of math rock and noise rock. Throughout their career, Polvo has released a number of well-regarded albums that have served as significant influences on fellow musicians and the alternative rock scene as a whole. Their debut album \\"Cor-Crane Secret\\" (1992) along with other notable releases such as \\"Today's Active Lifestyles\\" (1993), \\"Celebrate the New Dark Age\\" (1994), and \\"Exploded Drawing\\" (1996) demonstrated their adventurous and innovative approach to music, resonating with fans and critics alike. However, the band went on an extended hiatus after releasing \\"Shapes\\" (1997), eventually reuniting in 2008 and released \\"In Prism\\" (2009) and \\"Siberia\\" (2013). In conclusion, Autolux and Polvo are both types of alternative rock bands that have had a lasting impact on the indie rock, experimental rock, and noise rock genres. Despite their different origins and musical trajectories, both bands have been praised for their ingenuity, innovation, and the distinctive styles they brought to the alternative rock landscape. Autolux's atmospheric, shoegaze-tinged sound contrasts with Polvo's more angular, math-rock approach, but both bands share a common dedication to pushing creative boundaries in their respective corners of the music world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Danish and US researchers say warmer air and sea surface could lead to record lows of sea ice at north pole next year The Arctic is experiencing extraordinarily hot sea surface and air temperatures, which are stopping ice forming and could lead to record lows of sea ice at the north pole next year, according to scientists. Danish and US researchers monitoring satellites and Arctic weather stations are surprised and alarmed by air temperatures peaking at what they say is an unheard-of 20C higher than normal for the time of year. In addition, sea temperatures averaging nearly 4C higher than usual in October and November. “It’s been about 20C warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean, along with cold anomalies of about the same magnitude over north-central Asia. This is unprecedented for November,” said research professor Jennifer Francis of Rutgers university. Temperatures have been only a few degrees above freezing when -25C should be expected, according to Francis. “These temperatures are literally off the charts for where they should be at this time of year. It is pretty shocking. The Arctic has been breaking records all year. It is exciting but also scary,” she said. Francis said the near-record low sea ice extent this summer had led to a warmer than usual autumn. That in turn had reduced the temperature difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes. “This helped make the jet stream wavier and allowed more heat and moisture to be driven into Arctic latitudes and perpetuate the warmth. It’s a vicious circle,” she added. Sea ice, which forms and melts each year, has declined more than 30% in the past 25 years. This week it has been at the lowest extent ever recorded for late November. According to the US government’s National Snow and Ice Data Centre, (NSIDC), around 2m square kilometres less ice has formed since September than average. The level is far below the same period in 2012, when sea ice went on to record its lowest ever annual level. Francis said she was convinced that the cause of the high temperatures and ice loss was climate change. “It’s all expected. There is nothing but climate change that can cause these trends. This is all headed in the same direction and picking up speed.” Rasmus Tonboe, a sea ice remote sensing expert at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, said: “Sea surface temperatures in the Kara and Barents seas are much warmer than usual. That makes it very difficult for sea ice to freeze. Record-breaking temperatures 'have robbed the Arctic of its winter' Read more “When we have large areas of open water, it also raises air temperatures, and it has been up to 10/15C warmer. Six months ago the sea ice was breaking up unusually early. This made more open water and allowed the sunlight to be absorbed, which is why the Arctic is warmer this year,” he said. “What we are seeing is both surprising and alarming. This is faster than the models. It is alarming because it has consequences.” Julienne Stroeve, the professor of polar observation at University College London said ice that should be growing at this time of year was retreating. “It’s been a crazy year. There is no ice at Svalbard yet. In the last few days there has been a decline in sea ice in the Bering sea. Very warm air has flooded into the Arctic from the south, pressing the ice northwards. “Air temperature drives the formation of the ice. It has been really delayed this year so the ice is also much thinner than it usually is. The speed at which this is happening surprises me. In the Arctic the trend has been clear for years, but the speed at which it is happening is faster than anyone thought,” said Strove. “Ice is very sensitive to weather. There is a huge high pressure over the Kara sea, and Eurasia and Canada. We are seeing very strong winds bringing warm air north.” The significance of the ice forming late is that this affects its growth the following year, with consequences for climate. “Extreme wind and high air temperatures [now],” she said, “could see ice extent drop next year below the record 2012 year”. She added: “The ice could be even thinner than it was at the start of 2012. This is definitely a strange year.” Ed Blockley, the lead scientist of the UK Met Office’s polar climate group, said: “The sea ice is extremely low. It is freezing but very slowly. Last week the Barents sea reduced its ice cover. There was less ice at the end than the start. “These temperature anomalies are not unprecedented but this is certainly extraordinary. We are seeing a continual decline in ice. It it likely to be a hiccup but it puts us in bad starting position for next year.” ||||| November started out pretty normal for the Arctic. The sun had set for the season, temperatures were dropping, ice was growing rapidly. Winter was coming, right on schedule. And then, a few days ago, everything came screeching to a halt. Ice stopped forming. And then it actually started to melt, thanks to a sudden heat wave that blistered the region with temperatures 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average. For now, the mass of warm air doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. That’s bad news for sea ice. Coverage in the Arctic was already at its lowest levels since researchers began using satellite data to measure it back in 1978. And as of November 19, Arctic sea ice was nearly 350,000 square miles below its extent in 2012, the last record-low year. The extreme weather has scientists scrambling to figure out what’s causing the historical temperatures, and more importantly, what their long-term impacts could be. Climate Change Institute/University of Maine “It’s absurdly warm over the Arctic Ocean right now and the question is, where the heck is all that heat in the ocean coming from?,” says Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, CO. “No one has a real handle on that yet.” There are a few likely explanations. At this time of year, without the sun’s rays, the ocean begins to lose its heat in the form of infrared radiation. On its way to outer space, the radiation has to pass through the atmosphere, and water vapor and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap and absorb some of that radiation, heating up in the process. That’s all pretty normal. But this year, atmospheric circulation patterns are bringing more warmth to the Arctic than usual. Last month, an unusually high pressure system centered over Scandinavia brought in a flow of warm southerly air between Greenland and Norway. At the same time, in the Pacific, an abnormally low pressure system formed just east of Russia, along the Kamchatka Peninsula. That drew in warm heat from the mainland up toward Alaska and the Bering Sea. With their powers combined, they blasted the Arctic with a heavy, sweaty dose of hot air. This wouldn’t be such a big deal on its own, but warmer and more humid air increases the greenhouse effect. It becomes more and more difficult for the ocean to transmit heat away from its surface, and more and more difficult for ice to form. Which is one explanation for why Arctic sea ice cover continues to run at record low levels this late into the year. The effects are being felt far below the 66th parallel. States in the Upper Midwest experienced their warmest falls ever, with temperatures running about 15 degrees warmer than average through the second week of November. Minnesota experienced the longest growing season ever recorded: 220 days. And the Twin Cities set a record for the latest frost in history. On his weather nerd cult blog the Updraft, Minnesota Public Radio chief meteorologist Paul Huttner said that the Arctic “was broken.” Normally, northwest winds blow down from the Arctic over snow-covered ground and iced-over lakes before reaching the US. But this year bare ground all the way up the Arctic circle allowed the sun to warm the upstream air mass more efficiently (no snow means no albedo effect). “The Arctic is North America’s refrigerator,” Huttner says. “If it stops getting as cold as it should, the effects are felt far and wide. I always say that the Arctic is no Las Vegas. Whatever happens in the Arctic, doesn’t stay in the Arctic.” Which is why climate scientists are gathering data points to try to understand what this anomaly means for the future. It’s too soon to tell if the extreme temperatures are part of a pattern or just an outlier, Serreze says. But if there’s one thing history teaches us, it’s that the Arctic is not as resilient as it once was. Thick layers of old sea ice are the Arctic’s buffer against rare weather events—and that kind of ice has been rapidly disappearing. In the 1980s, multiyear ice made up 20 percent of sea ice cover; today, it’s only 3 percent. As those numbers decline, the Arctic becomes more vulnerable to wide temperature fluctuations. “Had that same pattern set up in 1980, the sea ice could have taken the punch,” say Serreze. “Now it can’t. And what we’ve learned is that the response of the ice to these extreme events is changing, and with it so are the odds. It loads the dice.” Dear Arctic, may the odds be ever in your favor. ||||| NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio It’s an internet sensation. An alarming graph showing the global area of sea ice falling to unprecedented lows for this time of year has gone viral. The graph adds together the area of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic to show the global total. Wipneus Advertisement It was compiled by a contributor to the Arctic Sea Ice blog called Wipneus, rather than an official source, but it is accurate. The latest version can be found here. One scientist suggested the trend was due to a sensor error, but this is not the case. So, should we be worried? Here’s what you need to know. This is a weather event, not a climate event What’s happening in the Arctic would be impossible without a century of global warming causing a long-term decline in sea ice levels — but it is actually a short-term weather event. At this time of year, sea ice should be growing rapidly as winter sets in. But the cold air that usually sits over the pole has flowed south over Siberia, while warmer air has flowed north. This has resulted in temperatures an astonishing 20 °C warmer than usual, so sea ice is melting when it should be forming. Here’s what the temperature anomaly looks plotted out via Zack Labe of Cornell University: Today’s latest #Arctic mean temperature continues to move the wrong direction… up. Quite an anomalous spike! pic.twitter.com/C93cQWUKV9 — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) November 15, 2016 In fact, it’s two weather events On the other side of the planet, the sea ice around Antarctica is falling during the southern summer. The sea ice reached its maximum winter extent unusually early this year and has been falling fast, to a new record low for this time of year (see graph below). Antarctic sea ice is pretty much at an all time low for this time of year. pic.twitter.com/oqTdTpPCrr — Eric Steig (@ericsteig) November 21, 2016 So, sea ice levels at both poles are much lower than the seasonal average. Antarctic sea ice levels have actually been increasing slightly over the past three decades, so this low is unusual. The increase could be due to a combination of stronger winds spreading out the sea ice and fresh water from melting ice on land diluting seawater so it freezes at higher temperatures. Global warming may be making freak weather events in the Arctic more likely All weather events are influenced by climate change as they now take place in a world more than 1 °C warmer than a century ago. There is growing evidence that the crazy weather we’re seeing in the Arctic and surrounding regions is made far more likely by climate change. Normally, cold air is kept locked up in the Arctic by a spinning vortex of air bounded by fast winds high in the atmosphere called the jet stream. Now, more and more often, the jet stream seems to weaken and allow cold Arctic air to flow south, with warm air flowing north to replace it. This odd jet stream behaviour could be to blame for many of the freakishly cold weather events in recent years as well as current events. Yes, we should be worried What’s happening now is alarming, but it’s not the short-term craziness we should be worrying about. The reason to be alarmed is that this kind of event can happen only because the planet is so much warmer than in pre-industrial times. Sea ice in the Arctic might fall to a record low next year, but it is likely to then briefly “recover” for a few years before falling to new record lows. How do we know? Because there are negative and positive feedback effects at work. For instance, open water exposed by the loss of sea ice soaks up more of the sun’s heat during summer, but it also loses much more heat in autumn. What will happen to the sea ice in Antarctica over the next few years is less clear. We don’t have a good understanding of what’s going on there, largely because we don’t have good data. We have no idea how thick the sea ice around Antarctica is, for instance. In the long term, however, Antarctic sea ice is expected to decline too. The loss of sea ice does not directly raise global sea levels, but it is already affecting us all through its effects on the weather. As the planet continues to warm we are going to see even more freakish weather. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Arctic Ocean is experiencing air temperatures that are 20C higher than normal and sea temperatures that are 4C higher than average, meaning ice is not forming at the usual rate and could lead to record lows of polar ice next year, warn scientists from the US and Denmark.

Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season.

The turning point in \\"The Matador\\" comes about half through the movie when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's Julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. But did he really? Richard Shephard, the director of \\"The Matador\\", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living. Danny, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian. It's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer. Philip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments. Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material. The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything. Choose your answer.

Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger. Why should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more. Animals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly. Luckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger. Quite a few countries have passed laws.

A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bankâs board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that heâs in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \\"Snaps's daughter.\\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa. Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the worldâs great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \\"Snaps's daughter\\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military. Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature.

The complete sentence would be: \\"The shirt matched her shoes, but did not go with her socks, as the shoes were a matching color to it.\\" In this sentence, the subject is the shirt, which is being compared to both the shoes and the socks. The sentence emphasizes that the shirt matched the shoes, establishing a harmonious connection between these clothing items. However, the same cannot be said about the relationship between the shirt and the socks, as the socks do not share the same matching color with the shirt. Consequently, there is a contrast between the visual compatibility of the shirt with the shoes as opposed to the socks. The sentence structure effectively communicates this contrast by first establishing the positive relationship between the shirt and the shoes and then immediately negating it in reference to the socks. By using option a) to end the sentence, the focus remains on the matching quality of the shirt and the shoes, while simultaneously emphasizing the discordant aspect of the shirt's color in relation to the socks. This ending choice presents a concise description of the coordination, or lack thereof, of the individual's outfit. Choosing b) to end the sentence would have changed the meaning significantly. It would focus more on the matching nature of the shirt and the socks, thus implying that the contrast lies more between the shoes and the socks instead of the shirt.

Summary:","completion":"Lithuania has faced continuous political changes since being occupied by German troops in 1915 during World War I. It declared independence in 1918 and was recognized by Soviet Russia in 1920 under the Treaty of Moscow. Lithuania experienced military operations, coup attempts, and power struggles throughout the 20th century, with the USSR occupying it at different points in time. After declaring independence again in 1990, Lithuania faced an economic crisis due to an imposed embargo. A referendum in 1991 saw an overwhelming vote in favor of independence, which led to Soviet recognition of Lithuania's independence, and later, Lithuania's membership in the OSCE and UN. The country adopted a new constitution in 1992, joined NATO in 2004, and became a member of the EU in 2004. In recent years, tensions with Russia have persisted, with Lithuania joining the eurozone in 2015 and reinstituting military conscription the same year due to concerns over Russian assertiveness in the Baltic region."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer:","completion":"The world's smallest bird is a species of hummingbird called the Bee Hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), which is native to the island country of Cuba and the Isla de la Juventud, a smaller island located off the southwestern coast of Cuba. This tiny bird indeed lives up to its name as it is about the size of a large bee, measuring between 5.5 to 6.1 centimeters (2.2 to 2.4 inches) in length and weighing just around 1.6 to 1.9 grams (0.056 to 0.067 ounces). The Bee Hummingbird exhibits sexual dimorphism, meaning there are noticeable and distinctive differences between the males and females of the species. Males of the Bee Hummingbird species are smaller and more brightly colored than the females. The males have an iridescent red or pink head, gorget (throat feathers), and upper chest, whereas the females are mainly green with blue colorations and white underparts, including the tail feathers marked with blue and black tips. As with all hummingbirds, the Bee Hummingbird is an agile and quick flyer, capable of producing rapid wing beats, hovering, and flying backward or upside down. Its extremely small size and highly specialized morphology enable it to feed on nectar from various flowers, particularly those with tubular shapes that are most suited for its long, slender bill. The bird's fast metabolism compels it to consume large amounts of nectar to maintain its energy levels. Moreover, the Bee Hummingbird has a unique reproductive process. It begins during the mating season, when the male performs a fascinating, intricate flight display to attract the attention of the female. After mating, the female builds a nest, typically measuring around 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter, using materials like plant fibers, lichens, and cobwebs. This nest is often situated on a slender tree branch. The female then lays one to two tiny eggs, measuring approximately 0.3 grams (0.01 ounces) each. She assumes the responsibility of incubating the eggs for around 16 to 20 days before they hatch. The Bee Hummingbird is highly significant in the ecosystem as it plays a crucial role in plant pollination. Its feeding habits uniquely facilitate the cross-pollination of various flowers. Despite being a locally abundant species, the Bee Hummingbird does face threats due to habitat loss, mainly driven by deforestation, agricultural transformation, and urbanization. These activities have caused a decline in the availability of suitable nesting sites and food sources. Currently, the IUCN Red List categorizes the Bee Hummingbird as \\"Near Threatened,\\" suggesting the importance of implementing conservation measures and monitoring the species to ensure its survival and protection for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which soil from these two parcels has a poor structure? Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year. Hint: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils.

Interval training is a form of training in which you alternate periods of moderate-intensity exercise with high-intensity exercise. Interval training may help increase fat loss, as it allows you to work out more efficiently. It also burns more calories — your body will continue to burn calories for hours after you have completed HIIT training. If you want to try interval training, decide on the length of your intervals. Many people think interval training is complicated, but there are actually no prescriptive rules. You can choose any length for your intervals of intense activity. You can do them for up to two or three minutes, or for as short as 20 seconds. You may want to do some trial and error before setting hard and fast rules for yourself. You may find, when working out, two minute intervals wear you down fast. Instead, try going for intervals of one minute or 30 seconds. You can also alternate. You can warm up with a few intervals of 30 seconds, and then move on to intervals of a minute. Once you've decided on intervals, you can begin your routine. During that time, go at a steady pace for two to five minutes, then switch to a high-intensity pace for 30 seconds (or however long you choose). Continue this pattern for the duration of your workout routine. Your HIIT workout should last between 20 and 30 minutes. Your heart rate should be at 85% during the high-intensity interval. When it comes to interval training targeted specifically at fat burning, rules depend heavily on your personal fitness level, target heart rate, current weight, and many other factors. Therefore, it's a good idea to discuss your desire to burn more fat with a personal trainer. He or she can help you figure out the time and duration of your intervals. Interval training comes with certain risks. You should be careful about engaging in interval training without talking to a doctor, especially if you have certain conditions. If you have heart disease, you may want to talk to your doctor before attempting interval training. Injury is a risk if you rush into a routine that's too strenuous. It may be a good idea to start out with just one or two high intensity intervals during your regular workout.","completion":"Interval training alternates moderate and high-intensity exercise periods, potentially increasing fat loss, burning calories, and improving efficiency, but should be tailored to personal fitness levels and discussed with a doctor or trainer to minimize risks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed Context: Set several months after the events of the original film, runaway teenager Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins) uses an extract of monkshood to fight the effects of the lycanthropy that transformed her sister into a werewolf and it is now affecting her.The opening credits play over Brigitte shaving the hair all over her body, cutting her arm with a scalpel, then injecting herself with a dose of monkshood, then cutting to Brigitte in a library, where the librarian Jeremy (Brendan Fletcher) clumsily hits on her. When she goes to check out her books, her library card has too many fines owing, and she walks out, leaving the books behind.Back in her motel room, she inspects her latest cut and records the time and state of healing on a page filled with similar entries. Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), her late sister, appears to her as an apparition, saying that she is healing faster and the monkshood is not a cure. It only slows the transformation.Brigitte shoots a deadly second dose of monkshood, and immediately after, Brigitte senses the presence of the male werewolf that has been stalking her, whose identity is unknown. She hastily packs and opens the door to find Jeremy with her library books. However, the additional dose has pushed her into toxic shock. Jeremy gets her in his car and is about to drive her to hospital, when the driver side window is smashed, and the werewolf drags him from the car. Brigitte stumbles down the street and collapses in the snow.She wakes up in a building which is a combination of a rehab clinic for drug abusing girls and chronic care patient facility, located in the only operational section of a large, old hospital. She attempts, but fails to escape. When delivered to the clinic's director Alice (Janet Kidder), she pleads to be released, but is refused.

Answer the following question: Bailey was in a fight and was told the school would be sending an expulsion notice. Given the context: What does Bailey need to do before this? Possible answers: needed to trash the house, needed to run away, needed to plan on what to say in their defense Answer:","completion":"Before receiving the expulsion notice, Bailey needs to assess the situation and take several crucial steps to address the problem proactively. Among the possible options presented, the most appropriate action for Bailey would be to plan what to say in their defense. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of each option before deciding how to proceed. Firstly, trashing the house is not a solution in this situation. Such behaviour could exacerbate the problem by showing a lack of responsibility and maturity, which are qualities needed when addressing a serious issue like expulsion. This action could also lead to further disciplinary measures and potential legal consequences. Secondly, running away is also not a viable option. Escaping from the situation will not resolve the problem and may signal that Bailey is unwilling to face the consequences of their actions. Running away may also lead to additional issues, such as concerns for Bailey's safety and well-being. This option does not address the underlying issue and may only further complicate matters. The most appropriate and constructive course of action for Bailey would be to plan what to say in their defense. Here are some steps Bailey should consider to prepare effectively: 1. Reflect on the incident: Bailey should begin by analyzing the events that led to the fight. They must recognize and acknowledge their role in the altercation and any other factors contributing to the situation. This reflection will help Bailey develop a better understanding of the incident and show their willingness to take responsibility for their actions. 2. Gather evidence: Bailey should gather any evidence or documentation related to the incident that could help their defense. This may include witness statements, any photographs or videos, or even information about the other individuals involved (e.g., past aggressive behavior). This evidence can be crucial in supporting Bailey's case. 3. Consult with a trusted adult: Bailey should seek advice from a trusted adult, such as a parent, guardian, or teacher. These individuals can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to approach the situation, as well as emotional support. 4. Develop a clear, concise defense argument: Bailey should come up with a clear and logical defense argument that addresses the reasons for their actions and presents any factors that could potentially justify or mitigate the severity of the incident. They should also be prepared to acknowledge any wrongdoing and express remorse and willingness to learn from their mistakes. 5. Practice the defense: Bailey should rehearse their defense before presenting it to school officials. Practicing the defense can help Bailey remain calm, collected, and articulate when discussing the incident with the necessary parties. 6. Be prepared for possible outcomes: Finally, Bailey should be prepared for various outcomes of the expulsion hearing and consider how they might respond and move forward in each scenario. This preparation can help alleviate stress and uncertainty related to the disciplinary process. In summary, the most appropriate course of action for Bailey to take before receiving the expulsion notice is to plan what to say in their defense. By reflecting on the situation, gathering evidence, consulting with trusted adults, and preparing a clear argument, Bailey can address the issue responsibly and constructively, demonstrating their willingness to learn from their mistakes. Trashing the house or running away would only exacerbate the situation and may lead to additional negative consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As a magician Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel,","completion":"As a magician, Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel, skillfully maneuvering through elaborate performance routines that leave her audience questioning their own sense of reality and perception. Magic, as an art form, has always been about capturing the wonder and amazement of its audience. As a seasoned magician, Cynthia has honed her craft to effectively captivate and manipulate the expectations of those around her, especially individuals such as Rachel who often find themselves questioning their own senses. Over time, Cynthia has developed techniques and tools to support her skill set in creating a world of enchantment and illusion. To truly trick people like Rachel, magicians such as Cynthia employ numerous methods based on psychology, misdirection, and finesse. They combine these elements to create seemingly impossible acts that leave spectators in awe. Let's take a deeper look into some of these strategies and how they contribute to a magician's overall success in the art of deception. 1. Psychology: A magician's understanding of human psychology is critical, as they need to be in tune with their audience's thoughts, expectations, and emotions. By exploiting these factors, Cynthia is able to subtly lead Rachel and others through a predetermined experience, while at the same time, making it appear to be impromptu. This often involves using cognitive biases, such as the \\"confirmation bias,\\" where Rachel is drawn to notice and accept information that confirms her preconceptions, while disregarding information that contradicts them. 2. Misdirection: At the heart of every magic trick is a well-planned act of misdirection. Cynthia uses this technique to divert Rachel's attention away from the crucial moment when the trick is executed. This may involve using hand gestures, body movements, and even verbal cues to lead Rachel's focus toward irrelevant details, while the real action occurs elsewhere. As a result, Rachel sees what Cynthia wants her to see, while the secret behind the illusion remains hidden. 3. Finesse: In addition to psychological manipulation and misdirection, the art of magic also requires a great deal of technical skill and finesse. For instance, a magician may employ \\"sleight of hand\\" techniques, where dexterity and precision are used to manipulate objects or cards in a manner that is virtually undetectable to the naked eye. Cynthia has spent countless hours perfecting such techniques, and this mastery enables her to perform her magic tricks with grace and seamless execution. 4. Patter: Magicians often utilize storytelling or patter to help enhance the atmosphere during a performance. The use of an engaging script not only keeps the audience entertained but can also serve as an additional form of misdirection. Cynthia's ability to weave intricate stories and humorous anecdotes into her routines provides a further layer of deception, as Rachel and the other spectators are momentarily caught up in the narrative, their attention drawn away from the mechanics of the trick itself. 5. Timing and presence: The success of a magician's performance often comes down to their ability to command attention and control the pace of the act. Cynthia has honed the skill of maintaining a strong stage presence, dictating the flow of her show based on cues from her audience. By carefully timing her tricks and regulating the rhythm of her performance, she is able to keep Rachel and other participants fully engaged and invested in the unfolding narrative. In conclusion, as a magician, Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel through a mastery of psychology, misdirection, finesse, storytelling, and stage presence. By using these various techniques and elements together, she is able to craft a world of illusion that leaves her audience captivated, curious, and hungering for more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. I am facing a new situation today: Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","completion":"The northern region. Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article. - Biodiversity is determined by many factors, including abiotic stress. - When abiotic stress is high, biodiversity tends to be low. - When abiotic stress is low, biodiversity tends to be high. - As abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases, which makes them more likely to become threatened, endangered, or extinct. Step 2: Analyze the given new situation. - Italy has two distinct regions: the northern region with high abiotic stress and the southern region with low abiotic stress. Step 3: Apply the background information to the new situation. - Since high abiotic stress negatively affects biodiversity and leads to a lower number of species, the northern region with high abiotic stress should have fewer species inhabiting it compared to the southern region with low abiotic stress. Therefore, based on the relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity outlined in the background article, the northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to more abiotic stress, likely has fewer species inhabiting it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An executive, very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life... With this argument, the somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, I didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go on watching the movie. The French cinema, in general, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life, opposed to the more stereotyped American cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven as Michael Landon... Really nasty, in my humble opinion. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as a mix of disappointment and frustration. The reviewer initially had low expectations for the film but was intrigued by some of its elements, such as the acting performances and the realism of French cinema compared to their perception of the more stereotyped American cinema. However, the emotional impact of the movie and its conclusion leave the reviewer feeling disillusioned. They describe the ending as absurd, moral as cheap, and the overall tone as morally disgusting and nasty. This demonstrates that the reviewer’s initial skepticism was not entirely assuaged by some of the movie’s redeeming qualities, and their disappointment is further exacerbated by the film’s failure to meet what they view as the potential offered by the French cinema."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

During those times, Illinois had already gained a notorious reputation for its endemic political corruption. Blagojevich's anti-corruption slate struck a chord with voters, who were tired of decades of scandal-ridden governance. They saw him as a promising figure who would put an end to unethical practices and restore public trust in the state government. But little did the voters know that this would be a classic tale of irony and deception. Blagojevich's campaign promised increased transparency, accountability, and an end to the \\"pay-to-play\\" politics that had plagued Illinois for decades. His charisma, populist message, and commitment to fight corruption resonated with voters across the state, propelling him to a landslide victory in the gubernatorial election. People celebrated his triumph, believing they had finally elected a governor who would break the cycle of corruption and bring about lasting change. Governor Blagojevich wasted no time in implementing his reform programs. He leveraged his newly acquired political capital to challenge the status quo, launching initiatives aimed at increasing transparency in government contracting and rooting out graft within state departments. Illinois, it seemed, was finally on the path towards ethical governance. Praise for Blagojevich's leadership spread outside the state, earning him recognition as a bold reformer with the potential for higher political office. However, as the years passed, whispers of doubt and suspicion began to circulate. The crusading governor seemed to be acting increasingly erratic and authoritarian. Rumors spread of shady backroom deals and dubious pay-to-play practices. The anti-corruption champion was fast becoming a source of embarrassment for the very people who had embraced him as their savior. It was not long before the federal investigation, “Operation Board Games,” revealed shocking evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the Blagojevich administration. The governor was accused of several high-value frauds, including his infamous attempt to sell the US Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. In December 2008, Blagojevich was arrested by the FBI, effectively bringing his political career to a grinding halt. The arrest came as a gut-wrenching betrayal for the people of Illinois, who were once again left to bear the brunt of the deceitful nature of their political leadership. Blagojevich was subsequently impeached by the Illinois General Assembly and removed from office in January 2009. The story of Rod Blagojevich stands as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hypocrisy and the thin line between a genuine desire to reform and the seduction of power. Though he rose to prominence as an anti-corruption crusader, his eventual descent into the very cesspool of misconduct he vowed to drain demonstrates the allure of power and how easily it can corrupt even the most idealistic of politicians. This tale of betrayal serves as a poignant reminder that restoring public trust in political institutions necessitates a collective responsibility among elected officials, civil society, and the public at large to hold politicians accountable and to demand transparency and ethical governance. As we strive to ensure a brighter future for the next generation, this story should be etched in our minds – not just as a historical footnote but as a stark warning of the consequences of neglecting the values of integrity and honesty in public service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What individual first used cotton wool medically?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What individual first used cotton wool medically?\\" The sentence offers specific and relevant information that directly answers the question. It provides the name of the individual, Sampson Gamgee, who first used cotton wool for medical purposes, and it also gives context by mentioning the location and institution (the Queen's Hospital, later named the General Hospital, in Birmingham, England) where this pioneering use of cotton wool took place. To understand the significance and background of this discovery, let's explore further details: Sampson Gamgee (1828–1886) was an English surgeon who contributed to the development of various surgical procedures and medical techniques in the 19th century. One of his most notable contributions was the introduction of cotton wool as a medical material for dressing and dealing with wounds. Cotton wool, also known as absorbent cotton or cotton batting, is a soft, fluffy, and absorbent material made from short cotton fibers that have been carded to remove impurities and aligned for uniformity. The development of this cotton wool made it possible to dress wounds more efficiently, protect them from external bacteria, and facilitate faster healing by providing an absorbent and cushioning layer between the wound and any external factors. Before the introduction of cotton wool by Sampson Gamgee, the medical community relied on materials like linen and muslin for wound dressings. These materials were not as effective in maintaining a sterile environment and had limited absorbent capacity compared to cotton wool. Gamgee's innovation transformed wound care and paved the way for the development of modern wound dressings and techniques. In conclusion, the sentence in question does provide a valid answer to the query about the individual who first used cotton wool for medical purposes. Sampson Gamgee, a surgeon in 19th century England, introduced cotton wool to the medical field at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, significantly improving the efficiency and efficacy of wound care and paving the way for future advancements in medical technology and treatment procedures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hoping to rebound from their Thursday night road loss to the Cowboys, the Packers went home for Favre's 250th (270th including playoffs) consecutive start, along with Green Bay's Week 14 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers sliced away in the second quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant getting a 6-yard TD run, while CB Will Blackmon returned a punt 57&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders would end the half with their only score of the game as QB Josh McCown completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. In the third quarter, Green Bay took control with rookie Mason Crosby nailing a 44-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing an 80-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, while Blackmon recovered an Oakland fumble in their endzone for a touchdown (making him the first player since Cincinnati's Lemar Parrish in 1974 to return a punt and a fumble for a touchdown in one game).

Write a summary based on this article: Texas Women Fight Rule for Burial of Miscarriages AUSTIN, Texas (CN) — As Hillary Clinton gave her concession speech Wednesday, women in Texas pleaded with state officials to stop proposed rules that would require embryonic and fetal tissue to be buried or cremated after an abortion, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Women said Texas' proposed rules would restrict access to abortion and inflict further pain and suffering on women who have lost a baby during pregnancy. It was the Texas Department of Health Services' second public hearing on rules that would require embryonic and fetal tissue to be buried or cremated after an abortion, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Texas officials say that all fetal remains, regardless of the period of gestation, deserve \\"a dignified interment,\\" while opponents say the measure is just another in a series of unconstitutional attempts to restrict abortion access in Texas. \\"These proposed rules are not meant to protect people's health and safety,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \\"They are just another attempt to restrict access to care that's deeply needed and shame and hurt women in the process. \\"The department has not provided any shred of evidence that Texas's current rules have not protected health and safety.\\" Some spoke on behalf of groups such as the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) or Jane's Due Process, some on their own behalf. Many shared painful stories of their miscarriages or abortions, and said that having arrange a funeral for fetal remains would have made these experiences even worse. There also are concerns about how the rules will be implemented. The Texas Medical Association asked the Department of Health Services in August whether a death certificate will be required all fetal tissues interred, which raises privacy issues. The Medical Association also expressed concerns about the costs of this, echoing concerns the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Texas raised in July. Ashley Blinkhorn, who cried as she testified about the two miscarriages she suffered before she was 25, said the rules would affect \\"so many people in so many ways that people aren't considering.\\" \\"You're monkeying around with people's lives here,\\" Blinkhorn said. Texas Health Commission spokesman Bryan Black told the Texas Tribune in July, after the new rules were quietly published in the Texas Register, that they were developed to \\"ensure Texas law maintains the highest standards of human dignity.\\" Gov. Greg Abbott asked the department and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in January to review the rules on disposition of \\"special waste\\" from healthcare facilities. The rules today still allow for fetal tissue to be incinerated or ground and flushed or disposed of at a sanitary landfill. Abbott wrote in a July fund-raising letter for his anti-abortion initiative that the rule changes were designed to \\"reflect our respect for the sanctity of life\\" and that the groups protesting the rules \\"simply refuse to acknowledge any rights of the unborn.\\" Representatives from the Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life made similar arguments at the Wednesday hearing. \\"It is unconscionable that anyone would defend the grinding and flushing of the bodies of unborn babies who are victims of abortion down the drain and into a city sewer system as if they were mere medical waste,\\" said John Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life. \\"That method of the disposition of the remains should be banned, as the proposed rules do.\\" Blake Rocap, legislative director for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said the state should concentrate on ensuring that patients are \\"supported and respected and empowered in their health care decision,\\" instead of \\"passing laws that force government intrusion on a patient's access to health care.\\" \\"This rule provides no public health benefit, just like the state's abortion restrictions that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in June,\\" Rocap said in a statement Wednesday. He referred to Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, in which the court rejected by 5-3 vote a 2013 Texas law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, and required the clinics to meet the same minimum standards as ambulatory surgical centers. The court found that neither provision provided any medical benefits that would justify the undue burdens imposed upon women seeking abortions. Opponents to the new fetal burial rules believe that even if they do go into effect, they will be struck down by the courts on the basis of Hellerstedt. However, they also are concerned that president-elect Donald Trump may appoint a justice to the truncated court that may help overturn Hellerstedt, and even Roe v. Wade. The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement Wednesday that the country \\"strands perilously close to a return to the dark days when women were forced to put their own lives at risk to get safe and legal abortion care.\\" \\"It is 2016, and our leaders should build on the historic advancements we've made for women's health and rights, not threaten to undo them,\\" the center said. It's clear that a fight is coming in Texas. \\"I'm sure that after last night's results many people feel emboldened to continue their attacks on women,\\" said Sheila Sorvari, who testified Wednesday. \\"But if you thought we were going to pull up the covers and cry and go away, you're wrong.\\" The Texas Department of Health Services will incorporate comments from the hearing with previous comments from the public consultation period in August. It is unclear whether any changes will be made to the proposed rules. No date has been set for the rules to go into effect. ||||| Wednesday’s public hearing was the second on a proposed rule change. About 30 people testified at the hearing Wednesday at state health agency’s offices in Central Austin. In a last-ditch effort, abortion rights advocates urged state officials Wednesday to reconsider a proposal that would require cremation or burial of miscarried and aborted fetuses. The Texas Department of State Health Services held a second public hearing about the rule, which was first proposed in July. Armed with a few new arguments, critics said the rule not only discourages women from abortion and retraumatizes them after a miscarriage, but it doesn’t necessarily further “uphold the dignity of life” as some proponents have argued because mass cremation and burial would still be allowed. “This is not about children. … This is not about dignity. … This is not about health,” said Gordon Vincent, who was among 30 or so people who testified Wednesday. Abortion opponents have argued that the proposed rule would give fetuses the respect that they deserve. They said that women are often appalled by the current rules for fetal tissue disposal. + Jay Janner Ashley Blinkhorn cries in the hallway after she testified Wednesday against a proposal that would require cremation or burial of miscarried ... read more Jay Janner × Current rules allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill. “It is unconscionable that anyone would defend the grinding and flushing of bodies of unborn babies who are victims of abortions down the drain into a city sewer system as if they were mere medical waste,” Joe Pojman with the Texas Alliance for Life testified Wednesday. Agency officials have argued that the rule would protect the public from communicable diseases. The proposal is a part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Life Initiative, meant to “protect the unborn and prevent the sale of baby body parts,” according to a statement on his website. After holding a public comment period and a hearing in August about the proposal, the state agency in September published an analysis that concluded the rule wouldn’t fiscally burden medical facilities. Blake Rocap, with the abortion rights group NARAL-Pro Choice, testified Wednesday that the state agency had an opportunity to consider thousands of comments from the public over the last few months and change the rule but failed to compromise. “Instead, you mashed together things that are not part of modern medical practice and imposed this mandate on every family,” Rocap said. Some women were in tears as they shared stories about their traumatic miscarriages and abortions. They said they would have suffered more had they been required to bury or cremate the fetus. Nakia Winfield, a mental health fellow with the National Association of Social Workers, said that many women who choose to have an abortion can barely afford it. Adding burial requirements would cost up to 2,000, she said. Chris Williston, with nonprofit The Mary Claire Project which provides low-cost burials, echoed state officials’ assertions that public-private partnerships would help defray costs. John Seago with Texas Right to Life said that he would like the rule clarified to exclude the requirement from women who miscarry at home. Rebecca Teng, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Central Texas, said the rule is an unfunded mandate for providers. Providers already treat fetal tissue with respect, rendering the rule pointless, she said. “Let’s dedicate these resources to help women, infants, children and families instead,” Teng said. State officials said that they will take all comments into consideration and decide on an implementation date, if any. ||||| Through tears, Austin resident Ashley Blinkhorn said she had undergone two miscarriages by age 25. If a proposed rule that forces women to bury or cremate their aborted or miscarried fetal tissue (rather than deposit in sanitary sewers and medical-waste landfills) had been in effect, Blinkhorn wouldn't have sought medical care because the costs associated with the regulation would've been too high, she told the Department of State Health Services during a hearing on the new rule earlier this week. \\"There's no health reason that we should do this,\\" said an emotional Blinkhorn. \\"Health clinics are already following state standards, there's no reason to change the rule for this kind of waste. It's not reasonable and not necessary. This is targeted at [women], and this is not something we need to stand for.\\" The Health Department held its second public hearing (see \\"Fetal Burial Saga Continues,\\" Aug. 5) on the anti-abortion rule on Wednesday, Nov. 9, the morning after an unexpected victory for anti-abortion and sexist President-elect Donald Trump, casting an additional pall on an already somber hearing. The rule could be a harbinger of what's to come nationally under a Trump presidency: Vice President-elect Mike Pence signed a similar law in Indiana (temporarily blocked by a federal judge in June) even harsher than the one proposed today in Texas. Both men have vowed to ensure Supreme Court appointments that would undo abortion rights, including Roe v. Wade and the historic victory of Texas' Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. At the hearing, a stream of anti-choice speakers with Texas Alliance for Life, the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, and Texas Right to Life applauded the measure as a move toward \\"dignity\\" and \\"respect,\\" and used graphic language to describe fetal disposal. \\"It is unconscionable to grind and flush an unborn child ... like they're mere medical waste,\\" said TAL's Joe Pojman. John Seago with TRL noted their group wanted a clarification showing that women who experience miscarriages at home would not be subject to the rule. On the other end, pro-choice advocates with Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, Jane's Due Process, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, and individual citizens criticized the regulation as another attempt to shame, stigmatize, and restrict women's access to abortion care. \\"Legally, practically, and morally, these rules are unnecessary,\\" said Tina Hester of Jane's Due Process in testimony read aloud by proxy. Since the state will not shoulder the price tag of burials and cremation, the cost burden falls on abortion providers and patients, already straining from a trail of anti-choice laws, said pro-choice speakers. The Funeral Consumers Alliance of Texas estimates the rule could add 2,000 to the cost of abortion care. The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, and health professionals have expressed deep concern over how to implement the rules. \\"The significant financial burden, the invasion of privacy, and intrusion of government will only hurt women,\\" said Round Rock OB-GYN Rebecca Teng, echoing some of the overall worry from the medical community. Advocates also stressed that the state has shown no medical evidence the rule would actually promote the health and safety of women – a requirement mandated by the SCOTUS Whole Woman's decision. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU of Texas have both warned the rule is unconstitutional and will likely spark a legal challenge (\\"Fetal Burial Rule May Flout Constitutional Limits,\\" Aug. 12). The proposed regulation still needs to be approved by the Health and Human Services Commission executive commissioner and posted in the Texas Register. It would then take effect 20 days later. DSHS spokesperson Carrie Williams said the Health Department will offer additional information on next steps after reviewing the thousands of comments it received. But with the blessing and encouragement from conservative anti-choice Gov. Greg Abbott, it's hard to imagine the department turning back without yet another lawsuit to stop them. |||||","completion":"In Texas, women have protested the proposed rule change that would require embryonic and foetal tissue to be buried or cremated following an abortion, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy.

Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \\"Labour stalwarts\\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \\"the terrors of the Nazi War\\" had drawn \\"renewed faith and hope\\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \\"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright.

Her father, Gerardo Velasquez, was a construction estimator, and her mother, Teresita (nee Ansong), was a homemaker. The singer has three younger sisters, Cacai, Diane and Deca, and a younger brother, Jojo. The family moved to Hinundayan, Southern Leyte where Velasquez spent the early years of her life. Context: In 1990, Velasquez signed a contract with Vicor Music and released her second studio album, Nineteen 90. Velasquez worked with Louie Ocampo who provided the musical arrangement for the album's lead single \\"Narito Ako\\", a song originally recorded and performed by Maricris Belmont and written by Nonong Pedero for the 1978 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival. In July 1990, Velasquez headlined her first major concert as a solo artist in support of the album at the Folk Arts Theater. She recorded a duet with Jose Mari Chan, \\"Please Be Careful With My Heart\\", for his sixth studio album Constant Change, and contributed backing vocals for Gary Valenciano's \\"Each Passing Night\\", a single from his sixth album, Faces of Love. At the end of 1990, Velasquez made her North American concert debut at the Isaac Stern Auditorium of Carnegie Hall in New York City--a first for an Asian solo artist. Soon after, British theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh invited Velasquez to audition for the West End production of the musical Miss Saigon. Velasquez received a letter from the production company offering intensive musical theater training in the United Kingdom; she declined the offer citing inadequate theatrical experience. Velasquez's third studio album Tagala Talaga was released in October 1991, and included cover versions of classic OPM recordings by National Artist for Music recipients Ryan Cayabyab, Lucio San Pedro and Levi Celerio. The album's lead single \\"Buhay Ng Buhay Ko\\", originally recorded by Leah Navarro, was also written by Pedero, who Velasquez previously worked with on Nineteen 90. Three singles were released the following year--\\"Anak, \\"Sa Ugoy Ng Duyan\\" and \\"Kastilyong Buhangin\\". By early 1993, music executives Alex Chan and Norman Cheng from PolyGram Far East approached Velasquez and began negotiations for a record deal, mapping her commercial debut in the region. Following the deal, PolyGram Far East announced its joint venture licensing agreement in the Philippines with the formation of its subsidiary, PolyCosmic Records. Reason Enough, released in July 1993, was the newly formed label's maiden release. David Gonzales of AllMusic described the album as a \\"mixture of passionate, easy listening love songs, which are popular in the Philippines, and songs with a modern, contemporary touch, more attuned to an international audience\\". Velasquez recorded a duet with Paul Anka for the album's first single \\"It's Hard to Say Goodbye\\", marking her first musical collaboration with an international artist. The album's second single, \\"Sana Maulit Muli\\", became one of the most popular songs of her career, and won the Awit Award for Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist in 1994. The album received a double platinum certification. Question: And what is Reason Enough?.

Wilsonâs stood out since the beginning of her tenure in Congress having been one of the first to suggest the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin was due to racism (the facts be damned!). Similarly Wilson labeled General Kellyâs âempty barrelâ description of her as a âracist term.â Wilson âs become the standard-bearer for everything thatâs wrong with the Democrat party today a substance-less privilege abusing politician whoâs crawled her way to the top of local politics and is now entrenched in Congress for as long as she chooses to stay because thereâs no organized partisan opposition in her district.

And the fact that there is actually a party in American politics that would allow someone so dumb in their caucus only proves how unseriously Democrats take themselves and how much contempt party leaders have for innocent American voters. â Congresswoman Wilson has long been known for pretty much only one thing: the ridiculous colorful feathered and sequined cowboy hats she sports around the halls of Congress.

As amply noted the Republican Party has massive issues of its own; the entrenched GOP establishment will take years to vanquish and the #NeverTrump âconservativesâ have dug themselves a very deep hole from which they cannot emerge without losing face within their own circles.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn't even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I'm still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn't eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven't set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I'm barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they've moved on, but I'm still too scared to find out. It's an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn't actually experience anything. :/ Question: Who did he flirt with?

Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. .

If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Imagine that we're talking about a game called football, where you have athletes playing on teams. The premise, or the situation that we have here, is about a football player from Wisconsin who almost stopped the other team's quarterback from passing the ball. The quarterback is the person who throws the ball in the game. Now, the hypothesis is like a guess that we're trying to see if it's right or not. Our guess is that athletes play football.

He is known to have written more than 90 plays, though only seven survive. The most famous of these are the trilogy known as Orestia. Also well-known are The Persians and Prometheus Bound. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Aeschylus is often called the daughter of Greek tragedy.","completion":"No, based on the given paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence stating \\"Aeschylus is often called the daughter of Greek tragedy\\" is true. In fact, the paragraph explicitly states that Aeschylus is often called the father of Greek tragedy. Calling Aeschylus the \\"daughter\\" of Greek tragedy would be inaccurate and misleading. Aeschylus is referred to as the father of Greek tragedy due to his significant contributions to the development of this dramatic genre. He is credited as the first playwright to use multiple actors on stage, thus initiating more complex interactions between characters and allowing for the development of plot and character relationships. Additionally, Aeschylus incorporated thought-provoking themes and the idea of divine retribution into his plays, enabling Greek tragedies to explore deeper human emotions and universal moral questions. To sum up, the sentence \\"Aeschylus is often called the daughter of Greek tragedy\\" is not true based on the information provided in the paragraph. The correct statement is that Aeschylus is often called the father of Greek tragedy, due to his pioneering role in the development of this literary form."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: To prevent unwanted pregnancies, you'd keep the heifers and the bulls in separate what? Options: A. cattle show B. houses C. corral D. dairy barn E. countryside","completion":"To prevent unwanted pregnancies in cattle, the ideal option in line with common sense to separate the heifers (female cows that haven't yet given birth) and the bulls (intact adult male cows) would be Option C: Corral. In a corral system, you can effectively manage and organize cattle in separate areas, which is essential for maintaining control over breeding patterns and preventing unplanned pregnancies. Corrals are specifically designed to shelter and confine livestock, provide secure access to water and feeding systems, and enable easy observation and monitoring. By keeping heifers and bulls in separate corrals, you can avoid accidental mating occurrences and ensure that you are only breeding the animals intentionally when desired. Here is a detailed analysis of the options given: A. Cattle Show: This is not a suitable option for managing the breeding process or preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle. Cattle shows are public events where livestock are typically displayed and judged based on their appearance, traits, and overall conformity to breed standards. They are not designed or intended to serve as a separation mechanism for managing the breeding process, and usually will only last for a short period of time. B. Houses: The term \\"houses\\" is typically not associated with housing cattle. Cattle are livestock animals that are generally kept outdoors in specific animal shelters, like barns or corrals. Moreover, keeping heifers and bulls in separate houses would not necessarily be practical or efficient for managing them on a farm, since it could create issues related to space, access to water, feeding, and overall animal husbandry. D. Dairy Barn: A dairy barn is a type of livestock shelter commonly used for housing dairy cows and managing their milk production process. While dairy barns may include separate stalls or areas for individual animals, they are generally not designed or intended as a means to separate heifers and bulls for breeding purposes. Dairy barns focus more on the care, comfort, and well-being of dairy cows to optimize milk production rather than preventing unwanted pregnancies. E. Countryside: This option is not ideal either because it provides little to no control over the livestock. When cattle are left in the vast, open spaces of the countryside, it can be difficult to monitor and manage their interactions, making it nearly impossible to prevent unwanted pregnancies between heifers and bulls in such an environment. In conclusion, the most effective option for preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle by separating heifers and bulls would be to use separate corrals. This method of confinement allows for controlled breeding, ease of monitoring, and proper management of all aspects of animal husbandry, ultimately helping in maintaining a healthy and productive livestock population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed. College student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night, much to the chagrin of Charley. While visiting Peter's apartment Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes drawn to one of the four, the alluring Regine. Charley drives Alex back to her dorm and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs. Later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day, Charley talks to his psychiatrist, Dr. Harrison, who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there, however, he sees his friend Richie with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood.

Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"From the provided information, the relationship Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, had with a Democrat was the appointment of Susan Kennedy, a Democrat, as his Chief of Staff. This move was considered significant because Schwarzenegger went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists in choosing a member of the rival political party for such a key role in his administration. Appointing a person from the opposition party as Chief of Staff can signify that Schwarzenegger was aiming for a more bipartisan and politically moderate approach during his tenure as Governor. The Chief of Staff is a crucial position in any administration as they oversee and manage the day-to-day operations of the office, maintain strong connections with key legislators and interest groups, and develop or help implement policy strategies for the Governor. The decision to appoint Susan Kennedy reflects Schwarzenegger's desire to build a winning legacy and maintain a cooperative attitude towards both parties in order to find common ground on policy issues. Additionally, with the next gubernatorial election on the horizon, this move suggests that Schwarzenegger was trying to appeal to a broader base of voters, including both Republicans and Democrats, in hopes of bolstering his image and securing further political success. In summary, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, had a working relationship with a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, whom he appointed as his Chief of Staff despite the recommendations of Republican strategists. This decision implies a desire for a more moderate political stance, bipartisan collaboration, and an effort to create a lasting legacy by engaging both sides of the political spectrum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Reading is the key to school success and, like any skill, it takes practice. A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Question: Rossman tells that any child who_will possibly be an automatic reader.

Build a movie plot around this: Which character leads anti-apartheid demonstrations? Dap Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Freedom of Dap\\" Step 1: Establish the main character Our story will center around Dap, a passionate and charismatic activist who leads anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa during the late 1980s. Dap is a black South African who has grown up witnessing the horrors of apartheid firsthand and is determined to bring an end to the injustice. Step 2: Introduce key supporting characters - Lerato, Dap's love interest, who is a journalist in a local newspaper, amplifying Dap's message to the public. - Johan, a white South African police officer who secretly sympathizes with the anti-apartheid movement but fears repercussions from his peers and superiors. - Naledi, Dap's devoted sister who discovers her own leadership qualities through her brother's activism. Step 3: Set up the inciting incident While attending a peaceful anti-apartheid protest, Dap witnesses the brutal beating of a fellow protestor by the police. This event drives him to begin organizing and leading demonstrations himself in the hopes of drawing attention to the apartheid government's cruelty and inspiring change. Step 4: Present conflicts and challenges - Dap faces constant danger from the police forces, who are tasked with quashing any dissension against the apartheid regime. - Johan struggles with his conflicting loyalties, questioning whether he should break his oath to protect and serve the apartheid government or stand up for what he knows is right. - Lerato faces pressure from her newspaper's editor to avoid covering the demonstrations or risk losing her job, meaning Dap's message could be silenced. Step 5: Include a turning point or climax One of the anti-apartheid demonstrations, led by Dap, turns violent when the police arrive and a confrontation ensues. In the chaos, Naledi is arrested and brutally beaten by a police officer. Johan, unable to stand by any longer, intervenes, saving Naledi's life and revealing his sympathies to Dap. Step 6: Show character growth and resolution - Dap and his fellow protestors continue to resist the apartheid regime, gaining international attention and support. - Lerato defies her editor by publishing a damning article about the apartheid government's violence against peaceful demonstrators, leading to more widespread media coverage of the issue. - Johan joins the anti-apartheid movement, providing crucial insider information on police tactics and strategy. Step 7: Reach a conclusion The apartheid regime eventually falls due to the pressure mounted by Dap’s and others’ activism, coupled with the broader international condemnation of the government. As South Africa moves towards a new era of equality, our main characters live on to witness – and help shape – the nation they fought so hard to change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban center and 5,150,072 in its province , it is Turkey's second largest city after former imperial capital Istanbul, having overtaken İzmir. The former Metropolitan archbishopric remains a triple titular see (Latin, Armenian Catholic and Orthodox). Ankara was Atatürk's headquarters from 1920 and has been the capital of the Republic since the latter's founding in 1923, replacing Istanbul (once the Byzantine capital Constantinople) following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the Angora wool shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair), and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at per head. Ankara is a very old city with various Hittite, Phrygian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archaeological sites. The historical center of town is a rocky hill rising over the left bank of the Ankara Çayı, a tributary of the Sakarya River, the classical Sangarius. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of the old citadel. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city, the most remarkable being the 20 Temple of Augustus and Rome that boasts the Monumentum Ancyranum, the inscription recording the \\"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\\". 1.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Answer the question A wet towel will dry when it is left in the Sun. Which process occurs to make this happen?","completion":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the given information, identify the processes under consideration, and finally, select the most suitable one. 1. Analyzing the given information: The problem states that a wet towel dries when left in the Sun. 2. Identifying the processes: There are several processes that could potentially occur to make this happen, such as conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. 3. Analyzing conduction: Heat transfer through a solid medium. In the context of the wet towel in the Sun, conduction may happen between the fibers of the towel. However, this process is not significant enough to cause the towel to dry. 4. Analyzing convection: The movement of hot molecules from one place to another, usually in fluids or gases. In this case, the air around the wet towel becomes warmer due to the Sun. Since air is a poor conductor, convection is primarily responsible for heating the air around the towel, but not for the drying process itself. 5. Analyzing radiation: The process of heat transfer through electromagnetic waves. The Sun emits radiant energy, which heats up the towel. Although radiation contributes to the heating of the towel, it is not the primary process responsible for drying the towel. 6. Analyzing evaporation: The process in which a liquid turns into a gas as a result of an increase in temperature and/or a decrease in pressure. In the case of the wet towel, the Sun's energy heats the liquid water in the towel, providing the necessary energy for the water molecules to escape into the air as water vapor. This process removes moisture from the towel, causing it to dry. Conclusion: Evaporation is the primary process that occurs when a wet towel is left in the Sun, causing it to dry. This is because the Sun's energy provides the necessary heat for the water molecules within the towel to escape into the air as water vapor, which in turn leads to the removal of moisture and the drying of the towel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To contour your lips, apply some highlighting powder along the top of your cupid's bow and a dab of bronzer just below your bottom lip. Blend well and apply some bright lipstick. These will make your head appear longer than it is wide, giving the illusion of a thinner face. Even a baseball cap that is higher than normal can help make your face look longer. When choosing earrings, go for ones that go past your jaw; this will draw attention away from the sides of your face. The more angular the earring is, the more will contrast with your face shape, making it appear thinner. If you are wearing your hair in an up-do, you can frame your face by wearing some long earrings. This will draw the eye downward, pulling attention away from the width of your face. Long necklaces will also give the illusion that your neck and face are longer. Necklaces that are too short will pull the eye upward and draw too much attention to the width of your face. If you do wear short necklaces and chokers, remember to frame your face by wearing your hair down or lettings your long bangs hang by your cheeks. Try to find something with a rectangular shape, but that still has rounded corners. Glasses that are wider than your face will make your face appear more narrow.

I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. There were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. There is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table. The menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it. Service was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. One thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it. There was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. When our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. Also there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A few weeks earlier, they had also agreed to give the government in Athens two more years to cut its overspending. That decision came as Greece's parliament approved a budget for 2013 that involves 9.4bn euros of spending cuts, a budget that triggered mass public protests in Athens. The delay in releasing the latest bailout money was largely due to wrangling between eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over whether and by how much to cut Greece's debt, which will inevitably grow even more if Athens continues overspending for longer than previously planned. Why is Greece in trouble? Greece was living beyond its means even before it joined the euro. After it adopted the single currency, public spending soared. Public sector wages, for example, rose 50% between 1999 and 2007 - far faster than in most other eurozone countries. The government also ran up big debts paying for the 2004 Athens Olympics. And while money flowed out of the government's coffers, its income was hit by widespread tax evasion. So, after years of overspending, its budget deficit - the difference between spending and income - spiralled out of control. Moreover, much of the borrowing was concealed, as successive Greek governments sought to meet the 3%-of-GDP cap on borrowing that is required of members of the euro. When the global financial downturn hit - and Greece's hidden borrowings came to light - the country was ill-prepared to cope. Debt levels reached the point where the country was no longer able to repay its loans, and was forced to ask for help from its European partners and the IMF in the form of massive loans. In the short term, however, the conditions attached to these loans have compounded Greece's woes. What has been done to help Greece? In short, a lot. In May 2010, the European Union and IMF provided 110bn euros (140bn: £88bn) of bailout loans to Greece to help the government pay its creditors. However, it soon became apparent that this would not be enough, so a second, 130bn-euro bailout was agreed earlier this year. As well as these two loans, which are made in stages, the vast majority of Greece's private-sector creditors agreed to write off about three-quarters of the debts owed to them by Athens. They also agreed to replace existing loans with new loans at a lower rate of interest. In the latest agreement, Greece's lenders have found ways to shave an extra 40bn euros off Greece's debtload. However, in return for all this help, the EU and IMF insisted that Greece embark on a major austerity drive involving drastic spending cuts, tax rises, and labour market and pension reforms. These have had a devastating effect on Greece's already weak economic recovery. The latest Greek budget predicts that the economy will shrink by 6.5% this year and by a further 4.5% in 2013. Greece has already been in recession for four years, and its economy is projected to have shrunk by a fifth between 2008 and the end of this year. Without economic growth, the Greek government cannot boost its own tax revenues and so has to rely on aid to pay its loans. Many commentators believe that even the combined 240bn euros of loans and the debt write-off will not be enough. Why did it take so long to agree the latest tranche of aid? Despite Greece approving its tough budget for 2013, the next tranche was not released immediately as there was no agreement among Greece's lenders on how to make the country's debt sustainable. Eurozone finance ministers agreed earlier this month to give Greece two more years - until 2016 - to meet the deficit reduction targets that are a condition of the bailout loans. The key to releasing the next tranche of bailout loans was to reach agreement on how to make Greek debt sustainable again. Greece's debt is currently forecast to hit almost 190% of GDP next year. The IMF made clear that it would only consider the debts sustainable if they could be brought down to 120% of GDP by 2020. The IMF will not lend money to a country whose debts it does not deem sustainable. Under the compromise, Greece's debts are now expected to fall to 124% of GDP by 2020. This will be done by cutting the interest rate on existing rescue loans, returning profits earned by the European Central Bank on Greek debts it owns, and helping Greece buy back its private-sector debts at their currently depressed market prices. It will not involve any write-off of the bailout loans owed by Greece - something that Germany and other lenders said would be unacceptable. The money will not be released until 14 December, in order to allow national parliaments in eurozone countries time to approve the deal. What happens next? When Antonis Samaras's New Democracy won the general election in June, he insisted Greece did not need a further bailout but wanted a two-year \\"breathing space\\" to meet the tough budget targets attached to the bailout from the EU and IMF. Greece has now been granted the extra time, but major problems remain and the financial markets are still nervous. If Greece's economy continues to contract sharply, the country may not be able to cut its overspending as much as planned, and may ultimately be unable to repay its debts, meaning it will need further help. If the rest of Europe is no longer willing to provide it, then Greece may be forced to leave the euro. There is, of course, the possibility that the Greek people, fed up with rising unemployment and falling living standards, will make it impossible for the government to continue even with the slower rate of austerity that is now planned. Why does this matter for the rest of Europe? If Greece does not repay its creditors, a dangerous precedent will have been set. This may make investors increasingly nervous about the likelihood of other highly-indebted nations, such as Italy, or those with weak economies, such as Spain, repaying their debts or even staying inside the euro. If investors stop buying bonds issued by other governments, then those governments in turn will not be able to repay their creditors - a potentially disastrous vicious circle. To combat this risk, European leaders have agreed a 700bn-euro firewall to protect the rest of the eurozone from a full-blown Greek default. Moreover, if banks in the weaker eurozone countries that are already struggling to find enough capital are forced to write off even more loans they have made - something that becomes more likely if the eurozone economy falls deeper into recession - they will become weaker still, undermining confidence in the entire banking system. Eurozone banks may then find it even hard to borrow, and therefore to lend, potentially sparking a second credit crunch, where bank lending effectively dries up, hurting the economy further. This problem would be exacerbated by savers and investors taking money out of banks in vulnerable economies, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, and moving it to banks in safer economies such as Germany or the Netherlands. These potential scenarios would be made immeasurably worse if Greece were to leave the euro. The country would almost certainly reintroduce the drachma, which would devalue dramatically and quickly, making it even harder for Greece to repay its debts, and setting an even worse precedent.

Greece was overspending, leading to a large budget deficit and hidden borrowings. This caused issues for the country when the global financial downturn occurred.

Q: Jordan is Cameron's financial adviser and is doing a really good job on his stocks. Given the context: What will Cameron want to do next? A:","completion":"Given the context, the next steps that Cameron might want to consider in order to continue benefiting from Jordan's expertise and maintain the growth of his investment portfolio are as follows: 1. Review and reassess financial goals: Cameron should set up a meeting with Jordan to review his current financial goals and determine if they are still in line with his overall objectives. This could include discussing retirement plans, saving for a big purchase, or funding his children’s education. 2. Diversify investments: If Cameron's current investments are heavily concentrated in a particular sector or industry, he may want to discuss diversifying his portfolio with Jordan. This involves investing in various asset classes and industries to minimize risk and maximize returns. Jordan can help Cameron identify opportunities in other sectors that align with his risk tolerance and financial goals. 3. Optimize tax strategy: Cameron should work with Jordan to optimize his tax strategy and take advantage of tax-saving opportunities. Jordan can help identify tax-efficient investment options, such as retirement accounts, tax-loss harvesting strategies or investing in municipal bonds. 4. Rebalance portfolio: Over time, Cameron's portfolio may become unbalanced due to market fluctuations and varying performance of different investments. Cameron should periodically speak with Jordan to assess whether his portfolio needs rebalancing to bring it back in line with his target asset allocation. 5. Monitor investment performance: Cameron should schedule regular meetings with Jordan to review the performance of his investments and discuss any necessary adjustments. This will ensure that his investment strategy remains effective and is making progress towards his financial goals. 6. Stay informed: For Cameron to be an active participant in his financial future, he should stay informed about the latest economic news, trends and market conditions. Jordan can help him understand the implications of these factors on his investments and provide advice on how to make informed decisions. 7. Plan for long-term financial goals: Cameron should work closely with Jordan to plan for his long-term financial goals, such as paying off his mortgage, saving for his children's education, and building a nest egg for retirement. By incorporating these goals into his investment strategy, he can set realistic targets and monitor his progress towards achieving them. 8. Consider estate planning: Cameron should discuss estate planning with Jordan to ensure his assets are distributed according to his wishes upon his death. This may involve creating a will, setting up trusts or designating beneficiaries for his investment accounts and insurance policies. 9. Regularly review fees and expenses: Cameron should periodically review the fees and expenses associated with his investment accounts to ensure they are reasonable and competitive. If necessary, Jordan can help him negotiate lower fees or recommend alternative investment options with lower costs. 10. Maintain open communication: To foster a strong working relationship with his financial adviser, Cameron should maintain open and honest communication with Jordan about his financial situation, goals, and concerns. This will allow Jordan to provide the most accurate and tailored advice possible, ultimately helping Cameron achieve his financial objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"Two people stand in front of a building with graffiti that reads \\"Boss Life\\".\\", is the sentence \\"The building was vandalized by a gang.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the sentence \\"Two people stand in front of a building with graffiti that reads \\"Boss Life\\".\\", we cannot definitively conclude that the sentence \\"The building was vandalized by a gang\\" is true. Firstly, it is important to consider the meaning of the term \\"vandalized\\". Vandalism typically refers to the deliberate act of damaging or destroying the property of others. In this instance, the graffiti might be considered as vandalism since it possibly involves the defacement of a building's exterior. Now, let's assess the possible associations between \\"Boss Life\\" graffiti and gang activity. The phrase \\"Boss Life\\" might or might not relate to gangs, as it does not explicitly reference any known gang symbols, names or slang. Moreover, graffiti can often include various elements, such as artistic expressions, political messages, and personal tags, which do not necessarily have any connection to criminal activity or gangs. Furthermore, the original sentence mentions two people standing in front of the building. Even if we assume that the people are somehow linked to the graffiti, it could be a result of numerous scenarios that involve activities ranging from street art to spontaneous writings by individuals unaffiliated with gangs. There is no concrete evidence to ascertain that these people are responsible for the graffiti, let alone being members of a gang. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"The building was vandalized by a gang\\" could be considered a plausible interpretation, it is not fully supported by the information provided within the original sentence. Other explanations, such as an individual artist or random passerby painting the graffiti, are equally plausible. To conclusively state the truth of the second sentence, more context, thorough investigation, and clear evidence would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"Lawyers disclosed everything their client had said.\\" This means that the lawyers shared all the information that their client communicated to them. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis The premise says that the White House lawyers invoked attorney-client privilege, which is a legal principle protecting the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. This is done so that the client can fully disclose information to their attorney without fearing that the information will be revealed to others. Step 4: Conclusion Since invoking attorney-client privilege implies that the lawyers acted to protect the confidentiality of their client's communications, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Lawyers disclosed everything their client had said.\\" is not true, as the lawyers did not disclose their client's communications due to the upheld privilege."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The young girl in the sex video that prompted the gang murder of an innocent Bronx teen has been receiving threatening messages on social media, a high-ranking police source said Monday. The 15-year-old girl is under NYPD police protection as a result of messages she’s gotten on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, the source said. Some refer to her as a “whore” and blame her for the death of Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz, who was dragged out of a bodega and hacked to death Wednesday by a group of five suspected Trinitarios gang members. Like Guzman-Feliz, the girl is enrolled in the NYPD Explorers program for youths interested in a career in law enforcement, the source added. Police believe Guzman-Feliz, 15, was the victim of mistaken identity. He resembles a young man who raps in a video that shows the girl having sex in the background. She’s believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios member. ||||| A bodega worker heartlessly gave the boot to mistaken-ID murder victim Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz as the desperate teen bled all over the store rather than offer him any aid, according to newly released video footage. In the first of two clips that emerged Tuesday, Guzman-Feliz, 15, enters the Cruz and Chiky grocery on East 183rd Street near Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx last Wednesday night and jumps behind the counter in an attempt to hide from the Trinitarios gangbangers who would soon hack him to death with knives and a machete. He struggles with a worker in a blue shirt, who puts his arm out to stop the frightened teen — but Guzman-Feliz manages to scramble behind the counter. The second video — made seconds after Guzman-Feliz was stabbed outside the bodega — shows him staggering back into the store and past two men. The teen leaves a trail of blood on the floor as he heaves himself up on the counter, apparently seeking help for his mortal wounds. But the callous bodega worker can be seen jumping backward and then motioning toward the front door. Guzman-Feliz seems to comply, by promptly stumbling back outside. It is unclear what was said, ­because the videos lack sound. Guzman-Feliz’s left hand smears a pool of blood left on the counter as he leaves. A previously released clip from exterior surveillance shows the teen then exiting the deli and throwing his hands up in the air in exasperation. He limped a block to St. Barnabas Hospital, but collapsed on the sidewalk steps away. The worker watched the boy grow up over the years only to let him die before his very eyes, grieving mom Leandra Feliz said. “They know him! We live here 17 year, [the owner] knows him,” she said over the weekend. “He pushed him like, ‘Take him! Take it outside!’ Before the killers get in, my son was hiding inside the store. He [had] time to lock the door or call police or something. He did nothing.” Outrage at the bodega hit a fever pitch Tuesday as a trio of local lawmakers demanded that the place be shuttered. “An owner who stands idly by while a 15-year-old is dragged out of his store and murdered in cold blood with a machete is no long­er worthy of doing business in NYC,” reads a letter City Council members Ritchie Torres, Vanessa Gibson and Rafael Salamanca sent to the Department of Consumer Affairs Commissioner Lorelai Salas on Monday, demanding that the agency shutter the store, formerly known in the neighborhood as Zesarina Grocery. The council members sent a similar letter to the State Liquor Authority demanding that it pull the bodega’s license to sell booze. “I saw video where the owner was engaged in business as usual right after Junior ran frantically in the store,” Torres told the Post Tuesday. “He continued to engage in a business transact with Junior’s blood right in front of him.” The owner did, however, call 911, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea confirmed during a press conference Tuesday. Community members have ripped the owner and those inside the store that night for seemingly doing nothing to help save Guzman-Feliz as gang members dragged him out. The bodega owner, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has been getting death threats since the slaying and has kept his business closed, a police source said. The deli owner could not be reached for comment, and the SLA did not respond to requests for comment. “We are reviewing the letter. No general business license exists in ­local law,” said DCA spokeswoman Gloria Chin.

Mourners filled the streets in the Bronx Monday, frustrated with the violence that cost 15-year-old Lesandro Guzman-Feliz his life. According to a relative, the gang believed to be responsible admitted on social media it had attacked the wrong person, reports CBS News' DeMarco Morgan. They reportedly thought he had leaked a sex tape of one of the gang members' relatives. The teen's family said an apology is not enough. They want justice. Guzman-Feliz – known as Junior – was beaten and stabbed repeatedly by five men and was able to walk himself to a nearby hospital after the attack, where he died. His father, Lesandro Guzman, rushed home from a job in Florida when he learned about the attack. \\"I miss him. I miss him a lot. I don't know what happens tomorrow, but I miss him,\\" Guzman said. The gruesome murder is mobilizing the community in the streets and online, under the new hashtag \\"Justice for Junior.\\" Police used social media to solicit tips and were flooded with information, which reportedly helped identify multiple suspects, including their names, locations, and gang affiliations. All of Guzman-Feliz's suspected attackers are alleged members of a gang know as the \\"Trinitarios.\\" Family members believe the incident was a case of mistaken identity and claim the gang even apologized to them on social media. \\"No sorry, no apologize is going to bring my son back. He was a good and sweet kid,\\" Leandra Feliz, his mother, said. The slain teen's parents say he dreamed of becoming a detective and was part of the NYPD Explorers, a program for high school students. New York police commissioner James O'Neill was at his wake along with hundreds of others. \\"I'm very thankful for the support from everybody. Makes me feel like sure my son gonna have justice,\\" Feliz said. A GoFundMe page set up for Guzman-Feliz's family has raised 240,000. Local rapper Cardi B donated 8,000 to the fund. Another wake service is scheduled for the teen on Tuesday night. His funeral is planned for Wednesday. ||||| The 15-year-old New York City teen who died last week after being brutally hacked with a machete outside a deli went into the store after the attack to seek help – but instead was denied medical assistance and was asked to leave, a disturbing new video shows. Graphic surveillance footage posted online – which is drawing widespread outrage Tuesday on social media – captures the sequence of events inside the Zesarina Grocery store in the Bronx last Wednesday before and after Lesandro Guzman-Feliz was attacked. Police have since arrested seven men in connection to the gang-related killing. The clip begins with Guzman-Feliz entering the deli to escape the attackers, who police believe targeted him in a case of mistaken identity. A police source told the New York Post on Monday that Guzman-Feliz resembled a young man seen rapping in a video that shows a girl – believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios gang member – having sex in the background. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW A post shared by 🤴🏽Robert 🌈Williams🦁 (@areumdawo_saja) on Jun 25, 2018 at 11:00pm PDT As Guzman-Feliz jumps onto the counter, he appears to be met with resistance by a worker behind the cash register. The worker eventually lets the teen onto the other side before the two walk off camera. Then the suspected attackers come into the store and drag Guzman-Feliz outside, where he was savagely hacked with a machete and left to die with blood gushing out of a neck wound. Shortly after the attack, the footage shows Guzman-Feliz coming back into the store to seek assistance. As he slumps over the counter, the worker behind it appears to jump back and refuses to come to his aid. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW An apparent customer who was inside the store the entire time is also seen gesturing for the teen to leave, pointing toward the door. Guzman-Feliz walks out. Then, in one of the video’s most shocking moments, the customer reaches over a pool of Guzman-Feliz’s blood to complete a transaction that got put on hold during the attack, handing the worker what appears to be cash before getting an item back in response. The customer then throws a backpack over his shoulder and leaves the store, following Guzman-Feliz’s trail of blood out the door, while the worker is pictured making a phone call. The teen died shortly afterward, steps away from nearby St. Barnabas Hospital. \\"This just makes my blood boil,\\" one Instagram user wrote next to the footage. \\"The murderers came into the store and was still able to drag the boy out the bodega with nobody helping him. To [make] matters worse HE CAME BACK INTO THE BODEGA!! Bleeding… after the attack and nobody helped him!!!” “They treated him like an animal. My heart breaks for this poor boy his family and friend,” another user reacted on Twitter. New York City police so far have charged 19-year-old Kevin Alvarez of the Bronx with murder and gang assault in relation to the killing. Six other suspects taken into custody over the weekend in Paterson, N.J. -- identified as Jose Muniz, 21, Jose Tavarez, 21, Manuel Rivera, 18, Danel Fernandez, 21, Santiago Rodriguez, 24 and Joniki Martinez, 24 -- waived their right to contest extradition at a hearing on Tuesday, Fox 5 NY reported. They are expected to be arraigned on Wednesday in Bronx Criminal Court. All the men are suspected Trinitarios gang members. Meanwhile, more than a thousand people reportedly turned out Monday for Guzman-Feliz’s wake. The teen, who aspired to become a New York City police detective, was also memorialized in a tattoo on his father’s hand. “My heart is broken, really broken,” Lissandro Guzman told the New York Post. “He’s my son, but he’s also like my best friend.” NBA star Carmelo Anthony was among those to appear Monday at a makeshift memorial of candles and photographs outside the deli, which has been shuttered since the killing.

Henry VI, elected King of the Romans since 1169, succeeded his father Frederick and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Celestine III in 1191. In his struggle with the Princes to enforce his succession, the tide turned in his favour when the returning crusader King Richard was captured in Austria and only released against an oath of allegiance and an enormous ransom. In 1194 Henry could assert the inheritance claims of his wife Constance by conquering the Kingdom of Sicily. By declaring a new Crusade to reconquer Jerusalem, Henry aimed at an agreement with Pope Celestine III to acknowledge his rule over Sicily. In 1195 the armistice concluded by King Richard ended. Sultan Saladin had already died in 1193 and a conflict over his succession raged in the Ayyubid lands. In view of these favourable developments, the emperor hoped to continue the momentum of the previous campaign.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the word \\"draw\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? At the start of their turn, each player must draw a card. The session was drawn to a close.","completion":"No, the word \\"draw\\" does not have the same definition in these two sentences. Although they both use the same word, \\"draw\\" has multiple meanings in the English language, and in this case, it is utilized in different contexts. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. In the first sentence: \\"At the start of their turn, each player must draw a card.\\" In this context, \\"draw\\" refers to taking or selecting something (a card, in this case) from a set, container, or in a game. When referring to games, such as card games or board games, \\"drawing\\" typically means that a player removes a card from a deck or a tile from a pile, and adds it to their hand or play area. The action of selecting, taking or picking up a new card during a game is the fundamental idea behind \\"draw\\" in this sentence. 2. In the second sentence: \\"The session was drawn to a close.\\" Here, \\"draw\\" has an entirely different meaning, as it refers to bringing something (in this case, the session) to an end or closing point. Rather than the aforementioned idea of selecting or taking something, \\"draw\\" in this context is associated with the gradual movement towards a conclusion, an end of an event or an approaching deadline. It functions as a way to convey the idea of reaching the finality of something, such as an event or process. So, these two sentences demonstrate distinct uses for the word \\"draw,\\" with the first referring to selecting a card, while the second involves moving towards the completion of an event. The different meanings arise from the diverse contexts in which \\"draw\\" is used, highlighting the flexibility and richness of the English language."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This diet also claims that it will help you lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in the first 2 weeks, so Atkins is a great plan if you are hoping to drop a large amount of weight quickly. The South Beach diet was developed by a cardiologist and it claims to help you develop a healthier way of eating while also promoting weight loss. Also, the South Beach diet does not restrict carbs as intensely as some other diets, so it may be easier to follow and stick with it. This diet plan focuses on getting your daily intake to 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbs. This will force your body to use fat for energy and promote quick weight loss. A ketogenic diet has long been known as beneficial for people with epilepsy. However, following the diet may also help to prevent Alzheimer’s, stroke, dementia, and traumatic brain injury. Some people experience negative side effects as they transition to a very low-carb diet, such as brain fog, fatigue, and moodiness. The Dukan diet is one of the most structured low-carb diets, which some people find helpful. In the first 10 days of this diet, you only eat lean protein, oat bran, and water. After that you can include non-starchy veggies, a serving of fruit, a serving of whole grain, and hard cheeses. You may lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more in the first couple of weeks, and then about 2 pounds (0.91 kg) to 4 pounds (1.8 kg) pounds after that. Keep in mind that any time a diet has a lot of restrictions, you are at risk of nutritional deficiencies. You cannot have any dairy, grains, potatoes, or processed foods on this diet, but you can eat lots of meat, veggies, roots, fruits, and nuts. The whole foods approach of this diet is healthy and you will get to eat plenty of food to stay full and satisfied. The goal of the Paleo diet attributes many of the health issues people have today, including obesity, with the modern agricultural diet that includes dairy and grains. Summary:","completion":"This article talks about different low-carb diets that help people lose weight and become healthier. The Atkins diet can help you lose a lot of weight quickly. The South Beach diet is good for a healthier way of eating and doesn't limit carbs too much. The ketogenic diet is good for people with epilepsy and may help prevent some brain diseases, but it can have some side effects. The Dukan diet is very structured and can help you lose weight too.

The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \\"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\\" Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions.

Summarize: Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven, 46, were convicted of arson in 2012 but a court ruled their original sentences were too short. The Hammonds' lawyer has said that the family does not want the protesters' support, according to CBS News. The case has riled right-wing activists who resent government interference. They said they lit fires on federal land to combat invasive species and protect their land from wildfires. Those occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge centre in Burns say they plan to stay for years and may use violence if police try to evict them. Local police said \\"outside militants\\" had seized the building, and that multiple agencies were working on a solution, the Oregonian reported. Among those there is Ammon Bundy, whose father Cliven was involved in a stand-off with the government over grazing rights in 2014. Speaking to CNN, Mr Ammon made no specific demands but said the action was aimed at helping locals \\"claim back their lands and resources\\". He said that the wildlife refuge had expanded at the expense of ranchers and miners. The incident is part of a decades-old conflict between ranchers and the federal government over the use of public land. Critics of the federal government say it often oversteps its authority over land use. On Saturday an unknown number of men took over the bird sanctuary on a snowy desert plain in Oregon. There is no sign of police officers and there has been no violence or negotiations. The militia men who seized the complex say they are prepared to stay for years. They have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west; rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority. The FBI said it was aware of the occupation and the sheriff has urged people to stay away from the building, saying multiple agencies were working on a solution. In an interview with the Associated Press news agency, Ammon Bundy's brother, Ryan Bundy, said the protesters' ultimate goal was to turn the land over to local authorities so that people can use it free of federal oversight. \\"I understand the land needs to be used wisely, but that's what we as stewards need to do. A rancher is going to take care of his own ranch,\\" he added. But despite the protest Dwight Hammond says he and his son plan to report peacefully to prison on Monday. His lawyers told Associated Press \\"neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organisation speak for the Hammond Family\\". Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward was critical of the protesters and their motives. \\"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States,\\" Mr Ward said in a statement.

The 34-year-old of Derby spent two days in the city where a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Power Station exploded on April 26, 1986. During the accident itself, 31 people died and it has left devastating long term effects, such as cancer and deformities, which are still being accounted for. Mr Batchelor said: 'Each day when leaving the area you had to be scanned for high levels of radioactivity.

Desks and chairs lie in disarray, as if frozen in time, while textbooks and other materials have been left to decay over the years. The city, once bustling with life, now stands as a ghost town, with eerie silence enveloping the abandoned buildings. In his photographs, Toby Batchelor captures the desolation and despair that hang heavy in the air, a testament to the magnitude of the disaster. Vegetation has started to reclaim the city, adding to the haunting atmosphere and displaying nature's resilience amidst the devastation. It is a chilling reminder of the potential dangers of nuclear power and the lasting impact it can have on communities when things go wrong. Despite the severity of the catastrophe, Pripyat has become an unlikely tourist destination for those interested in exploring the site of the nuclear disaster. Tour groups are guided through the area, adhering to strict safety precautions, allowing them a glimpse into the chilling past of the doomed city. For many, it serves as a stark warning of the risks associated with nuclear technology and the importance of prioritizing safety measures. Yet, even as the world bears witness to the long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster, the cleanup process continues at a slow pace. Thousands of workers operate under challenging conditions, with the dangers of radiation exposure still very much present, in an effort to contain the contamination and restore some sense of normalcy to the area. No one can truly know the full extent of the impact that the Chernobyl disaster will have on generations to come, but the harrowing images captured by Toby Batchelor remind us of the tragic consequences that can result from failing to protect the environment and the communities we live in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context: De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

He was an American film director who began his career in the 1950s and was known for his work in feature films and television. Miller directed more than a dozen films spanning over four decades, including \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,\\" \\"Reuben, Reuben,\\" and \\"Sweet November.\\" On the other hand, Trey Parker, whose full name is Randolph Severn \\"Trey\\" Parker III, was born later, on October 19, 1969.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source, Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.

In both cases, the subject, presumably a man, is relocating. However, the order of the cities and the timing of when he moved to them is different in each statement, which changes the meaning significantly. In the first statement: \\"He moved to Attika, Indiana in 1853, and in 1859 to Bloomington, Illinois.\\" This tells us that the man moved to Attika, Indiana first, specifically in the year 1853. Then, approximately six years later, in 1859, he moved again, this time to Bloomington, Illinois. This information is sequential and puts his relocation to Attika, Indiana before his time in Bloomington, Illinois. This directly impacts any events or experiences he might have had in each place, his relationship to each place, and how we understand his timeline and story. In contrast, the second statement: \\"He moved to Bloomington, Illinois in 1853, and in 1859 to Attika, Indiana.\\" This tells a very different story. In this scenario, the man moved to Bloomington, Illinois first in 1853, which is then followed by a move to Attika, Indiana in 1859. This swaps the order of the relocation events compared to the first statement, moving his time in Bloomington, Illinois to before his time in Attika, Indiana. As with the first statement, this directly influences his experiences, relationship to each city, and how we track his timeline and story. Therefore, despite both sentences discussing the same man and the same two cities, the difference in timing and order of the moves leads to two divergent narratives and meanings, they are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"The statement \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" is a simplified answer. To provide a detailed and long answer, we need to delve into the history of ancient Greece. The Ancient Greek world was primarily composed of city-states or \\"poleis\\" that were relatively independent from each other, and many conflicts occurred between these city-states throughout history. While it is challenging to give an exact number of successive civil wars that occurred among Greek clans, there are a few significant examples that shed light on the nature of conflict among the ancient Greeks. While the term \\"civil war\\" might not be an accurate representation of the Greek poleis' conflicts, the Peloponnesian War offers a broad context for the rivalries and tensions among Greek clans. The Peloponnesian War (431 – 404 BCE) was a series of conflicts between the Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. It comprised two main phases, separated by a brief period of peace: 1. Archidamian War (431 – 421 BCE): This phase of war was named after the Spartan king Archidamus II. It began in 431 BCE when the Thebans attacked the city-state of Plataea, an ally of Athens. The war continued for a decade and ended with the Peace of Nicias, a treaty signed in 421 BCE between Athens and Sparta. However, the peace did not last long. 2. The Decelean War or Ionian War (413 – 404 BCE): The second phase of the Peloponnesian War followed the failed Sicilian Expedition by the Athenians, during which their navy was virtually destroyed. With increased support from Persia, the Spartans managed to defeat the Athenian Empire, and in 404 BCE, Athens was forced to surrender. Apart from the Peloponnesian War, other examples of conflict among Greek clans include: 1. The First Sacred War (594 – 585 BCE): This war was fought between the Amphictyonic League, a religious federation of ancient Greek tribes, and the city of Kirra. The cause of the war was Kirra's alleged piracy and impiety against the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The conflict ended with the destruction of Kirra. 2. The Lelantine War (circa 700 – 650 BCE): This war was fought between the city-states of Chalcis and Eretria over control of the fertile Lelantine Plain, located in Euboea. This war was significant because it involved most of the important poleis of the time, including Athens, Corinth, and Samos, testing their alliances and rivalries. Given the complexity of the historical context and the numerous wars and conflicts in Ancient Greece, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number of successive civil wars between Greek clans. The answer provided in the statement is an oversimplification of the historical events and conflicts that took place among ancient Greek factions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This conclusion can be drawn from several key elements within the review. First, the reviewer opens their statement with \\"Wow. This is really not that good,\\" which clearly indicates a negative sentiment. This phrase speaks volumes about the reviewer’s disappointment or dissatisfaction with whatever they are reviewing. The use of the word \\"really\\" is an intensifier and suggests an even greater level of negativity or disappointment. Second, the reviewer states \\"I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good…it is, but it is nothing special.\\" The transitional phrase \\"I would like to agree\\" might initially suggest the reviewer is about to present a positive sentiment, but they immediately counteract this by insisting that the acting is \\"nothing special.\\" This downplays the seeming positivity of the compliment and shifts focus back to a negative perspective. Lastly, the reviewer says \\"The movie is so predictable and I for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies.\\" The term \\"predictable\\" is generally used in a negative context when critiquing films, as it suggests a lack of originality or creativity. Furthermore, the expression of being \\"sick\\" of a certain aspect also illustrates their dissatisfaction. Lastly, the rating \\"/****\\" places a stark point on the overall negative sentiment. Without a clear numerical value provided, it's assumed that this symbol represents a low score. Hence, collectively these factors point to a negative review, showing dissatisfaction and a lack of enthusiasm towards the movie.

Which former bandleader was married to Ava Gardner and Lana Turner What is the answer?","completion":"The former bandleader who was married to both Ava Gardner and Lana Turner was Artie Shaw. Artie Shaw, born Arthur Jacob Arshawsky on May 23, 1910, in New York City, gained prominence as a big band leader, jazz clarinetist, and composer during the swing era of the 1930s and 1940s. Shaw was the leader of one of the most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Artie Shaw was married eight times in his life, with his spouses including some of Hollywood's most famous actresses. In 1945, he married the stunning Ava Gardner, who at the time was an up-and-coming actress. Gardner eventually became one of the most celebrated actresses in Hollywood, renowned for her roles in films like \\"The Barefoot Contessa\\" (1954) and \\"Mogambo\\" (1953). Their marriage was short-lived, as they divorced in 1946. Before marrying Ava Gardner, Artie Shaw had been married to Hollywood actress Lana Turner, whose notable films include \\"Peyton Place\\" (1957), \\"The Bad and the Beautiful\\" (1952), and \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1946). Turner was known as one of the most glamorous screen icons of the era and later gained recognition for her personal life and scandals. Artie Shaw married Lana Turner in 1940, but like his marriage to Gardner, it was a short-lived union, and they divorced in 1940 itself. In addition to Ava Gardner and Lana Turner, Artie Shaw was married to several other women over the years, including stars such as Doris Dowling, Evelyn Keyes, and actress-author Kathleen Winsor. Artie Shaw passed away on December 30, 2004, at the age of 94, leaving behind a rich musical legacy and a fascinating personal life marked by numerous high-profile marriages and relationships."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: \\"God is a Bullet\\" would make a hell of an Action Movie.

Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. The Book of Jonah (Yonah yvnh) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings 17. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4 and that he is called the \\"son of Amittai\\" (Truth) due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in 2 Kings 17:24. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination. According to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcized, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive. Teshuva - the ability to repent and be forgiven by God - is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \\"Amitai\\" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \\"fasting, including the sheep,\\" and the Jewish scripts are critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Can you provide more insight into the significance of reading the Book of Jonah during Yom Kippur and its connection to the theme of repentance and forgiveness?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Electricity is a physical phenomenon associated with the presence of electric charge. Although initially considered a phenomenon separate to magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's Equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon:electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In addition, electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an \\"exporter\\" and is based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an \\"importer\\". In international trade, \\"exports\\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home country to other markets. - Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during an electrical storm. This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a \\"strike\\" if it hits an object on the ground, and a flash, if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of plasma, and sound in the form of thunder. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - ALMANAC is the name of a major breast cancer trial.

There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization.

My baby is 1 month and is almost too big for the table. Don't buy it! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review clearly illustrates the product in an unflattering light. The dissatisfaction of the reviewer can be analyzed through multiple aspects of their experience, which we will break down below: 1. Inadequate dimensions: The reviewer complains about the product's design, specifically addressing that the changing table is not long enough for their baby. They initially assumed that the table would be suitable for babies up to the age of 3 years, but their 1-month-old already seems almost too big for it. This concern mainly indicates user dissatisfaction with the size and functionality of the product. 2. Disappointment in the product choice: By stating, \\"Don't buy it!\\" the reviewer is explicitly discouraging potential customers from purchasing this particular changing table. This negative recommendation underlines the unflattering portrayal of the product. 3. Lack of attention to details: The reviewer acknowledges that they bought the product without looking at the dimensions, which suggests that they might not have been fully informed before their purchase. However, this part of their experience is not necessarily a reflection of the product's quality itself but rather an aspect of the consumer's decision-making process. Despite this acknowledgment, the review as a whole maintains an unfavorable depiction of the changing table. In conclusion, the product review presents a significantly unflattering portrayal of the changing table. The main issue lies in the dimensions, which seem insufficient to accommodate a growing baby. Coupled with the reviewer's clear disappointment and unambiguous advice against purchasing the product, the overall impression is overwhelmingly negative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The mule never looked happy.\\"?","completion":"In order to determine if the premise \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face\\" truly entails the hypothesis \\"The mule never looked happy,\\" we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements and evaluate their implications. The Premise: \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.\\" This premise provides information about a particular situation in which Anse observes the mule's facial expression as being melancholic. The key term here is \\"melancholy,\\" which, by definition, refers to a feeling of sadness or a gloomy state of mind. Therefore, in this specific instance, the mule appears sad or unhappy. The Hypothesis: \\"The mule never looked happy.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis takes the information from the premise and makes a broader generalization, stating that the mule never appears happy. The conclusive nature of the word \\"never\\" implies a sense of permanence, suggesting that the mule is incapable of exhibiting a happy or content demeanor. One singular observation of the mule looking melancholic, as mentioned in the premise, does not necessarily mean that the mule has not looked or cannot look happy in some other instances. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements and evaluate their implications. The premise does not exclusively confirm the hypothesis, as it only provides a snapshot of one particular situation. It is possible that in other instances, the mule has looked happy, but we are unable to determine this based solely on the given premise. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the two statements, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. It is important to recognize that a single instance of an observation does not automatically lead to drawing a conclusive or generalized claim. In order to support the hypothesis, additional evidence or instances of the mule's demeanor would be needed. For instance, if multiple situations were described where the mule consistently appeared unhappy or sad, perhaps then there may be stronger grounds to support the hypothesis. However, with the given information, we cannot confirm that \\"The mule never looked happy\\" based on the single observation presented in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rodeos often involve events such as bull riding or bronco riding (both in the case of saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding). So, it is not specifically mentioned whether the cowboy is on a bull or a bronco. With this information, it is not possible to logically conclude that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" While it is certainly a possibility in the scenario described, there is no definitive evidence in the statement to conclude it with certainty. It could also be the case that the cowboy is riding a bronco or is successful in staying on the bull or bronco for the entire 8 seconds or more. There are different potential outcomes in this scenario: 1. The cowboy stays on the bull for more than 8 seconds, successfully completing the objective and not getting bucked off. 2. The cowboy is bucked off the bull before the 8 seconds have passed. 3. The cowboy is participating in a bronco riding event instead of bull riding, making it impossible for him to be bucked off a bull in that particular event.

Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach (German: \\"Marie Hedwig Auguste von Sulzbach\\" ; born: 15 April 1650 in Sulzbach; died: 23 November 1681 in Hamburg) was a Countess Palatine of Sulzbach by birth and by marriage, Archduchess of Austria and by her second marriage, Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg. Can we draw the following conclusion? Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children. [i] Yes [ii] It's impossible to say [iii] No","completion":"[iii] No It is not accurate to draw the conclusion that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children based solely on the provided information. To assess her role as a mother, it is essential to examine her marriages and any offspring that resulted from those unions. Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had two marriages during her lifetime. Her first marriage was to Archduke Ferdinand Maria of Austria on 30 June 1662. This union produced one surviving daughter, Theresia Kunigunde (1665-1670), who died at a young age. However, this is a clear indication that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had at least one child in her lifetime. Marie Hedwig Auguste's second marriage was to Julius Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, on 9 April 1668. They had two surviving daughters: Anna Maria Theresia (1670-1670), who passed away shortly after birth, and Maria Anna Carolina (1672-1672), who also died during infancy. Although both children did not survive beyond their early years, this evidence further confirms that Marie Hedwig Auguste did have children in her lifetime. Based on her marriages and the children that resulted from them, it is incorrect to conclude that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children. Instead, it is reasonable to assert that she had three children, though tragically, none of them survived into adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul.

The entire family is still mourning the tragic loss of Oskar's father, Daniel, who lost his life during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Despite the passing of time, Oskar cannot shake the feeling that there might be more to his father's story than what he knows. Oskar often finds solace in a hidden box of mementoes under his bed that belonged to his father.

The writer, named Richard, leaves cryptic instructions - a clue revealing the existence of a safety deposit box in Manhattan. Oskar becomes determined to unearth the truth behind his father's death and understand the significance of the discovered items. Act Two Against his mother's wishes, Oskar secretly sets out on a journey to New York City to unlock the secrets of Daniel's life. His investigation leads him to the safety deposit box, which contains a series of letters, photographs, and other keepsakes. It quickly becomes apparent that Daniel, a financial analyst, was not the person he claimed to be.

Background: Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer Mike Browning. Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Context: Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\" In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that: Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics. Question: Who were the members of the band? Answer:","completion":"Morbid Angel is a music group formed in Tampa, Florida in 1983. They play a type of music called death metal. The people who started the band were a guitarist named Trey Azagthoth, a singer and bass player named Dallas Ward, and a drummer named Mike Browning. Later, more people joined the group, such as David Vincent, who became the new singer and bass player, and Pete Sandoval, who became the new drummer.

Carl Gustav Jung (; German: [karl jUNG]; 26 July 1875 - 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. His work has been influential not only in psychiatry but also in anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. As a notable research scientist based at the famous Burgholzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler, he came to the attention of the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842-1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848-1923). Their first child, born in 1873, was a boy named Paul who survived only a few days. Being the youngest son of a noted Basel physician of German descent, also called Karl Gustav Jung (1794-1864), whose hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, Paul Jung did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church; his wife had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799-1871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was antistes, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University. When Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen, but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night. Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father. Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women--one of \\"innate unreliability\\". This was a view that he later called the \\"handicap I started off with\\". He believed it contributed to his sometimes patriarchal views of women, but these were common in the society of his time. After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer; he was called to Kleinhuningen, next to Basel in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884-1935) was born. Known in the family as \\"Trudi\\", she later became a secretary to her brother.

The Emirates team, under the leadership of British skipper Walker, emerged victorious. This victory marks an especially notable achievement for Walker, who not only participated in his third round-the-world race but also became the first British skipper ever to overall win the trophy. The article mentions the performance of all the teams involved in this world race. Specifically, Team Alvimedica won the final leg of the race, leaving only one team out of the seven-strong fleet without a stage win.

The Swedish boat, led by Briton Sam Davies, was the only team entirely composed of females in the race, a representation that wasn't seen for the past 10 years. The oceanic race, sailed using a single-design Volvo Ocean 65 boat, was fraught with numerous challenges and unforeseen circumstances. The teams visited 11 ports across every continent and faced a series of dramatic incidents such as shipwrecks and extreme weather. For example, Team Vestas Wind had a near-fatal accident when they crashed onto a remote coral reef surrounded by shark-infested waters during the second leg from Cape Town to Abu Dhabi. Consequently, they missed five legs as their boat had to be reconstructed. Moreover, the race organizers had to establish an ice exclusion zone after spotting an enormous iceberg, and the teams also experienced severe storms leading to mast breakages. Despite the tumultuous journey, Walker reflects on the race positively, emphasizing the sense of camaraderie and deep bonds formed during such enduring shared experiences. He applauds every crew member's achievement and relishes the uniqueness of their trans-global sailing navigation.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer has been a longstanding choice for many users, but as with any software, it is not immune to bugs and glitches. Recently, Microsoft issued a temporary software fix for a bug in its Internet Explorer web browser, aimed at ensuring user safety and seamless browsing experience. In this article, we will explore the details of this software fix, the potential impact on users and businesses, and future steps for browser security. Microsoft's Internet Explorer Bug and Its Impact The bug in question has the potential to cause significant disruption for users and remain a security threat, especially since Internet Explorer continues to be widely used despite being replaced by Microsoft Edge as the company's primary browser. A vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious code on a user's computer can lead to major security breaches and potentially compromise a user's sensitive personal information. As users and businesses depend on their web browsers for a multitude of tasks ranging from online shopping and banking to collaboration and project management, a secure and reliable browser is essential. This bug could impact countless users worldwide, potentially exposing their personal and financial information to cyberattacks. In the worst-case scenario, it could lead to identity theft or unauthorized access to organizational data. Temporary Software Fix and Future Implications Acknowledging the severity of this bug, Microsoft has swiftly released a temporary software fix that users can apply to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability. While this solution provides some relief from potential security threats and disruption, it is crucial to note that it is a temporary measure. In the long run, Microsoft will need to address the vulnerability by developing and deploying a permanent fix for the browser. This process could take some time, as pinpointing the source of the problem and implementing a lasting solution requires thorough evaluation and testing. Users and businesses should be aware of this interim solution and continue to monitor updates from Microsoft on the progress of a permanent resolution. In the meantime, as Internet Explorer is gradually being phased out in favor of Microsoft Edge, users are encouraged to make the transition to the newer browser for improved security and performance. Microsoft Edge offers additional features and employs a more secure architecture to provide a safer browsing experience, which can potentially alleviate the risks posed by vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. Final Thoughts This recent incident underscores the importance of timely detection and remediation of software bugs and vulnerabilities. As technology continues to evolve, cyber threats are becoming more advanced and widespread. It is crucial for both individuals and organizations to prioritize their online security by staying informed, applying patches and updates, and using the latest and most secure software available. The temporary fix for the Internet Explorer bug serves as a cautionary reminder – users should remain vigilant about the software they use and ensure that they apply any available updates to minimize risks associated with vulnerabilities. By doing so, they can protect their sensitive information and maintain a safer browsing experience in an increasingly interconnected digital world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The constellation named after the mother of the legendary Greek princess Andromeda is Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia is a prominent northern constellation that is easily recognizable due to its distinctive W-shaped pattern formed by its five brightest stars. This constellation is named in honor of the mythical Greek queen Cassiopeia, who was the wife of King Cepheus and the mother of Princess Andromeda. According to Greek mythology, Cassiopeia was a vain and boastful woman who claimed that both she and her daughter were more beautiful than the Nereids, the sea nymphs who were the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This act of hubris angered the sea god Poseidon, who decided to punish Cassiopeia and her kingdom. Poseidon sent a sea monster, known as Cetus, to wreak havoc along the coastline of the kingdom. In an attempt to appease Poseidon and save their kingdom, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia consulted an oracle, who advised them to sacrifice their daughter Andromeda to the sea monster. Andromeda was then chained to a rock by the sea as an offering to Cetus. However, she was eventually rescued by the hero Perseus, who slew the sea monster and married Andromeda. In the sky, the constellation Cassiopeia is surrounded by other constellations that represent the characters of this myth. Adjacent to Cassiopeia is the constellation Cepheus, which represents King Cepheus. Nearby, the constellation Andromeda represents the princess herself, while the constellations Perseus and Cetus symbolize the hero and the sea monster, respectively. This celestial grouping of constellations effectively tells the story of the mythological tale, serving as a reminder of the ancient Greek story. Cassiopeia, along with the other constellations in this group, is part of the Perseus family of constellations. The constellation is visible throughout the year in the northern hemisphere, particularly during the autumn months. The brightest star in the constellation is Schedar, followed by Caph, which form the two ends of the W-shape. Apart from its mythology, Cassiopeia is also an interesting constellation for astronomers due to the various celestial objects it contains, such as star clusters, galaxies, and supernova remnants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Experiences in life teach us new lessons and make us a better person. With each passing day we learn to handle various situations. Love Love plays a pivotal role on out life. Love makes you feel wanted. Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect. Here it becomes very important to keep our head on out shoulder. The only way to show our gratitude to god for bestowing success on us is by being humble, modest, courteous and respectful to the less fortunate ones. Hope and despair Hope is what keeps life going. Parents always hope their children will do well. Hope makes us dream. Hope builds in patience. Life teaches us not to despair even in the darkest hour, because after every night there is a day. Nothing remains the same we have only one choice keep moving on in life and be hopeful. Life teaches us not to regret over yesterday, for it has passed and is beyond our...

Here is a premise: In the case of Japan, there is a compelling intellectual case for a recovery strategy based on the deliberate creation of managed inflation. Here is a hypothesis: Japan used a recovery strategy that involved creating managed inflation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze this, we'll break it down step by step. 1. Firstly, acknowledging the premise: The premise states that in Japan, a compelling intellectual case can be made for a recovery strategy that involves the creation of managed inflation. 2. Understanding the premise: This means that theoretically, the grounds for using managed inflation as a recovery strategy in Japan are considered strong. It doesn't state, however, that Japan has implemented this strategy, but that arguments can be made in favor of it. 3. Secondly, recognizing the hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that Japan has used a recovery strategy involving the creation of managed inflation. 4. Analyzing the relationship: If we look at the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we see they're talking about the same strategy - managed inflation as a recovery method - but they differ in the \\"reality\\" status. The premise talks of a theoretical application, whereas the hypothesis states it as a factual occurrence. 5. Conclusion: So, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise only argues that a compelling case could be made for the strategy, not that the strategy has been implemented. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the strategy has already been used. Given this, we cannot infer the truth of the hypothesis directly from the premise. To do so, we would need additional information that confirms Japan indeed implemented such a recovery strategy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It will mean pre-school children with moderate to severe learning difficulties will attend school for 2.5 hours instead of at least 4.5 hours a day. The cut was revealed by the Education Authority (EA) in a letter to a parent. It confirms that from September 2016 \\"all pre-school children will receive 2.5 hours in pre-school per day\\". The EA said the move \\"is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places,\\" and will provide \\"greater regional consistency\\". However, a body that represents special school principals and governors said the cut will \\"hold back and restrict the development of children with complex needs\\". In a submission to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Strategic Leadership Forum for Special Schools (SLFSS) said they \\"totally disagree\\" with the move. They said it will have a range of impacts including: Francine Wilson's three-year-old son Aodhan, is due to start pre-school at a special school in September. \\"Aodhan has Down's Syndrome and we were hoping in September 2016 he would get five hours of nursery placement,\\" she said. \\"Receiving two and a half hours will, I believe, result in delayed development in Aodhan, both educationally and socially.\\" However, a spokesperson for the EA said the reduction was \\"in line with the Department of Education's 'Learning to Learn' policy\\". \\"There has been a progressive move towards part-time places in all sectors,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"This policy recognises the research evidence that there is no discernible difference in children's development at the start of primary school between those who received part-time and full-time pre-school provision. \\"This move is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places, preferably nearer to their homes.\\" \\"The provision of increased access and greater regional consistency is a priority,\\" they added. Summary:","completion":"Starting in September, special schools in Northern Ireland will reduce the school day for pre-school children with learning difficulties. Instead of being at school for 4.5 hours, they will only be at school for 2.5 hours. This change will affect all 39 special schools.

But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man. Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy. His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem. Readers ride his characteristic rhythm with an effortless joy that cannot be matched by any other modern writer: You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed! Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed. Seuss's brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course. His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways. The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax, written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s. Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \\"who speaks for the trees\\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \\"which everyone needs\\". It's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want. I could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party... What's the purpose of this passage? A) To introduce Dr. Seuss's life. B) To analyze Dr. Seuss's books. C) To describe Dr. Seuss's writing style. D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. A:","completion":"The purpose of this passage is D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. The writer is not merely introducing Dr. Seuss's life or analyzing his books, though these elements are indeed present in the passage. Instead, these aspects of Dr. Seuss's life and work are used in service of acknowledging and honoring his achievements. The author is showing the enduring legacy of Dr. Seuss's work, not only as they influenced their own childhood but now as they bring joy and lessons to their own children. More than that, the writer is praising Dr. Seuss's unique writing style, one that flows \\"with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem.\\" The author also highlights the innovative topicality of Dr. Seuss's work, referencing \\"The Lorax\\" and the way it tackles environmental concerns before such topics were widely discussed, appreciating how Seuss was ahead of his time. This acknowledgment of Dr. Seuss's exquisite imagination, unique writing style, moral lessons in his stories, and his forward-thinking themes forms a celebration of his brilliant accomplishments in the field of children's literature. Lastly, the writer ends the passage on a note of festivity, stating it's a birthday and hence a reason to celebrate, thereby further emphasizing the celebratory tone of the passage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. Context: When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the king both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been chosen according to parliamentary support. At first, Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the runup to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff's defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country's defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech--which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative--Gustaf promised to strengthen the country's defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the king parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to \\"communicate freely with the Swedish people.\\" The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjold (father of Dag Hammarskjold) in its place. To date, it is the last time that a Swedish king directly intervened in the governing of the country. The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widen. However, Widen was unable to form a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff's successor as Liberal leader, Nils Eden. The Eden government promptly arrogated most of the king's political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918-1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers' advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that \\"the King alone shall govern the realm\\" remained unchanged, for all intents and purposes the ministers did the actual governing. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a de facto reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalized until 1974. Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmo with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V's objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany's side. Question: What did Gustaf say about the Germans?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Gustaf V did not directly say anything specific about the Germans in the information you provided.

[III] They have been cooped up all day while I work and want to enjoy the sun .. [IV] They do n't like being outdoors all the time and want to lay inside .. Answer the following question: Why do the cats want to go out to the sunny patio so badly ?","completion":"The cats want to go out to the sunny patio so badly for a variety of reasons, as indicated by the description provided. It appears that option [III] They have been cooped up all day while I work and want to enjoy the sun, is the most accurate explanation for their behavior. Here are some of the reasons why they might be eager to spend time outside on the patio: 1. Natural instinct: Cats, as descendants of wild felines, have an inherent desire to explore and roam in their natural environment. Outdoor access allows them to fulfill these natural needs and engage in various activities such as hunting, climbing, and territorial marking. 2. Sunshine and warmth: Cats are known for their love of warmth and sunlight. Their bodies are designed to absorb and retain heat from the sun, making sunbathing an enjoyable and cozy experience. The warmth of the patio's sun-soaked concrete is likely a pleasurable sensation to them. 3. Physical and mental stimulation: Being outdoors offers cats a wealth of visual, auditory, and olfactory stimulation. Engaging in activities such as stalking and chasing chipmunks or moths not only provides physical exercise but also helps keep their minds sharp and instincts honed. This mental and physical stimulation can contribute to their overall well-being and happiness. 4. Territory expansion: Cats are territorial creatures, and by exploring the outdoors, they can expand their territory, whether it's just around the patio or further out into the garden. This territorial claim helps them feel secure in their environment, and they may feel the urge to patrol or defend their domain. 5. Social interaction: Although cats are often considered solitary animals, they do engage in social interactions with other cats or animals when given the opportunity. By going outside, they can encounter other cats or wildlife to interact with, curiously observe, or even just play with. 6. Entertainment: The outdoors can be a never-ending source of entertainment for cats. From watching birds fly to stalking squirrels, the opportunities for excitement and play are limitless. This keeps them entertained and helps break up the monotony they might experience when confined indoors all day. In conclusion, the cats' desire to be outside on the sunny patio is a combination of natural instinct, love for warmth and sunshine, physical and mental stimulation, territorial behavior, social interaction, and entertainment. As a responsible cat owner, it's crucial to provide them with opportunities to experience these outdoor joys while ensuring their safety and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning three or four decades.

Articulate: This term is generally associated with clear and effective communication, especially in speech. It doesn't directly relate to hands or manual labor. 2. Soft: Individuals who do not engage in manual labor often have softer hands, as their skin is not calloused or roughened from manual work. This is a relevant descriptor. 3. Sign language: While this involves hand movements, it is unrelated to whether someone does manual labor or not. It's a method of communication and not an accurate description of the hands themselves. 4. Graceful: This term refers to movement that is elegant and pleasing to the eye. While it can be used to describe hand movements, it does not directly relate to manual labor. 5. Cup water: This is an action that can be performed by anyone, regardless of their occupation or experience in manual labor. It doesn't specifically describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"soft\\" because it directly relates to the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is android better than iOS in 2016? Does iOS really work better than Android? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"In 2016, both Android and iOS had their unique advantages and made significant progress, so comparing them requires looking at various aspects and use-cases. First, let's discuss the two statements in the questions to understand the context: 1. Is Android better than iOS in 2016? 2. Does iOS really work better than Android? These two questions are similar but not exactly the same. While the first question focuses on a direct comparison of Android and iOS in 2016, the second question implies that iOS is widely considered to work better than Android and asks about the validity of this belief. To make a comparison between the two, we can look at the following aspects: 1. Customization: One of the biggest strengths of Android in 2016 was its customization capabilities. Users could personalize their devices by adding widgets, changing app icons, and installing custom launchers. This freedom made Android more appealing to those who wanted a tailored user experience. On the other hand, iOS had limited customization options, keeping the interface more homogeneous. 2. App Quality: Generally, iOS had a reputation for delivering high-quality applications. Since it had fewer device models and strict guidelines, developers could optimize their apps for a specific resolution and hardware configurations, resulting in smoother performance. Android, being open source, had a wider range of devices with varying resolutions and hardware capabilities, making it a challenge for developers to ensure a consistent user experience. 3. Security: iOS is well-known for its strong security measures due to Apple's closed ecosystem and strict app review process. This made it less prone to malware and viruses, especially in comparison to Android. Android, with its open nature, was more likely to encounter security breaches. However, Google made significant efforts to improve the security of Android devices with features like Google Play Protect and Android Nougat's granular app permission controls. 4. Hardware & Price Range: In terms of hardware, Android devices offered a broader choice of manufacturers and price ranges, catering to different budgets. This flexibility allowed customers to choose a device that met their specific needs and preferences. In contrast, Apple's iOS devices were limited to iPhones, which were typically more expensive and had fewer hardware options. 5. Software Updates: Apple prided itself on providing timely software updates to iOS devices, including those that were relatively old. This was a significant advantage over Android, where the number of devices and manufacturers often led to delayed updates or older devices being left with outdated software. 6. Ecosystem Integration: Apple's ecosystem of devices, like Macs, iPads, and Apple Watches, all worked seamlessly with iPhones, making them more appealing to users who were looking to have a unified experience. In comparison, Android was not as closely integrated with other devices, although there were exceptions with certain manufacturers. In conclusion, deciding whether Android or iOS was better in 2016 depends on an individual's preferences and needs. Android offered greater customization and a wider choice of devices at different price points, while iOS was known for its higher quality apps, increased security, prompt software updates, and ecosystem integration. The two questions provided are inquiring about similar information, but the second question seeks to examine if iOS genuinely had a performance advantage over Android."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... David Meyer probably believes that A. Multitasking is hard B. not enough information C.

I'm in school and due to financial reasons I'll be moving back in with my parents. My sister is also there and she has an 11 month old. I've been talking with my mom for the last month about how to make this work and we've 90% settled out the details. My sister called me today and I've just found out that she has an entire different view on it. She has ground rules because of the baby, but I completely disagree with many of them which I'll talk about below. Some of them, I get and am supportive of. &amp;#x200B; This is what she's proposing: &amp;#x200B; -&gt; My medicine in a lock box in my room -&gt; I must keep my room baby friendly (no choking hazards, etc) -&gt; My cat needs to be locked in the basement at all times -&gt; I have to keep my dishes in my room or in one single area (food allergies) -&gt; I have a list of her pet peeves that I can't do (No left overs in the fridge, etc) -&gt; I can't bring most of my furniture, only the small things bc there is 'no space' &amp;#x200B; Now, from this it's implied that her and baby will have free reign of my room. I want to keep my cat in my bedroom at first until it becomes accustomed to the people/house and then most likely let it stay in the basement with me when I'm down there because it's a much larger space. I 100% understand that she's not comfortable with a cat near her child, so I get not letting it roam the house, but why can't it be in my bedroom? I mentioned putting a lock on my door to keep baby out and safe but she said that baby's always find a way into rooms and that my cat will be let out. I asked why people will be entering my room, and she said that she wants somewhere she can go to be alone when I'm not there. She's upset because she shares a room with the baby and doesn't have her own space. I told her that despite that I still need and want my own space. She also said that she wants help with the baby and implied that I would be able to help watch him anytime she wanted some freedom. IMO, this isn't ok. I'm fine with babysitting and helping out but I have my own life and can't be watching a baby whenever she wants a break. I also told her that I'll be bring my furniture will put the 2-3 non bedroom things in the basement. She said that there's no room and that I should throw it out. I'll be moving out in a year or so and can't afford to re-buy my furniture. AITA for demanding that my sister and her baby stay out of my room when I'm not there? For deciding to put a lock on the door so that no one can go in there when I'm not home? For not wanting to be her free personal baby sitter?

Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail.

While being filmed, the girl smiles.Shuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a \\"briefing room\\" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains. Students resistant to their rules or entering one of the randomly placed \\"death zones\\" for each day are to be killed by the collar's detonation. One of the 42 students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, interferes with the video by whispering to her friends; Kitano kills her on the spot with a thrown knife. While a shocked class is subdued by soldiers, Kuninobu openly confronts the viciousness of Kitano and the teacher slashes him with a knife (in the back of leg - the same area Kuninobu attacked Kitano two years earlier) before detonating his collar while Shuya, his best friend, watches in horror.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates The answer is:","completion":"The final step of this process is \\"the moisture evaporates.\\" This is the culmination of the body's efforts to regulate and cool down its temperature. Let's break down the steps and justify each one: 1. Body temperature rises: This is the initial condition. An increase in body temperature can be caused by various factors such as physical activity, hot weather, or fever. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate: When the body detects an increased temperature, the hypothalamus (a part of the brain) sends a signal to the blood vessels to dilate (widen) and increase blood flow to the skin's surface. This step helps in dissipating heat through the increased surface area of blood vessels and loss of heat through radiation. 3. The sweat glands become active: In response to the increased temperature, the sweat glands become active and start producing sweat. Sweat glands are located all over the body and are responsible for regulating body temperature by producing sweat. 4. Moisture is released from the pores: Once the sweat glands become active, they produce sweat (composed mainly of water, salt, and some minerals), which is then released onto the skin's surface through the pores. This step aids in cooling the body down as the moisture on the skin absorbs the heat from the body. 5. The moisture evaporates: This is the final step of the process. The moisture present on the skin evaporates, taking away the heat absorbed from the body with it. This evaporation of sweat is an endothermic process, meaning it requires heat, and thus, as heat is utilized for the evaporation, it helps to cool the body down."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask for private Snaps. Move the conversation off Snapchat. Article:","completion":"Title: Enhancing Your Snapchat Experience: Responding to Snaps, Requesting Private Snaps, and Moving Conversations Off-platform Introduction Snapchat is an immensely popular social media platform known for its ephemeral and interactive nature. Users can easily share moments of their lives with friends, engage with creative content, and explore new avenues of communication. However, it can sometimes become challenging to fully engage with people you've connected with on the platform. In this article, we will discuss three techniques to enhance your Snapchat experience: responding to snaps, asking for private snaps, and moving the conversation off Snapchat. 1. Responding to Snaps Receiving snaps from your friends and acquaintances is a fundamental part of the Snapchat experience. Responding to their snaps is crucial in various ways: A. Strengthening Connections: By actively engaging with others' content, you show them that you're invested in their experiences and interested in what they have to share. This helps in fostering closeness and maintaining a strong bond with your Snapchat contacts. B. Encouraging Reciprocity: Responding to snaps demonstrates your enthusiasm for the platform, which may encourage others to share more snaps with you. People are more likely to share content with those who are responsive and engaging. C. Enhancing Visibility: Responding to snaps can keep you on top of your friends' minds, as your conversation threads remain active. This can help you gain more visibility among your contacts and increase your chances of receiving future snaps from them. 2. Asking for Private Snaps While Snapchat is primarily designed for sharing content with multiple people simultaneously, it also enables users to send private snaps directly to specific individuals. By asking for private snaps, you can strengthen your connections and create a more personalized experience. A. Building Trust: Requesting private snaps can signify trust, as you are allowing the sender to share something exclusively with you. This can help deepen connections and make your relationship feel more genuine. B. Personalized Content: Private snaps are more likely to be tailored to your interests and preferences since they are intended for specific recipients. This can result in a more enjoyable and engaging experience. 3. Moving the Conversation Off Snapchat Once a connection has been established, it can be beneficial to move the conversation beyond Snapchat and onto other platforms. A. Extended Conversations: Snapchat's temporary nature can sometimes make it difficult to have in-depth conversations. By transitioning your communication to a different platform, you can engage in more meaningful discussions that are not restricted by time or format limitations. B. Strengthening Connections: Moving the conversation to another platform indicates that your relationship has progressed beyond casual interactions on Snapchat. This could lead to more profound connections and potentially deeper friendships. C. Diversifying Communication Channels: Engaging contacts on multiple platforms provides more opportunities to connect, and opens up different ways in which you can interact. Expanding your communication channels can help enrich your experience and strengthen relationships with your contacts. Conclusion Snapchat is a fun and exciting platform that allows users to share snippets of their life with friends and followers. By actively responding to snaps, requesting private snaps, and moving conversations off Snapchat, you can elevate your social media experience and create more meaningful connections with your contacts. Remember that the key to maintaining strong relationships is to be responsive, attentive, and open to new ways of communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia reminds \\"Fester\\" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement. Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday and Pugsley, whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. The Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends to celebrate Fester's return, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault. Wednesday overhears Abigail and Gordon discussing their scheme, and escapes them by hiding in the family cemetery. Tully learns that Fester, as the eldest brother, is the executor of the Addams estate and therefore technically owns the entire...

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death. Griffin was killed because he came close to discovering the murderer's identity, and Jennifer is soon targeted after figuring this out as well. Captured by Owen, Jennifer escapes her death by...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:Twelve-year-old twin sisters Fitriani Sabatini and Fitriana Sabrina are among the top ranked players in their age group when they appear in tournaments such as the New Armada event in Central Java. The pair - affectionately known as Ani and Ana by their mother - have been taught at home for a year so they can concentrate on their tennis. \\"It was difficult to get the permission to skip classes to go to tournaments,\\" says their mother Yetti \\"Nur\\" Mastuti. \\"Their teachers were not very understanding.\\" Nur, and the youngsters' tennis coach father Nursalim sold the family home in Jakarta - and now live in rented accommodation - in order to pay tennis travel costs for the young pair. At least once a month they compete in tournaments, some of them away from their home city. The youngsters hope to emulate the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, who each went on to become the world's number one player. When I ask who would achieve this feat first, Ani, the older of the two. quips with a big smile, \\"The big sister first, of course.\\" But it is a dream that is increasingly hard to achieve for Indonesian players. Indonesia's economic growth is visible in the sprawling new apartments that dot the Jakarta skyline, and the modern buildings come with sporting facilities not previously available to many Indonesians. Tennis courts are a common feature. But the sport is not necessarily more popular today than a few years ago, when Indonesian tennis was a force to be reckoned with, at least regionally. Yayuk Basuki was Indonesia's biggest tennis star, winning four Asian Games gold medals in the 1980s and 1990s. She also reached the quarter finals of Wimbledon in 1997, the furthest any Indonesian has ever gone at a Grand Slam event. Later that year she also become the highest-ever WTF ranked tennis player from Indonesia, reaching number 19. Today she runs the Yayuk Basuki Tennis Academy, teaching more than 150 under-18-year-olds the fundamentals of the game. She claims her school charges less than others in Jakarta, because she wants to give everyone a chance to play. Yayuk's school has trouble finding affordable facilities to use. There are no free public tennis courts in Indonesia. Even government facilities charge fees, and Yayuk says the fees go up every year. \\"We're not asking for free facilities,\\" Yayuk said. \\"But if I can subsidise kids who are not wealthy enough to pay, why can't the government also subsidise if they have good facilities?\\" The situation means tennis remains known as a sport for the wealthy in the country. Most children who pick up tennis at a young age come from the upper middle class, who have access to a court at home, or whose family can afford to put them in a club. However, the trouble for Indonesia is that the majority of the privileged children are not interested in pursuing tennis in the way that twins Ana and Ani are. Their drive saw the twins win the doubles at the the New Armada tournament, and in the singles Ani was the losing finalist, and Ana reached the semis. Private tennis instructor Alex Santoso sees a lot of potential in some of his students. But he says those from richer families do not want to become professionals, as there is no guarantee they can \\"make a lot of money\\" by becoming a top-ranked male ATP or female WTA player. And he claims that with the current competition and development programmes in Indonesia \\"it's impossible to get there\\". The Indonesian Tennis Association, known as Pelti, is the governing body of tennis in the country. Many Indonesians who are involved in tennis criticise Pelti for neglecting the development of young players, which has led to the talent drain in the last few years. Its chairman Maman Wirjawan admits that there is a lot of work to be done, but refuses to take the blame. \\"It's not only the government's job. The government has many problems as well. So we have to support the government. We have to help find ways to build sport in this country,\\" he says. Since taking on the leadership of Pelti in 2012 he says he has been working on a sustainable programme to develop young talent. \\"We start from junior [level] - we are now planning to have tournaments in many cities, especially big cities, [in] 10 to 15 cities throughout the nation,\\" he explains. \\"We will hold it on a monthly basis for the next five years.\\" Wirjawan's programme can only succeed with corporate sponsorship. But he is a brother of Indonesia's Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan, and has extensive experience in port and oil and gas businesses. Many hope that his wide network can help secure the support tennis needs. That will give much comfort to potential talents like twins Ani and Ana who will be able to play more matches in their home town and improve their skills. But unless and until that happens, the sacrifices made by the twins and their family may be high-risk, and the outlook for Indonesian tennis remains bleak.

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid.

Well, that's what happened in a big movie called Captain America: Civil War. It's like a huge play fight between all your favorite Marvel superheroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and even Spider-Man! So, imagine if your toys were on an adventure and accidentally broke a few other toys? Would they need someone to watch them? That's the problem in the movie. After a mission goes wrong, it's asked if superheroes should have someone looking over their actions, like a grown-up watches you. Some superheroes think it's a good idea, and some don't - thus the play fight begins. People who watch a lot of movies (they're called critics) and regular folks who like to watch movies (audiences) thought this movie was really good. Joe from the Wall Street Journal says it's like a big, fun party with your favorite comic book characters. There's lots of action (think about when your toys do daring stunts and cool moves) mixed with comedy (which means lots of laughing). Plus, everything that happens in the story makes sense, which doesn't always happen in superhero movies. And hey, Spider-Man shows up too, which many think is very cool! And guess what? They say that if how Spider-Man is in this movie is a sign of what's to come, superhero movies are going to get even better! Brian from CNN thinks this movie feels like another Avengers film, like the ones you've seen before, but even better! It has lots of superheroes, more than usual, but it still stays interesting and fun. The ending, according to him, could have been better, but it's not too bad. Jamelle from Slate says the movie is not too serious, it's not dark, rather it's colorful and fun like when you let your imagination run wild during playtime. The best part? It has a really cool superhero fight, like the ones you set up with your toys, only bigger and better! All in all, according to most people, Captain America: Civil War is a great movie. It's smart, quick, and fun. And most importantly, it's jam-packed with action, just like the adventures your toys go on! So, imagine, kiddo, if your toys got their own big movie - that's exactly how cool and fun this film is!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The United Global Space Force prepares the first launch for the colonization of a distant planet much like our own. Meanwhile, a terrorist group called the Global Sedition wants to interrupt the colonization to be able to take over the same planet themselves.

The project is accelerated after Sedition terrorists attack Earth's hypergate, but are stopped by fighter pilots, one of whom is Major Don West. When the pilot for the Jupiter Mission is murdered, West is assigned as his replacement. Dr. Zachary Smith, a spy employed by the Sedition, reprograms the mission's robot to destroy the ship. He is betrayed, though, by his employers and left as an unwilling stowaway when the Jupiter II blasts off. A few hours after launch, the robot activates and starts destroying vital ship and navigation controls. The Robinsons, awakened from their cryosleep by Dr. Smith, stop the robot, but not before it causes the ship to become trapped in the gravitational pull of the Sun.

A sperm and egg meet inside a woman's fallopian tube: Age might affect the quality of a woman's eggs, but this step in the process does not directly involve the uterus. 2. The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus: Again, age might affect the quality of the egg, but the uterus is not involved in this step. 3. The zygote implants in the uterus: Age could affect the uterus's ability to support implantation, possibly due to a thinner uterine lining or a decrease in blood supply to the uterus. This might result in lower chances of a successful pregnancy. 4. The zygote becomes an embryo, the embryo becomes a fetus, and the fetus grows for approximately 9 months: Age could increase the risk of pregnancy complications, including those related to the uterus, which might result in a higher likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature birth. 5. The woman gives birth to a baby: An older uterus might have decreased strength and elasticity, potentially affecting the ease and safety of delivery (i.e., increased risk of complications). Given this analysis, an older and potentially less healthy uterus could lead to a higher likelihood of unsuccessful implantation, pregnancy complications, or delivery issues, all of which could contribute to a woman having fewer babies.

I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake. However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger. We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was. It must have been over 45 minutes though, and the manager came out to apologize and reassure us that the burgers were coming right away.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the alias of the person who gives a bottle of wine to Rudolf as a gift? ? Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll decides to pass the time by attending the coronation of his distant relation, King Rudolf V of Ruritania (also played by Stone) . He encounters an acquaintance on the train there, Antoinette de Mauban, the mistress of the king's treacherous brother, Grand Duke 'Black' Michael. The day before the coronation, Rassendyll is seen by Colonel Sapt and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim. Astounded by the uncanny resemblance between Rassendyll and their liege, they take him to meet Rudolf at a hunting lodge. The king is delighted with his double and invites him to dinner. During the meal, a servant brings in a fine bottle of wine, a present from Michael delivered by his henchman, Rupert of Hentzau. After Rudolf tastes it, he finds it so irresistible that he drinks the entire bottle by himself. The next morning, Sapt is unable to rouse him; the wine was drugged. Sapt is afraid that if the coronation is postponed, Michael will seize the throne. The country is dangerously divided between the supporters of Rudolf and of Michael. The colonel declares that it is Fate that brought Rassendyll to Ruritania; he can take Rudolf's place with no one the wiser. The Englishman is less certain, but he tosses a coin, which lands in Rudolf's favor, and Rassendyll goes through with the ceremony. Afterwards, he is driven to the palace in the company of the universally adored Princess Flavia. Later, when Rassendyll returns to the lodge to switch places with the king once more, he and Sapt find only the corpse of Josef, the servant left to guard the king. Rassendyll is forced to continue the masquerade.","completion":"In the given article, the alias of the person who gives a bottle of wine to Rudolf as a gift is Rupert of Hentzau. He is described as the henchman of Michael, the king's treacherous brother. The wine was drugged, which subsequently caused King Rudolf V to pass out and led to the events that followed, including Rassendyll stepping in to take the king's place at the coronation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Men are in a line in a bycicle in a competition. men","completion":"In a bicycle competition, men are lined up and ready to race. What most naturally follows is the series of events and processes that take place during a typical bicycle race competition. Let's break it down into various stages and aspects of the race: 1. Pre-race preparations: Prior to the start of the competition, participants would have completed their registration process and collected their race numbers. They will have also checked their bikes to ensure that they are in good working order and complied with any equipment regulations. The race organizers would have set up the race course, including markings and safety measures, such as placing barriers, marshals, and first aid stations along the route. 2. Strategies and planning: Riders and their teams would have developed race strategies tailored to the specific conditions of the competition, such as the route, weather, terrain, and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Some riders may aim to go for an early breakaway, while others may want to ride in the peloton (main group) and conserve energy for a sprint finish. 3. The starting line: Riders would have warmed up and assembled at the starting line, prepared to begin the race. The race official would make any last-minute announcements, and the countdown to the start will commence. Once the starting gun or whistle is sounded, the race begins. 4. The race: Throughout the race, individual riders and teams will contend for positions and may attempt to break away from the main group to gain an advantage. Each rider's performance during the race will be determined by their tactical decision-making, physical fitness, ability to handle their bicycle in various terrain types, and their ability to navigate the race course efficiently. 5. Aid stations and support vehicles: Along the race route, riders may need to stop at aid stations or receive support from team vehicles if they require mechanical assistance, water, or nourishment. Race marshals and officials may provide assistance and enforce race rules along the route as well. 6. Finish line: As racers approach the finish line, some might sprint to try to get ahead of their competitors, while others may be simply focused on completing the race. The winner of the race will be the first one to cross the finish line, and the subsequent racers will have their position in the competition determined based on the order of their arrival. 7. Results and celebrations: After the race, the official results will be calculated, including the winners for any race categories, such as age groups or gender-based classifications. The awarding ceremonies will follow, where winners and those who placed on the podium receive their medals or trophies. Post-race celebrations and festivities are common, allowing racers and supporters an opportunity to socialize, discuss race strategies and experiences, share achievements, and enjoy food and refreshments. Overall, what most naturally follows the men's bicycle race competition are the exciting and challenging events taking place during the race, as well as the post-race gatherings and celebrations. Races bring together individuals and communities, showcasing the spirit of sportsmanship, camaraderie, and passion for cycling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Besides happiness, what contradictory meaning does China ascribe to green?","completion":"In Chinese culture, green is primarily seen as a symbol of fertility and happiness. However, it may also have a contradictory meaning associated with infidelity. This negative connotation may not be as prevalent or widely recognized as the positive associations of fertility and happiness, but it is present in some aspects of Chinese culture, particularly in literature and idioms. For example, a well-known Chinese expression, \\"wearing a green hat\\" (戴绿帽子 or dài lǜ màozi), symbolizes a man whose wife or partner is unfaithful. The origin of this phrase can be traced back to the Yuan dynasty, when the families of prostitutes were required to wear green clothing and accessories. Another example is the classic Chinese novel \\"Dream of the Red Chamber,\\" where one of the main characters, Jia Baoyu, describes the jealousy caused by suspicion of infidelity as \\"green plums simmering in a golden pot\\" (金炉绿梅 or jīnlú lǜméi).

Please answer a question about the following article about Nintendo Entertainment System: The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". What was the lockout chip number for UK, Italy, and Australia?","completion":"The lockout chip number for the UK, Italy, and Australia was 3197.

They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. and the situation: Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41. Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in. When Adam and him play games together Chris also seems to lose more often now even though historically he has always been better. Answer the following question: Which brother is likely experiencing a decline in strength, Adam or Chris? The answer is:","completion":"Chris is likely experiencing a decline in strength. Step 1: Identify the ages of Adam and Chris - Adam is 27, and Chris is 41.

Adam is still in his late 20s, not yet in middle adulthood, while Chris is in his early 40s, fitting within the middle adulthood stage. Step 3: Analyze the physical signs and declining abilities mentioned in the background - It's stated that in middle adulthood, people start showing physical signs of aging (such as gray hair) and their strength, reaction time, and vision may begin to decline. Step 4: Compare this information to the situation - Chris is showing signs of aging (gray hair) and experiencing a decline in his performance at games, which could indicate a decline in strength, reaction time, and/or other age-related factors.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It is not enough to describe some objects by their location. We may also need to know its direction. For example, a wind blows a storm over your school. Where is that storm coming from? Where is it going? How can we describe a direction? The most common way is by using a compass. A compass is a device with a floating needle (Figure 2.1). The needle is a small magnet. The needle aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle always points to magnetic north. If you have a compass and you find north. You can then know any other direction. See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose. The Earth has two poles. It has a magnetic north pole. It also has a geographic north pole. These two poles are close to each other but not the exact same place. Do you have any questions?","completion":"A compass is an essential tool for finding direction, as it allows us to orient ourselves based on the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle, which acts like a small magnet, aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing to the magnetic north. By finding the north, you can then determine other directions such as east, south, and west using the compass rose. The Earth has two poles: the magnetic north pole and the geographic north pole. Although they are close to each other, they are not in the exact same location. The magnetic north pole is the point on the Earth where the planet's magnetic field points directly downwards, while the geographic north pole is the northernmost point of the Earth's axis of rotation. To describe direction, we can use the cardinal points on a compass rose: north, south, east, and west. We can further refine these directions by using intermediate cardinal points (or ordinal directions), which are the points between the cardinal points. These ordinal directions are northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. Additionally, we can describe a direction in terms of its angle, known as its bearing or azimuth, relative to true north or magnetic north. For instance, in the example of a storm approaching a school, we can use a compass to identify the direction from which it is coming and where it is headed. By observing the compass rose, we can deduce if the storm is moving from the north, east, west, or south or any of the intermediate directions. This information can help us make decisions about our actions to stay safe and plan accordingly. In conclusion, a compass is a valuable instrument in determining direction, using the Earth's magnetic field as a reference. By understanding the compass rose and cardinal points, we can describe direction accurately and make informed decisions based on the location and movement of objects, like the storm in the given example."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the question to: \\"Qualified medical and family reasons include: personal or family illness, family military leave, pregnancy , adoption , or the foster care placement of a child.\\"? The topic is Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. A:","completion":"The question related to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 that pertains to the statement \\"Qualified medical and family reasons include: personal or family illness, family military leave, pregnancy, adoption, or the foster care placement of a child\\" could be: What are the qualified medical and family reasons for which an employee can take leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993? The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a United States labor law that entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. The goal of this act is to help employees balance their work life and family commitments, ensuring they don't suffer adverse consequences in their employment for taking time off due to qualified reasons. Under the FMLA, eligible employees can take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following reasons: 1. Personal illness: If the employee has a serious health condition that requires time off from work for receiving medical care, treatment or recovery, they may take FMLA leave. 2. Family illness: If an employee's immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) has a serious health condition that requires the employee's care and support, FMLA leave can be used to provide such care. 3. Family military leave: FMLA leave can be used when an employee's spouse, child, or parent is on active duty (or being called to active duty) in the Armed Forces, which necessitates the employee's time off to manage family affairs and related exigencies. 4. Pregnancy: Employees can use FMLA leave for prenatal care, incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum recovery. 5. Adoption: If an employee is adopting a child or initiating the process of adoption, they may take FMLA leave to attend appointments, complete legal requirements, and bond with the newly adopted child. 6. Foster care placement: FMLA leave is also available for employees who are undergoing the process of placing a child in their care as foster parents. This could include attending appointments, legal proceedings, and the initial bonding period. In summary, the FMLA was enacted to protect employees' rights to take time off for specific medical and family reasons without jeopardizing their job security. By understanding the various qualified reasons for which FMLA leave can be taken, employees and employers can work together to support a healthy balance between work and personal life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone has a different approach, and factors like space, climate, and your own aesthetic determine what type of garden will work for you.","completion":"In order to grow a garden, it is essential to go through a series of steps that will ensure the success and beauty of your green space. Here is a comprehensive guide on how to grow and maintain a garden that suits your preferences and conditions. 1. Assess your space and location: Determine the size of the garden area and its location in your property. Consider the amount of sunlight and shade it receives, as some plants require more sunlight than others. Also, think about the availability of water sources and the overall soil quality. 2. Research your plant choices: Identify the types of plants you would like to grow in your garden. Consider factors such as the plant's hardiness to the area, their ability to thrive in your soil type, and availability of sun and shade in your garden. 3. Design your garden layout: Plan the layout of your garden by accounting for the size and growth patterns of your chosen plants. Some plants may require more space or specific planting arrangements to thrive. It is also essential to consider how the colors, textures, and sizes of various plants will create a visually pleasing and cohesive design. 4. Prepare the soil: Test your soil to determine its pH level, nutrient content, and overall quality. Amend your soil based on the specific needs of your chosen plants, which may include adding organic matter, nutrients, or altering the pH level to create the optimal growing environment. 5. Purchase your plants and materials: Obtain seeds, plants, and gardening supplies, such as tools, fertilizers, and mulches. Buy quality plants and seeds from reputable sources to ensure they are healthy and free of pests and diseases. Choose the right gardening tools and equipment to make your work more comfortable and efficient. 6. Plant your garden: Start by clearing the chosen area of weeds, rocks, and debris. Prepare individual planting beds for each plant type according to their specific requirements. Install support structures for climbing or large plants, if needed. Follow the recommended planting guidelines for each plant, including appropriate spacing, depth, and timing. 7. Water your garden regularly: Provide your plants with the right amount of water. Keep in mind that different plants have specific watering needs depending on their root system and natural environment. Water your garden in the early morning or late evening to minimize water loss through evaporation. 8. Mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds: Apply a layer of organic mulch, such as straw, wood chips, or shredded leaves, around your plants. This will help conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature. 9. Monitor for pests and diseases: Inspect your garden regularly for signs of pests and diseases that may harm your plants. Use organic or chemical treatments as needed, but always try the least toxic method first. Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs or lacewings, to help control pests naturally. 10. Fertilize your plants: Apply organic or synthetic fertilizers to encourage healthy plant growth and increase yield. Use a balanced fertilizer to promote all-around plant development or specific formulations to target different nutritional needs. 11. Prune and maintain: Regularly prune your plants to promote healthy growth, shape, and appearance. Remove dead, diseased, or crowded branches, and cut back overgrown plants to encourage new growth. 12. Harvest and enjoy: Collect the fruits of your labor when your plants reach maturity. Harvest your fruits, vegetables, or herbs at their peak freshness and flavor. By following these steps, you can create a beautiful and bountiful garden that serves as an expression of your personal tastes and passions. Gardening is a rewarding and therapeutic activity that can bring joy and fulfillment to your life. So, go ahead and start planning that perfect garden today!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bobby couldn't get the new car he bought into the garage because the pick from the following. - car was to big. - garage was to big.","completion":"Bobby couldn't get the new car he bought into the garage because the car was too big. It was an exciting day for Bobby as he had just purchased his dream car, a stunning and powerful sports utility vehicle (SUV). He had always admired the elegant design, luxury features, and impressive performance of such vehicles and, after years of saving money and doing extensive research, he had finally managed to buy one. As he pulled into the driveway of his suburban home with a grand smile on his face, he was eager to park his brand-new SUV in the garage and begin exploring all the car's advanced features. However, as he approached the garage and attempted to park the vehicle inside, he quickly realized that the car was simply too large to fit through the garage doorway. He tried several angles, but it soon became apparent that there was just no way the car could squeeze into the garage. Bobby felt disheartened by this realization. He had never foreseen this issue when he had eagerly signed the papers and taken the keys from the dealership. In the midst of his excitement, he had overlooked the dimensions of his new SUV and never considered whether it would fit into his current garage. Determined to find a solution, Bobby decided to take a few measurements, comparing the size of his car with the garage. He discovered that the height and width of the SUV exceeded the dimensions of the garage door by several inches, rendering it impossible to get the car inside. Further inspection of the garage revealed that even if he could somehow get the car through the doorway, the garage's interior was just not spacious enough to accommodate the length of the SUV. This problem needed to be resolved urgently, as leaving his new car outside was not a viable long-term option. Bobby began exploring different solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each. The first idea was to modify the existing garage by enlarging the entrance and creating more interior space. This, however, would prove to be a complicated and expensive process involving extensive renovations and potential permit requirements. The next option Bobby considered was to purchase a larger, portable garage. This seemed more feasible, but would still result in additional costs. He also gave some thought to selling his new SUV and opting for a smaller, more garage-friendly vehicle. However, this alternative was quickly dismissed, as Bobby was not willing to part with the car he had worked so hard to acquire. After much thought, Bobby settled on building a new, larger garage that would comfortably house his new car. He contacted a contractor, who presented him with several design options, allowing him to choose the most efficient and aesthetically pleasing layout. Construction began in the following weeks, and Bobby felt a renewed sense of excitement as he watched the new garage take shape. He recognized that this setback had been a learning experience, reminding him of the importance of thorough planning and thinking ahead. Once the new garage was completed, Bobby was finally able to park his beloved SUV safely inside. He was relieved and satisfied, knowing that his car was now snugly tucked away from potential harm and the elements. The garage issue had been a significant bump in the road, but Bobby was proud of his ability to adapt and find a fitting solution. With his mind now at ease, Bobby was ready to fully enjoy his new SUV and embark on countless road trips and adventures with his luxurious, spacious companion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"I shall go downtown.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"Yes, a linguist would generally rate the sentence \\"I shall go downtown.\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This sentence demonstrates multiple aspects of sentence structure and linguistic acceptability that make it appropriate for usage according to standard English grammar rules. 1. Subject-Verb Agreement: The sentence displays proper subject-verb agreement with the singular subject, \\"I,\\" being paired with the singular form of the verb, \\"shall go.\\" 2. Verb Tense: The verb tense of \\"shall go\\" implies that the speaker intends to take the action in the future, which is a crucial component of any language system's capacity to express temporal distinctions. Within English grammar, the use of \\"shall\\" with the first person pronoun is an older, more formal way to indicate future intention than the more modern and common usage of \\"will.\\" 3. Verb Modality: The word \\"shall\\" is a modal verb, which adds the nuance of necessity or obligation to the base verb, \\"go.\\" This introduces an additional layer of meaning to the sentence, lending a sense of certainty or commitment to the intended action of going downtown. 4. Proper Noun: \\"Downtown\\" is a proper noun typically referring to the central or commercial area of a city or town. It provides necessary geographical information and is a common and acceptable term in English. 5. Semantic Completeness: The sentence \\"I shall go downtown.\\" is semantically complete, as it contains a subject (I), an action (shall go), and a destination (downtown). Consequently, the sentence conveys a complete idea that can be understood by a native English speaker without needing further clarification. 6. Syntactic Structure: The sentence follows a standard English SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) syntactic structure. \\"I\\" is the subject, \\"shall go\\" is the verb phrase, and \\"downtown\\" functions as the object which receives the action. Taking these points into consideration, a linguist would classify the sentence \\"I shall go downtown\\" as linguistically acceptable and grammatically correct within the context of Standard English. However, it is important to note that language is always evolving, and different linguistic communities may exhibit variations in usage or priorities. Additionally, variations in formality and registers may impact the social acceptability of certain phrasings, but overall, this sentence does adhere to the established rules and principles that guide the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: [A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no;","completion":"[B]. It is not possible to tell. Determining whether \\"The play was very well acted\\" based solely on the presence of an unlikely cast and mixed reviews is not sufficient for making a definitive conclusion. To draw a conclusion about the quality of the acting in the four-hour Hamlet production, numerous factors should be taken into consideration. 1. Cast Performance: The performance of the main actors, including Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, and Charlton Heston, needs to be critically evaluated. While it may be surprising that these actors were chosen for their roles in Hamlet, it is important to examine their portrayals of the individual characters to gauge the effectiveness of the casting decision. 2. Ensemble Performance: Alongside the main actors, the performances of the supporting cast members can also contribute significantly to the overall quality of the acting. Observing the chemistry between actors, the ability to portray emotions effectively, and the capacity to immerse themselves in the world of the play can give a better idea of whether the play was well acted as a whole. 3. Direction: The choices made by the director in terms of staging, pacing, and overall interpretation of the play can strongly influence the quality of the acting. If the director was able to guide the actors in delivering compelling, believable performances, it may lead to a well-acted play. 4. Review Content: When examining reviews of the play, it is important to consider specific comments about the acting abilities of the cast members. If the majority of reviews highlight exceptional acting skills from the actors, it could be inferred that the play was well acted. However, if reviews express concerns about the casting choices or lackluster performances, it might indicate that the acting was not up to par. 5. Audience Reception: The opinions of audience members who watched the production can be quite valuable in determining the quality of the acting. Crowd reactions and engagement during the performance, as well as post-show discussions, can give insight into the effectiveness of the acting in engaging and immersing the audience into the world of the play. Considering these factors, it is crucial to delve deeper into the aspects mentioned above to draw any conclusion about the quality of the acting in the four-hour Hamlet production. Merely relying on the unlikely cast and mixed reviews is not enough to make a definitive statement about whether the play was well acted or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

This article: Leonard Harrison State Park is a 585-acre (237 ha) Pennsylvania state park in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is on the east rim of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, which is 800 feet (240 m) deep and nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 m) across here. It also serves as headquarters for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, its sister park on the west rim of the gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge, and offers hiking, fishing and hunting, whitewater boating, and camping. The park is in Shippen and Delmar Townships, 10 miles (16 km) west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660. Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek. The path was later used by lumbermen, and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988. Since 1996, the 63.4-mile (102.0 km) Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the park. The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area, while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River. The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which have been reintroduced to the area. Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is now covered by second growth forest, thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park is named for Leonard Harrison, a Wellsboro lumberman who cut the timber there, then established the park, which he donated to the state in 1922.

Plot title: Halloween II Movie plot: After being attacked by Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), who vanished after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony on October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that same night while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues to search for Michael. Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister. Now knowing Laurie is in danger and that he must get to her before Michael does, Loomis shoots at the window, demanding the Marshal quickly bring him to the hospital where she is.

Finnish: Koulutukseen liittyen tähän asti on saattanut kohdistua vähäisempi painoarvo. Kuitenkin ymmärrämme, että kyseisen asiayhteyden tai aiheen merkitys voi kasvaa tulevaisuudessa. Koulutuksen alalla on jatkuvasti kehittyviä toimintatapoja, lähestymistapoja ja teorioita, mikä tarkoittaa, että aiemmin vähemmän huomioon otettuja tekijöitä voidaan tutkia ja arvostaa enemmän tulevaisuudessa. Nykyisessä globaalissa yhteiskunnassa koulutus on entistä tärkeämpää, sillä se antaa ihmisille tietoja, taitoja ja kompetensseja, jotka ovat välttämättömiä heidän menestykselleen ja hyvinvoinnilleen. Tämän vuoksi koulutukseen liittyviin aiheisiin ja niiden merkitykseen tulisi suhtautua vakavasti sekä pyrkiä edistämään niiden tunnustamista ja arvostusta. Yksi esimerkki sellaisesta alasta, joka on saanut vasta viime aikoina enemmän huomiota, on elinikäinen oppiminen. Se tarkoittaa sitä, että yksilöiden on jatkuvasti päivitettävä tietojaan ja taitojaan vastaamaan nykyisiä ja tulevia työmarkkinoita. Tällainen koulutusmalli auttaa varmistamaan, että ihmiset ovat joustavia, mukautuvat ja kykenevät kohtaamaan uusia haasteita sekä taloudellisella että henkilökohtaisella tasolla. Toinen esimerkki on kestävä kehitys ja sen integroiminen koulutukseen. Yhä useammat koulutusjärjestelmät maailmanlaajuisesti tunnistavat tarpeen opettaa oppilaille kestävän kehityksen periaatteita ja käytäntöjä, joihin kuuluu esimerkiksi ympäristönsuojelu, sosiaalinen oikeudenmukaisuus ja taloudellinen vakaus. Tämä auttaa valmistamaan nuoria sukupolvia kohtaamaan maailmanlaajuisia haasteita ja rakentamaan kestävämpiä ja vastuullisempia yhteiskuntia. Nämä kaksi esimerkkiä osoittavat, että koulutukseen liittyviä aiheita, joihin on aiemmin kiinnitetty vähemmän huomiota, voidaan nyt tunnustaa ja arvostaa enemmän. Samalla ne korostavat koulutuksen merkitystä yksilöiden ja yhteiskuntien hyvinvoinnin kannalta. Jos haluamme rakentaa parempia tulevaisuudennäkymiä koko maailmalle, meidän on jatkuvasti varmistettava, että koulutusjärjestelmät ja -käytännöt ovat ajan tasalla ja ottavat huomioon eri alat ja niiden tarpeet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: + Yes + No Q: If I tell you that Keystone species are a source of food for many fish species, and ask you the question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\", is the correct answer \\"layers of fat\\"? A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"layers of fat.\\" The question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" can be answered by referring to the concept of Keystone species. Keystone species are crucial organisms within an ecosystem that disproportionately contribute to the balance and stability of the entire system. These species typically play a critical role in maintaining essential interactions, such as predation and resource distribution among other organisms. The removal or loss of a keystone species can lead to significant shifts in the structure and function of an ecosystem, often causing cascading effects throughout the entire area. In the context of fish species, keystone species can serve as either a primary or secondary source of food. As primary food sources, these species directly provide sustenance to fish through grazing, predation, or scavenging activities. For example, certain types of plankton serve as food for small fish, which are then consumed by larger fish, establishing a vital food chain. Moreover, many fish and invertebrates serve critical roles as predators and prey, contributing to the stability and diversity of aquatic ecosystems. As secondary sources of food, keystone species influence fish survival by supporting the overall health and productivity of an environment. For instance, some fish depend on the presence of coral reefs, mangrove forests, or aquatic plants to provide crucial feeding, breeding, and sheltering opportunities. These habitats are often maintained by keystone species, such as parrotfish, which help keep algae under control, allowing corals to grow and remain healthy. In conclusion, keystone species are essential components of many ecosystems, providing food directly or indirectly to a variety of fish species. Although \\"layers of fat\\" might be a source of energy for some fish, it is not the correct answer to the question of what serves as a source of food for many fish species. Keystone species and their vital influence on aquatic ecosystems are the more accurate and precise answer to this question."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers? is inside the article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists., can you guess it ?

In both sentences, the key subject is Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). The focus on Snowden and Russia is the main overlapping element between the two sentences. However, the first sentence, \\"Snowden asks to stay in Russia,\\" focuses on Snowden's request to remain in the country. This potentially refers to his application for temporary or permanent asylum, which was granted by the Russian government. The sentence emphasizes Snowden's desire to stay in the country and the legal process he needs to navigate. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Snowden releases first Russia video,\\" highlights Snowden's release of some form of content, most likely to the public or media. The \\"first Russia video\\" implies that there might be a series of videos or information released by Snowden with a specific focus on Russia. The main point in this sentence is Snowden's actions to share information rather than his stay in Russia. In conclusion, the two sentences share similar elements, such as the reference to Snowden and his connection with Russia.

(CNN) -- In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to \\"save\\" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a \\"death squad\\" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. \\"I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,\\" he said at the airport. \\"I have come to save Pakistan.\\" Last week,","completion":"Last week, Pervez Musharraf began rallying support and reaching out to his loyalists in a bid to reestablish his presence in Pakistan's political landscape. He has been holding meetings with key party leaders and members, discussing potential alliances and mapping out strategies to maximize his impact in the upcoming elections. Musharraf's return to Pakistan has resulted in a mixed response from the public, with some showing support for his commitment to restoring order in the country, while others condemn his past actions during his time in power and believe that he should face legal consequences for them. Despite the threats from the Taliban, Musharraf appears to be undeterred and determined to play an active role in shaping the future of Pakistan. He has called for unity amongst the different factions in the country, emphasizing the need for a stable and prosperous Pakistan. This sentiment has resonated with some Pakistanis who are disillusioned with the current state of the nation and believe that a strong, united front against corruption, extremism, and economic instability is necessary. In terms of policy, Musharraf's potential platform centers around key issues such as education reform, economic revitalization, counter-terrorism, and regional cooperation – all of which were focal points during his previous time in office. However, it remains to be seen whether he can regain the trust and support of the Pakistani people, given the various controversies that plagued his previous tenure. This includes the suspension of the constitution, the dismissal of the chief justice, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces on his watch. Musharraf's comeback attempt has also prompted discussions surrounding the role of the military in Pakistan's politics. During his time in power, Musharraf was often accused of undermining democratic institutions and consolidating power within the military establishment. Some political analysts argue that his return to the political arena could signal a resurgence of military influence in Pakistani politics, which may not bode well for the fragile democratic process in the country. Furthermore, by deciding to run for office, Musharraf knowingly puts himself at risk of facing the numerous criminal charges that await him, such as the high treason case related to the imposition of emergency rule in 2007. Nonetheless, Musharraf remains steadfast in his decision, hoping to leverage his previous experience and commitment to the nation to secure a foothold in the government. In conclusion, Pervez Musharraf's return to Pakistan and his decision to run for office have brought a myriad of reactions, discussions, and concerns to the forefront. While his ambition to \\"save\\" Pakistan serves as a rallying cry for some citizens, many remain skeptical of his intentions, and his potential return to power raises questions about the stability of Pakistan's political landscape and the ongoing struggle between civilian and military establishments. As the situation unfolds, it will be crucial to observe how Musharraf is received by the people, how he faces the legal challenges that await him, and whether he can initiate a new era of stability and progress in Pakistan, despite the looming threats and obstacles before him."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead, it is clear that Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate Quinn's new job. This act implies Skylar's desire to show support and share in the joy of Quinn's accomplishment. Thus, a more valid answer would highlight Skylar's intentions to congratulate and celebrate with Quinn. In order to better understand Skylar's reasoning, let's discuss the possible factors and emotions that could have motivated this decision: 1. Friendship: Skylar and Quinn are likely good friends, and celebrating together is an expression of that bond. It is common for friends to join in each other's happiness and share important milestones in life. 2. Recognition of achievement: Skylar understands that getting a new job is an important step for Quinn, and by organizing a celebration, Skylar is acknowledging and validating the significance of this event in Quinn's life. 3. Emotional support: Celebrating a new job together gives Skylar an opportunity to offer emotional support and encouragement to Quinn. This camaraderie can help ease the transition into a new position and bolster Quinn's confidence. 4. Social bonding: Taking Quinn to a new bar provides an opportunity for both friends to socialize, connect with others, and enjoy a fun, relaxed atmosphere together. This is an essential aspect of maintaining and strengthening friendships. 5. Creating memories: By choosing a new bar for the celebration, Skylar is adding an element of novelty and excitement to the experience. This allows both friends to create lasting memories of their time together, which they may cherish for years to come. In summary, \\"wanted to stay home\\" is not a valid answer to the question of why Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate the new job. Instead, the decision was likely driven by factors such as friendship, recognition of achievement, emotional support, social bonding, and the desire to create memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following context: The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard. Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? My ihome broke!","completion":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"My ihome broke!\\", one should first interpret the context, the user's emotions, tone, and the perspective from which they are sharing this information. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the underlying emotions, opinions, or attitudes within a piece of text, such as a tweet. In this case, there are several factors that can help us clarify the sentiment expressed: 1. Content: The tweet is about the user's iHome, which is an electronic device for playing music and charging smartphones, breaking down. The fact that the device no longer works implies that the user is facing an inconvenience or loss of functionality. 2. Tone: The exclamation mark at the end of the tweet suggests that the user is expressing strong emotions. Although the exclamation mark doesn't specify whether the emotion is positive or negative, considering the broken device, it's safe to assume that it represents a negative feeling, such as frustration or disappointment. 3. Emotion: From the content and tone, we can infer that the user is expressing dissatisfaction, distress, or annoyance because their iHome is broken, affecting their experience with the device and possibly their daily routine. 4. Perspective: The tweet is written in the first person, which means that the person experiencing the sentiment is the one posting the tweet. This personal perspective emphasizes the user's own emotional experience with the broken iHome. Taking all these factors into account, one could describe the sentiment of this tweet as predominantly negative due to the user's frustration, disappointment, or dissatisfaction about their broken iHome device. This sentiment might also evoke sympathy or empathy among readers who can relate to the experience of dealing with faulty technology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first question is about becoming rich in India, while the second question is about setting up a new political party in India and becoming Prime Minister. The answer to your initial inquiry is *no*, these questions address different topics. Now, let's address each question in detail. 1. What is the best way to become rich in India? There is no perfect formula for becoming wealthy, but here are some possible paths to accumulating wealth in India: a. Entrepreneurship: Starting your own business can be a path to wealth if you are able to identify and develop a unique idea. To be successful, you would need to conduct thorough market research, create a solid business plan, and work tirelessly to develop and expand the business. b. Real estate: Many wealthy individuals have built their fortunes through real estate investments, either by purchasing properties in upcoming locations and waiting for their value to increase, or by developing real estate themselves. c. Stock market investments: While investing in the stock market may require capital and involves risks, it is an avenue that has the potential for substantial returns if done wisely. d. Education and expertise: Acquiring an in-demand skill set or becoming an expert in a particular industry can lead to higher-paying job opportunities or enable you to open a successful consultancy firm. e. Passive income: Creating streams of passive income, such as writing a best-selling book, creating an app, or securing royalties from patents, may require initial effort and investment but can lead to long-term wealth accumulation. 2. What is the best way to set up a new political party in India and become PM? Becoming the Prime Minister of India involves setting up a political party and building public support. Here are some steps to consider: a. Familiarize yourself with the existing political landscape and identify the gaps or weaknesses that your new party can address. b. Develop a clear and coherent party ideology and platform. This should cover a range of social, economic, and political issues, as well as providing concrete solutions to the problems your party aims to address. c. Form a core group of committed individuals who share your vision and are willing to take on various responsibilities within the party organization. d. Register the new political party with the Election Commission of India to obtain official recognition. e. Build a strong party infrastructure that includes a central office, state and district offices, as well as local units. This will enable your party to function efficiently and maintain grassroots connections. f. Develop a sound campaign strategy that focuses on effective communication of your party's message, identifying vote banks, and connecting with the wider public. g. Work to gain support by participating in local and national elections. Winning seats in various levels of government will help solidify your party's presence and establish its credibility. h. As the leader of the political party, you should strive to develop your image as a capable, trustworthy, and far-sighted statesperson. Building credibility and public trust would be essential to your bid for the Prime Minister's position.

Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois.

In January 2019, Howard Schultz, who had stepped down as Starbucks CEO in 2017 and left the Starbucks board in June 2018, began publicly discussing a potential independent bid for the U.S. presidency in 2020. Schultz's potential candidacy was met with mixed views from various political analysts and public figures, but his prospective run, particularly as an independent candidate, caught the attention of Michael Bloomberg. Michael Bloomberg, who had been the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, is a billionaire and an influential political figure himself. He had previously weighed multiple times running for president as an independent candidate. During the 2016 presidential election, he had explored a presidential run, but ultimately decided against it amid concerns that a third-party candidate could potentially divide the Democratic vote and put then-Republican candidate Trump in office. In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Bloomberg ultimately decided to run as a Democratic candidate but suspended his campaign after the Super Tuesday primaries in March 2020 and endorsed Joe Biden. When Bloomberg learned about Howard Schultz's potential presidential run as an independent candidate in 2020, he was not pleased, as he was concerned that an independent candidacy could potentially help President Donald Trump get re-elected by splitting the Democratic vote. Despite Schultz positioning himself as a \\"centrist independent candidate\\" and voicing concerns about the polarizing nature of American politics, Bloomberg still saw it as a potential threat to the Democratic Party's chances for success in the election. This prompted Bloomberg to make the blunt remark, asking, \\"Who the f**k is he?\\" in response to Schultz's potential candidacy. Ultimately, Howard Schultz decided to abandon his exploration of a presidential run, citing concerns about increasing polarization and the risk of inadvertently assisting in Trump's re-election as reasons for his decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the author say about the Australian sun? Answer:","completion":"The author stated that the Australian sun is severe and causes a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. As a result, the majority of people living in Australia will likely have sun-damaged skin due to the country's sun-drenched climate."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization.

Part #2: Analyze the update and identify if it's providing additional context that supports or undermines the general hypothesis.

It shows that the situation is not entirely the person's fault for not being in touch with their family, and gives a plausible reason for not staying connected."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days. First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie. I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder... Second, indie films are supposed to be about real people. There's nothing real in this film.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The space shuttle—and any other rocket-based system—uses chemical reactions to propel itself into space and maneuver itself when it gets into orbit. The rockets that lift the orbiter are of two different types. The three main engines are powered by reacting liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen to generate water. Then there are the two solid rocket boosters, which use a solid fuel mixture that contains mainly ammonium perchlorate and powdered aluminum. The chemical reaction between these substances produces aluminum oxide, water, nitrogen gas, and hydrogen chloride. Although the solid rocket boosters each have a significantly lower mass than the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks, they provide over 80% of the lift needed to put the shuttle into orbit—all because of chemical reactions.

Liberty United, a company that transforms guns and ammunition seized by police into wearable art, is taking on firearms one gun and bullet at a time. The company was co-founded in 2013 by entrepreneur Peter Thum and his wife, “Mad Men” actress Cara Buono. The idea: creating jewelry from weapons that will never fire again. Each piece is printed with the serial number of the firearm from which it was cast. It’s like an upscale, gun-control version of the Livestrong bracelet. The smelted remains of Winchester rifles and Smith and Wessons, formerly used in crimes, find new life as rings, bracelets, earrings, cufflinks and necklaces. Products range from 35 for a brass bullet shell charm to 3,895 for a necklace comprised of gun steel plated in rhodium, rose gold, hematite or 14K, and set with pearls and sapphires. Amy Schumer tweets underwear-less pic for gun violence awareness “I’m wearing my @LibertyUTD spike necklace that’s made from a gun,” tweeted actor Alan Cumming in 2013. “Proceeds help end gun violence.” Wearing a piece of Liberty United bling puts you in the company of celebrities like Cumming, Paul Rudd, Cara Delevingne and Sarah Silverman. But the company also delivers real-world results for residents of bullet-ridden communities where the guns were confiscated. At checkout, customers can choose to direct their donations to one or all of four partner communities: Newburgh or Syracuse, N.Y., Philadelphia, Pa., and Cook County, Illinois. About a quarter of the proceeds from jewelry sales are donated to after-school programs and recreation centers. The money helps provide safe havens to learn and play for about 2,000 children and young adults in at-risk communities. “These kids are really hopeful and excited about life,\\" Thum said. “But when we talk about gun violence, they can all name someone who was killed.” Empire State Building glows orange for gun violence awareness In 2015, Newburgh had the highest violent crime rate of any city in New York state. Philadelphia has suffered nearly 20,000 gun-related crimes since 2014. Lieutenant Thomas Mcartney, the commanding officer of the evidence unit for the Philadelphia Police Department, estimates the police destroy between five and 12,000 weapons a year. Liberty United offers police a way to create value from weapons disposal. “You’re taking a destructive item that has been used in a crime or incident and turning it into something not only beautiful but purposeful,” said Julie Wertheimer, chief of staff for criminal justice in Philadelphia’s Managing Director’s Office. Liberty United recently expanded its program to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, which patrols the gun-plagued streets of South Side Chicago. Gun Violence Awareness draws gun control, anti-violence pleas “In Englewood, the school is locked and has armed guards all day,” Thum said. He added that the funded programs provide students “extended hours of safety when they might otherwise be headed home without supervision.” Thum sold Ethos Water, a socially conscious bottled water company, to Starbucks in 2005 for 8 million. His interest in fighting gun violence arose from subsequent trips to war-torn regions of Southern and Central Africa. Thum created Fonderie 47, a jewelry and watch boutique that works with designers James de Givency, Philip Crangi, Adrian Glessing and David Candaux to create luxury pieces from reclaimed uzis and AK47s. Since that company's launch in 2011, it has helped destroy some 50,000 guns collected through buy-back programs. With his latest initiative, Thum said he wants to encourage Americans to speak against gun violence. “I would suggest they take action in whatever form they can,” he said.","completion":"A company called Liberty United, co-founded in 2013 by entrepreneur Peter Thum and his wife, Mad Men actress Cara Buono, is transforming guns and ammunition seized by police into wearable art to combat gun violence.

Title: Schindler's List Movie plot: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all. Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Göth and, through Stern's attention to bribery,...

Background: Mojo is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those featuring the X-Men family of characters. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams, Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), as the titular hero's archenemy, and subsequently a villain to the X-Men and their various sub-groups as well. Mojo is one of the \\"Spineless Ones,\\" an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology. Context: At the time she wrote the Longshot miniseries, writer Ann Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. (A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special, was also born of these works.) Artist Art Adams designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening. The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor Malcolm McDowell on Late Night with David Letterman, in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the Ludovico technique scene in A Clockwork Orange had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair. Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues. The character subsequently appeared in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). That same year, in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include Marvel Comics Presents #89 (1991), The Uncanny X-Men Annual #15 (1991), Wolverine #52 (March 1992), X-Men #6 (March 1992), Wolverine #53 (April 1992), X-Men #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July-August 1992), The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16 (Annual 1992), Marvel Comics Presents #119 (1993), What If? #59 (March 1994), X-Men Adventures: Season Two #11 (December 1994), Marvel: Portraits of the Universe #1 (March 1995), X-Men: Mutations #1 (1996), Youngblood/X-Force #1 (July 1996), X-Force/Youngblood #1 (August 1996), X-Force #60-61 (November-December 1996), The Adventures of the X-Men #9-10 (1996-January 1997), X-Babies: Murderama #1 (January 1998), X-Force #76 (April 1998), X-Babies Reborn #1 (January 2000), X-Men Unlimited #32 (September 2001), Exiles #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), The Uncanny X-Men #460-461 (August 2005), and Exiles #73-74 (February 2006).

The fort visible from the Cooper River was notable for battles in what war? Answer:","completion":"The fort visible from the Cooper River that is notable for battles is Fort Sumter, and it played a significant role in the American Civil War (1861-1865). Located in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, near the mouth of the Cooper River, Fort Sumter remains a potent symbol of the conflict between the Union and Confederate forces. The construction of Fort Sumter began in 1829 as a part of the Third System of coastal fortifications initiated by the United States government. It was named after General Thomas Sumter, a renowned military leader during the American Revolutionary War. The fort was built using labor from enslaved African Americans, which gives an important historical context to its role in the war. Fort Sumter gained national prominence when it became a focal point of the crisis leading up to the American Civil War. The fort assumed strategic importance for both Union and Confederate forces because of its location in Charleston Harbor. As tensions increased between the Northern and Southern states over issues such as states' rights and slavery, the fate of Fort Sumter became a symbol of the broader political divide in the country. The first battle of the American Civil War took place at Fort Sumter from April 12th to 14th, 1861. The Union garrison stationed at the fort, commanded by Major Robert Anderson, had been cut off from vital supplies and reinforcements. The Confederate forces, under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard, demanded the surrender of the fort. When Anderson refused, the Confederate artillery opened fire, initiating a 34-hour bombardment. Ultimately, the Union forces surrendered, signaling the beginning of the Civil War. Fort Sumter changed hands several times during the war, reflecting the larger struggle between Union and Confederate forces. The fort's strategic importance was clear to both sides as it provided a crucial foothold in the Confederate's stronghold. Throughout the war, numerous attempts were made to reinforce, besiege, and recapture the fort. Its battered walls and ruined masonry bore witness to the devastation wrought by the conflict. In February 1865, Confederate forces abandoned Fort Sumter as General William T. Sherman advanced into South Carolina during his infamous \\"March to the Sea\\". The fort was eventually retaken by Union troops on April 14, 1865, just days before the war's end. Today, Fort Sumter is a national monument maintained by the National Park Service. The fort remains a tangible reminder of the American Civil War and serves as an important historical site for visitors who want to understand the pivotal role it played in the conflict."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: What was the weather like?

Contacting listing agents and property managers: To get more information or schedule a tour, you would have reached out to the appropriate individuals and agencies responsible for managing or selling the properties on your list. This may involve providing some personal information to those agents or property managers, such as your name, current living situation, and desired move-in date. Ensuring proper communication plays a significant role in getting timely appointments and accurate information. 4. Scheduling tours: You would have spent time arranging tours to view properties in-person. By taking the time to visit each option, you can get a better sense of the living space, neighborhood, and overall suitability to your needs and preferences. Taking photos or notes during each tour can be helpful in recalling specific details when evaluating your options later. 5.

It was created in May 1914 by the purchase of \\"Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke\\" by Camillo Castiglioni, who relocated the factory from Liebau to Brandenburg an der Havel. Brandenburg's chief designer, Ernst Heinkel was retained by the new enterprise. By Autumn 1915, it had become the largest aircraft manufacturer in Germany, with a capital of 1,500,000 Marks, 1,000 employees, and two more factories - one in Rummelsburg, Berlin, and one in Wandsbek, Hamburg. - Dr. Ernst Heinkel (January 24, 1888 January 30, 1958) was a German aircraft designer, manufacturer, Wehrwirtschaftsführer in the Third Reich, and member of the Nazi party.

The aircraft was produced under license by Aero both during the war , and afterwards ( when it became known as the Aero Ae 01 ) , and also by Letov , as Š10 . Experience gained with this design would provide Aero with the basis for a number of derivative civil and military designs throughout the 1920s . The design formed the basis for the C.I and C.II armed reconnaissance types . - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Context: Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher, 15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", and \\"In the Still of the Night\\". \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's \\"It's O.K.\\" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled The Beach Boys. The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, \\"[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep\\", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's \\"Good Vibrations\\". For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album The Beach Boys Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian later called Love You one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that \\"That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.\\" Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having \\"the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother.\\" Love You peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop. Referring to \\"naysayers\\" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote, \\"Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" The A.V. Club - considering the album in \\"the same vein\\" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You as: \\"something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson - like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art - one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview.\\" In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \\"rock bands\\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \\"the wrong element\\", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, \\"...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element.\\" Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, \\"They're my friends and I like their music\\". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had \\"shot himself in the foot\\". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. In 1985, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of \\"California Girls\\". \\"Getcha Back\\", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\" (U.S., No. 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song \\"Wipe Out\\" and filming a music video. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK. By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. No. 1 hit single in 22 years with \\"Kokomo\\", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. They released the album Still Cruisin, which went gold in the U.S. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, had no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker Eugene Landy. A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded 25 million for unpaid royalties. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning 13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love. In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording Howdy From Maui, and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian acted as co-producer. Question: what is the most important fact listed in the article? Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to pinpoint a single most important fact in the article as it covers a wide range of significant events related to The Beach Boys' history. However, one could argue that a key milestone for the band was Brian Wilson's return to prominence with the 1976 album '15 Big Ones,' which marked his reemergence as a major creative force within the group. Additionally, the band's continued influence and success through the 1980s, particularly their resurgence with the hit single \\"Kokomo\\" in 1988, demonstrates their enduring impact on the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The kingdoms of France and Scotland had traditionally enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship, reflected in a defensive treaty signed between the two kingdoms in 1512. When Henry crossed the English Channel to campaign in France, the King of France activated the treaty, sending arms, money and military advisers to James IV of Scotland to encourage him to fulfil his obligations, in the hope that this would draw English resources away from the invasion of France. James crossed the border with a force of some 35,000 men, including 5,000 French advisers. He was opposed by an English force under the Earl of Surrey. The two sides met on September 9, 1513, near the village of Flodden. The Scottish army was heavily defeated, losing some 9,000 men and many nobles, including King James, the King's illegitimate son, and twelve earls. Answer this question based on the article: How many men did James IV cross the border with who were not French advisers?","completion":"James IV of Scotland crossed the border with a force of approximately 35,000 men, which included 5,000 French advisers. To find out how many men were not French advisers, we can subtract the number of French advisers from the total number of men in the army. 35,000 men (total force) - 5,000 (French advisers) = 30,000 men So, James IV crossed the border with 30,000 men who were not French advisers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, what causes weathering? Choices: [-] swea. [-] Winter. [-] wind. [-] rivers. [-] CO 2. [-] sand. [-] peat. [-] ice. Answer:","completion":"Weathering is a natural process that breaks down rocks, minerals, and other landforms over time due to various factors. Given the facts that wind causes erosion and water erosion has similar consequences as wind erosion, we can determine that multiple factors cause weathering. Let's analyze the different choices: 1. Wind - Wind is a significant factor. It causes wind erosion, where tiny particles carried by the wind dislodge and wear down rock surfaces over a long period. This factor contributes to weathering. 2. Rivers - Rivers are another contributing factor to weathering. As rivers flow, they cause water erosion, where the movement of water gradually breaks apart the rocks and soil particles. This factor is responsible for forming various landscapes and changing the appearance of rocks over time. 3. CO2 - Carbon dioxide (CO2) can also contribute to weathering, but not by itself. In a chemical process called carbonation, CO2 combines with water to form a weak acid, which then reacts with minerals in rocks, causing them to weather. 4. Sand - Sand can be a factor in abrasion, which is the mechanical scraping of rock surfaces by friction between rocks and moving particles initiated by wind and water erosion processes. It is a subtype of erosion. 5. Ice - Ice, specifically in the process of freeze-thaw weathering, is a significant factor. When water enters the cracks of rocks and then freezes, it expands and puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the rock, causing it to break and weather over time. 6. Peat - Peat doesn't directly contribute to weathering. It is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that takes place under conditions of waterlogging and poor nutrient availability. However, it signifies an environment that may be conducive to other weathering processes. 7. Winter - Winter can be a factor in weathering, particularly when it comes to freeze-thaw cycles. As mentioned in the ice point, the fluctuation in temperature during winter months can lead to the repeated freezing and thawing of water in rock cracks, which can cause the rock to weaken and eventually break apart. 8. Swea - This term is not relevant to the process of weathering. In conclusion, wind, rivers, CO2, sand, ice, and winter are all factors that can contribute to weathering. Each factor can work independently or in combination with others to break down rocks and other materials over time. The process of weathering mainly involves physical (mechanical) factors such as wind and ice and chemical factors such as CO2, resulting in various landscapes and geological features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi seemed increasingly cornered Sunday as security forces defected to the opposition in a town near the capital and the United Nations Security Council voted for tough restrictions on and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. Former security forces said they had switched sides and joined the opposition in Zawiya, a town about 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital, Tripoli. Some buildings in Zawiya showed signs of damage, including a freshly burned-out police station. CNN's Nic Robertson, on a government-organized trip to Zawiya, saw armed civilians taking defensive positions on rooftops to prepare for a possible effort by Gadhafi loyalists to retake the town. About 2,000 people took part in an anti-government protest there, some standing atop tanks or holding anti-aircraft guns. They said they wanted the government overthrown, calling Gadhafi a \\"bloodsucker.\\" Later in the day, CNN witnessed two smaller pro-government rallies that had apparently been organized by government officials for international journalists to see, Robertson reported. The opposition now controls several Libyan cities after weeks of protests inspired by demonstrations that toppled longtime leaders in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. Gadhafi criticized the U.N. Security Council resolution Sunday, telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members \\"took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad.\\" He added, \\"If the Security Council wants to know about something, they should have sent a fact-finding committee.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo, asset freeze, and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- form \\"one of the speediest international responses to a government targeting its own people.\\" \\"We recognize the killings are ongoing,\\" Clinton told reporters en route to a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Switzerland. \\"We recognize we need to advance the humanitarian, the military, judicial, and even forensic planning already under way.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron and British Foreign Secretary William Hague both called on Gadhafi on Sunday to go. \\"Libya's future has no future with him at the helm,\\" Cameron said. \\"Absolutely none.\\" Britain also announced it was freezing the assets of Gadhafi, five of his children, and those acting on their behalf. Gadhafi's son, Saif, denied the government used force on its own people. In an interview that ran Sunday with Christiane Amanpour for ABC's \\"This Week,\\" he was asked about numerous reports of attacks by government forces on civilians. \\"Show me a single attack,\\" he said. \\"Show me a single bomb. Show me a single casualty. The Libyan air force destroyed just the ammunition sites.\\" The younger Gadhafi -- who is a prominent member of the government -- also played down anti-government protests. Just because \\"10,000 or 5,000 people\\" demonstrate against his father, he said, doesn't mean the entire population is against him. He had harsh words, however, for the Libyan diplomats who have turned their backs on his father, calling them \\"hypocrites.\\" \\"If you are strong, they love you. If not, they say goodbye. That is good. We get rid of them,\\" he told Amanpour. Meanwhile, Gadhafi's nurse went home to Ukraine. Galyna Kolotnytska gained notoriety in November after WikiLeaks released a cable from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli describing Gadhafi's almost obsessive reliance on the woman, described as a \\"voluptuous blonde.\\" Kolotnytska's daughter told CNN on Sunday her mother had returned but was not commenting. Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition as tens of thousands surged towards the country that triggered the series of Arab world revolts. About 100,000 people have fled violence in Libya in the past week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. CNN witnessed the Tunisian army, charities and ordinary Tunisians trying to help Libyans on the border. Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food, water, and even the use of phones. The Tunisian government reported Saturday that 40,000 people had crossed its borders since February 20, while Egypt reported 55,000 had crossed over since February 19, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday. The evacuees include Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans, and many from Asian countries. About 10,000 fled from Libya to Tunisia on Saturday, the Red Crescent said. \\"Very large numbers of people amassed in the no man's land between Libya and Tunisia in extremely cold conditions,\\" Red Crescent spokesman Joe Lowry told CNN on Sunday. \\"People stood in the queue for six hours with no food, water, or access to sanitation.\\" The Red Crescent is affiliated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. At least four people were carried away in stretchers because of crush injuries and several lost consciousness as a result of the chaos. \\"It was very worrying to see women passing their babies in cots over the crowd to keep them from harm,\\" Lowry said. There were also chaotic scenes in Tripoli as people rushed to banks to claim a government handout of 500 dinars (just over 400) per family. There were also long lines in Zawiya. Pharmacies in Tripoli were running out of blood pressure and diabetes medicines, a source in the capital told CNN. Gadhafi has showed no sign of relinquishing power. Sunday, the world waited to see whether the threat of sanctions will have any effect on a country where the death toll from the recent unrest has topped 1,000, according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Saturday night, the United Nations Security Council voted 15-0 on the draft resolution, which also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court. Gadhafi and others could face an investigation for potential war crimes. \\"This resolution will be a signal (to) put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence,\\" said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham, Libyan ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier Saturday, he renounced support for Gadhafi, calling him \\"a leader who loves nobody but himself.\\" Hours before the Security Council's vote Saturday, Libya's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader. Libya's deputy ambassador to the world body, Ibrahim Dabbashi, indicated that he and fellow diplomats support \\"in principle\\" a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil. City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli, according to Amal Bogagies, a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising, and a separate Libyan opposition source. Both are based in Benghazi, the eastern city that is under the control of the opposition. Jalil was in Gadhafi's government until Monday, when he quit to protest the \\"bloody situation\\" and \\"use of excessive force\\" against unarmed protesters, according to Libyan newspaper Quryna. Protests began February 15 in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. At least several other cities are now thought to be under opposition control, according to eyewitnesses. There have been numerous reports of widespread violence -- some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and security forces loyal to Gadhafi, and some by protesters. While CNN has staff in some cities, the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya. CNN has also compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses.

Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \\"irrefutable evidence\\" that \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \\"three-note motif\\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \\"This Game We Play\\" was submitted to MGM. Question: What were the last names of the two people who composed The World is Not Enough?

Identify the main elements of the sentence: \\"but\\" as a conjunction, \\"it\\" as a subject pronoun, \\"has to be\\" as a verb phrase, and \\"the starting point\\" as the main object. 2. Find the Finnish equivalents for these elements: \\"mutta\\" for \\"but\\", \\"sen\\" for \\"it\\", \\"täytyy olla\\" for \\"has to be\\", and \\"aloituspiste\\" for \\"the starting point\\". 3. Combine these elements in a sentence that follows Finnish syntax. In Finnish, the subject pronoun (\\"it\\" in this case) usually comes before the verb, followed by the object.

Continue writing the following text. While on the ship, the woman looked out of the porthole instead of the window, because the Choices: (1). porthole was blocked. (2). window was blocked.","completion":"While on the ship, the woman looked out of the porthole instead of the window, because the window was blocked. Often times, when cruise ships embark on long journeys, unexpected situations can arise causing some of the facilities and amenities on board to be temporarily unavailable or obstructed. In this case, the lack of a clear view through the window prompted the woman to make use of the porthole for a glimpse of the breathtaking oceanic scenery. In addition to the stunning views they can offer, portholes serve various purposes on seafaring vessels. They not only allow natural light to stream into cabins, but also provide proper air circulation and help maintain a comfortable cabin temperature for passengers. Functioning as an essential structural and safety feature, portholes on modern vessels are constructed with high-quality materials and come in watertight designs to offer reliability and peace of mind. The woman, intrigued and enthralled by the vastness of the ocean, was able to make the most out of her situation by employing the porthole. As she peered through the small, round opening, she found herself immersing in the beauty and tranquility of the endless horizon. The sparkling surface of the water stretching far and wide appeared to be an ethereal painting, inviting the viewer to get lost in its depth. Gazing at the occasional seabirds gliding effortlessly through the sky, the woman pondered over the majesty of nature and the role human beings play in its protection and conservation. She recalled tales of ancient seafarers and explorers, who once embarked on mighty voyages that expanded global knowledge and human understanding of the world's oceans. Embracing serendipity, she marveled at how the mere obstruction of a window led her to experience a moment of profound reflection and appreciation of the power of nature. Her porthole view presented opportunities to witness the vast palette of colors that painted the sky during sunrise and sunset, further enriching her soul. As dusk approached, the woman would observe the merging of reds, oranges, and purples as day seamlessly turned to night. The twilight transformed the water's surface from a shimmering expanse of light to a deep, dark canvass bearing the reflection of countless stars. When night finally settled, the woman was delighted to discover that the porthole served as her personal telescope to the cosmos. With the window blocked, she found that her eyes became better adjusted to the darkness, enabling her to gaze at the constellations formed by the stars adorning the night sky. This provided her with moments of real connection to the celestial bodies, history, and mythology. Without realizing, the woman's initial disappointment in the obstructed window transformed into gratitude for this compelling alternative. The humble porthole had become her portal to the vastness of the ocean and cosmos, and it awakened her to the interconnectedness of the universe. No longer was the woman focused on the inconvenience caused by the blocked window; instead, she embraced the porthole as a unique opportunity to witness the grandeur of the natural world, and to reflect on her own life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have paid out more than I earned in the past. I have been stingy occasionally and been sorry later. My biggest regret about money, however, is regarding savings. When I was 30 years old, I started saving money. Finally, I had a well-paid job with a salary that would grow with time and seniority. I purchased my home and moved in. The next logical step was to save money. So I did. In one year I put away 5,000. My goal was to build another 5,000 and start investing . I was pleased with my progress. Unfortunately, life stepped in. A family member became disabled and needed financial assistance. I could not seem to control my spending, and my checking account ran dry. My credit card bills rose. I carry no regret to any necessities that I bought for my family. However, as I look back, I realize that I did not research enough about balancing my budget before spending my savings account. I used the money to buy fast food just for convenience. I would go to the store for food when my cupboards were still not empty, because I wanted something special. I bought convenient items to save time, not considering that I was wasting money. I should have given up the name brand paper towels and used more dish rags. My 5,000 was gone quickly.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the amount of men that represented 30 percent of the village of Little Thetford's population in 1911?, using the article: The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911. Two villagers won Distinguished Conduct Medals. Thirteen villagers—over six percent of the..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, 61 men from the village of Little Thetford were sent to fight in the First World War. This number represented over 30 percent of the village's population in 1911. To calculate the population of Little Thetford in 1911, we can use the given information to create a simple equation. Let P represent the total population of Little Thetford in 1911, then 61 men would equal 30 percent of the population, which can be mathematically represented as: 61 = 0.30 * P To find P (total population), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30: P = 61 / 0.30 P = 203.33 (approximately) Since the population must be a whole number, we can either round up or down. In this case, rounding up would make more sense because the article states that 61 men represent \\"over\\" 30 percent of the population. Therefore, we can assume the total population of Little Thetford in 1911 was approximately 204. Now, to find the exact number of men representing 30 percent of the population, we can simply multiply 30 percent (0.30) by the total population (204): Number of men = 0.30 * 204 Number of men = 61.2 Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we can assume that the number of men representing 30 percent of the village population in 1911 was approximately 61, which corresponds with the information given in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.

William was more honest and trustworthy. II. Steven was more honest and trustworthy.","completion":"I. William was more honest and trustworthy. The mistake was a simple one, but it had colossal ramifications that neither William nor Steven could have foreseen. William, a tall, lean man in his mid-thirties, had a reputation for his honesty, dedication, and hard work in the company. As a natural leader with a good moral compass, his colleagues and superiors alike admired him. Steven, on the other hand, was viewed with suspicion. His hunger for success constantly made him toe the line, causing those around him to question his moral compass. When the top-secret test results fell into William's hands, he felt an uneasy chill creep down his spine. These test results contained the data needed to evaluate an experimental drug's success - a drug with the potential to save countless lives. The slightest unethical decision could bring the deck of cards crashing down, so it was crucial that only the most honest and trustworthy individuals handle such sensitive information. Finding himself in a moral quandary, William decided to confront Steven. Strolling up to him, the expression etched on William's face spoke of his unease. Suspicion crackled in the air, sending ripples of tension between the two. After an uncomfortable conversation that seemed to stretch into eternity, William reluctantly handed over the results. With these results now firmly in Steven's possession, the room seemed to breathe again. The overbearing hesitation that had clouded William's decision dissipated, leaving an odd sense of resolve between the two men. They now knew that they must work in tandem to ensure the project’s success while navigating the perils of corporate morality. Though the situation was fraught with complexities, William's unwavering foresightedness and Steven's newfound sense of responsibility were beginning to align. They found themselves making genuine progress, driven by a common goal – the greater good of humanity. It appeared as though the ripple effect from this simple mistake would bear a positive impact on the company, the project, and perhaps even themselves. Soon, the experimental drug was on the cusp of approval, sending the medical world into a frenzy of anticipation. William's ethical leanings steered the project with a steady hand, ensuring transparency and clear communication throughout the process. At the same time, Steven's keen eye for opportunity kept the project afloat amid the ever-evolving pharmaceutical landscape. The initial mistake, having the top-secret results end up in the hands of William, would ultimately prove to be a blessing in disguise. The combination of these two very different individuals, bound together by extraordinary circumstances, would ensure that their company played a significant role in changing the course of history. The drug went on to save thousands of lives, and the once-divided pair found common ground in their shared desire to make a difference. Together, William and Steven became the embodiment of progress, bringing hope and healing to countless people. And thus, the story of William and Steven serves as a reminder to us all - sometimes, a simple mistake based on someone's strengths and weaknesses can set the stage for something far greater than we could have ever imagined."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The striker laid the ball off to McAlinden, whose penetrating run caused panic in the Imps defence before he fed the ball back to Reid to drill a powerful shot into the roof of the net from 15 yards. Pierce Sweeney almost made it 2-0 with a spectacular effort while at the other end, substitute Harry Anderson saw an effort deflect just wide as Exeter held on for the win to move up to second in the table.

After graduating from Cretin High School, he was selected in the 28th round of the 1974 free agent draft as a pitcher by the St. Louis Cardinals, but opted instead to attend college at the University of Minnesota. He was a three-year starter for the Golden Gophers, earning All American honors as a shortstop for his sophomore and junior years. Between his junior and senior seasons, Molitor suffered a broken jaw. Molitor began as a shortstop, then moved to second base when Robin Yount returned from a brief injury. He made his MLB debut in 1978, playing in 125 games and hitting .273 with 6 home runs, 45 RBIs and 30 stolen bases. In 1981, he spent time at center field and right field to avoid the injuries associated with infield play. Molitor was moved to third base before the 1982 season. Molitor was part of a young Milwaukee Brewers team that lost the 1982 World Series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals. Molitor batted .355 during the series. In Game 1, he had five hits, a World Series record. During the 1982 season, he hit .302 and led the American League (AL) with 136 runs scored. On May 12, he hit three home runs against the Royals in a 9-7 loss. Molitor struggled with injuries for much of his early career, being placed on the disabled list six times between 1980 and 1986. In 1984, Molitor struggled with elbow problems, played in only 13 games and ultimately underwent surgery in an attempt to salvage his career. He played in 140 games in 1985, hitting .297 with 10 home runs and 48 RBIs. He followed that with a .281 average, 9 home runs and 55 RBI in 1986. That year he suffered a hamstring injury, returned for a few days, then reinjured it. He played in 105 games that season. Molitor attracted national media attention in 1987 during his 39-game hitting streak. Near the end of the streak, columnist Mike Downey wrote that \\"the amazing thing about Paul Molitor's recent bat-o-rama is not that he has hit in 33 straight games but that he has played in 33 straight games.\\" The streak ended with Molitor in the on-deck circle when Rick Manning got a game-ending hit to beat the Cleveland Indians on August 26, 1987. Fans booed Manning for driving in the winning run and thus depriving Molitor of one last chance to reach 40 games. The streak stands as the fifth-longest in modern-day baseball history, and remains the longest since Pete Rose's 44-game hit streak in 1978.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did paul join the brewers?","completion":"Paul joined the Brewers in 1978."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pattern will also act as the backing on the bow tie, so use something sturdy that also able to be worn comfortably. Ideal backing includes cardboard from a cereal package, poster board or thin plastic folder covers.","completion":"To create the pattern, begin by downloading a mustache silhouette or drawing one freehand that matches your preferred size and style. Next, print or trace the mustache silhouette onto a sheet of paper, ensuring that the dimensions are to scale to fit comfortably around the wearer's neck. Now, create the bow tie pattern by adding an elongated, symmetrical oval-shaped silhouette along the bottom of the mustache where the two ends will connect to form the bow. This shape should be curved upward at its center and taper towards both ends, creating a visual balance between the mustache and bow tie elements. Once you have the entire pattern drawn out, carefully cut around the edges of the mustache and bow tie shape using a pair of sharp scissors. This paper template will serve as your guide for cutting the backing material. Choose your backing - cardboard from a cereal package, poster board, or thin plastic folder covers - and trace the pattern onto it using a pencil or fine tip marker. After tracing, cut out the backing material with precision along the outline. Now that you have your mustache and bow tie backing, gather some fabric material such as cotton, silk, or polyester, depending on the desired durability and formality of the bow tie. Ensure that the fabric is large enough to cover the entire backing piece. Carefully attach the fabric to the backing using non-toxic fabric glue, double-sided tape, or even sewing, keeping in mind that edges must be smooth and even. Gently press the fabric onto the backing, ensuring that there are no wrinkles or bubbles, and allow it to dry or set firmly. While the glue or adhesive dries, cut out a rectangular strip of fabric, approximately two inches wide and long enough to loop around the wearer's neck comfortably, creating the bow tie's neck strap. Attach this strap to the back of the mustache bow tie by gluing or stitching each end on either side of the bowtie's center, ensuring that it does not interfere with the overall appearance of the mustache silhouette. To add a finishing touch to your mustache bow tie, consider attaching a decorative centerpiece to the front, where the bow tie and mustache meet. This could be a small button, fabric rosette, or jewel, depending on your preferred aesthetic and overall style. Attach this embellishment using strong adhesive or thread to ensure it stays in place. Once all components are securely fastened, allow everything to dry and set completely before attempting to wear or adjust the mustache bow tie. And there you have it - your custom-made, creative mustache bow tie is now ready to be worn and enjoyed at various events or gatherings, adding a unique and quirky touch to any outfit!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Risk communication guidelines widely used in public health are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk, which focuses on risk perception at the level of individuals. However, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies are more than public health events and occur in a highly charged political, social and economic environment. This study examines other sociological and cultural approaches from scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas for insights on how to communicate in such environments. It recommends developing supplemental tools for outbreak communication to deal with issues such as questions of blame and fairness in risk distribution and audiences who do not accept biomedical explanations of disease.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sequester: Obama to Return Part of Salary Yesterday I wrote that the lucky ducks in Congress are exempt from the sequester. Head Start programs are cutting back; the White House furloughed 480 people; but Congressional salaries will remain intact, because they’re not appropriated by Congress or included in presidential budgets. Lawmakers could pass a bill cutting their salaries—yes, commenters, I know about the 27th amendment, the cut wouldn’t go into effect until the next session—but they haven’t. Alternatively, individual members of Congress could sign over some portion of their wages to the Treasury. Guess who’s doing just that. President Obama announced today that he would give 5 percent of his salary to the Treasury. The president wants “to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester,” an administration official said. He probably got the idea from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his deputy, Ashton B.

Foil: Foil, especially aluminum foil, can be easily crumpled and then carefully reopened. It is a thin sheet that is very malleable and can be changed from a smooth shape to a compacted one by applying physical force. 2. Hair: Hair can also be physically manipulated to change its shape, such as when you style or curl it.

Dirt and Soils: Dirt and soils can be physically compressed and compacted through force, such as when you step on it or press it into a shape. However, the other options (roads, H2O, wood, and oxygen) are less likely to change from smooth to compacted by physical force: - Roads: Roads are generally a hard surface made of materials like asphalt or concrete, and it would be challenging to crumple them physically without significant force or specific equipment. - H2O (water): Water cannot be crumpled because it is a liquid and takes the shape of its container. Compacting it by physical force is not possible as it will simply disperse or flow to another location. - Wood: Wood is a solid, and while its shape can be altered through cutting and carving, it cannot be crumpled easily by applying physical force. - Oxygen: Oxygen is a gas, and it cannot be crumpled or compacted simply by applying physical force.

Q:I read this background article the other day: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. I am facing a new situation today: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, the soil in the grassland of Kenya would be expected to have a thicker A horizon compared to the forested area of Tanzania. The key points mentioned in the article that lead to this conclusion include: 1. Grasslands have deep, fibrous root systems that contribute significant amounts of organic matter to the soil. In contrast, much of the organic matter in forests comes from fallen leaves on the forest floor. 2. Fires are more frequent in grasslands, which destroy aboveground plant materials but stimulate greater contributions from roots. This leads to a higher incorporation of organic matter in the grassland soil. 3. Forest soils have greater acidity, which inhibits the action of soil organisms that would mix surface litter into the mineral soil. This results in a more shallow penetration of organic matter in forest soils. Therefore, given these distinguishing factors between grassland and forest soils, the Kenyan grassland would generally have a thicker A horizon (with a deeper distribution of organic matter), while the Tanzanian forest, with its higher acidity and reliance on leaf litter for organic matter, would typically have a thinner A horizon, storing most organic matter in the O horizon (forest floor) and the thin A horizon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Math Problem Solve -265*f + 558*f = 244*f + 490 for f.","completion":"To solve for f in the given equation -265*f + 558*f = 244*f + 490, we will first combine the terms with the variable (f) on both sides of the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side: -265*f + 558*f = (558 - 265)*f = 293*f On the right side: The term 244*f is the only term with 'f', and 490 is a constant. There is no need to combine terms on the right side. So the simplified equation is: 293*f = 244*f + 490 Step 2: Subtract 244*f from both sides of the equation. 293*f - 244*f = 244*f - 244*f + 490 This simplifies to: 49*f = 490 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 49 to solve for f. (49*f) / 49 = 490 / 49 This simplifies to: f = 10 So, the solution to the given equation -265*f + 558*f = 244*f + 490 is f = 10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: suppose during fishing happens, how will it affect more. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"To restate: After a forest fire, the animals in the forest have fewer places to hide, making it easier for predators to find prey. The question asks how fishing would further affect this second effect. Let's consider each factor involved in this situation: 1. Forest fires burn forests. 2. Animals have fewer places to hide. 3. Predators can find prey easier. 4. Birds fly away from the area. 5. Waters warm up, affecting fish. Fishing generally targets aquatic species, so it will have a direct impact on the number of fish (factor 5). However, the question specifically asks about the influence of fishing on the second effect mentioned (animals having fewer places to hide). The primary impact of fishing would be on aquatic species, which typically do not serve as hiding places for terrestrial animals. Therefore, fishing would have little to no effect on terrestrial animals' ability to find hiding places or on predator-prey dynamics among those animals. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation (fishing) will have no effect on the second effect mentioned (terrestrial animals having fewer places to hide after a forest fire)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Salt Creek Falls is located in the Willamette National Forest, near Oakridge, Oregon. Multnomah Falls is located in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, near Bridal Veil, Oregon. Step 3: Identify possible common areas Now that I know the locations of each waterfall, I will look for any areas they may have in common.

Here's a detailed overview of each victory, highlighting the date, opponent, final score, and MVP of the game: 1. Super Bowl XXI - January 25, 1987: The New York Giants won their first Super Bowl title on January 25, 1987. They played against the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. The Giants emerged victorious with a final score of 39-20. The game's MVP was Phil Simms, the Giants' quarterback, who completed 22 out of 25 passes, resulting in a record-setting 88% completion rate and 268 passing yards. The Giants' defense also proved to be crucial in this win, significantly restricting the Broncos' offensive capabilities. 2. Super Bowl XXV - January 27, 1991: The New York Giants won their second Super Bowl title on January 27, 1991, in a very closely contested match against the Buffalo Bills. The game was played at the Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The Giants won this thrilling encounter with a final score of 20-19. The MVP of the game was Giants' running back, Ottis Anderson, who rushed for 102 yards and scored a touchdown. This game is famously remembered for the dramatic ending when Bills' kicker, Scott Norwood, missed a potentially game-winning field goal in the final seconds, allowing the Giants to walk away with their second Super Bowl title. 3. Super Bowl XLII - February 3, 2008: In one of the biggest upsets in NFL history, the New York Giants secured their third Super Bowl win on February 3, 2008. They played against the heavily favored and previously unbeaten New England Patriots at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Giants won the game with a final score of 17-14. The game's MVP was Giants' quarterback, Eli Manning, who had 255 passing yards and threw two touchdowns, including the iconic game-winning touchdown pass to receiver Plaxico Burress with less than one minute remaining in the game. This win dramatically ended the Patriots' pursuit of a perfect 19-0 season. 4. Super Bowl XLVI - February 5, 2012: The New York Giants won their most recent Super Bowl title on February 5, 2012, in a rematch with the New England Patriots.

In both statements, there are two subjects: one dressed in blue and the other in white. In Statement 1, the person in blue is wearing a vest, and the person in white is wearing a shirt. In Statement 2, the clothing specifics are not mentioned, but it still refers to a person in blue and one in white. Step 3: Compare the actions in both statements. In Statement 1, the person in the blue vest is lunging at the person in a white shirt, suggesting an aggressive, physical action. In Statement 2, the person in blue is going after the person in white, which may indicate a pursuit or an attempt to approach the person. Lunging can be considered a form of \\"going after,\\" as it implies the person in blue is trying to reach or catch the person in white. Step 4: Compare the setting in both statements. In Statement 1, the setting is explicitly mentioned as a \\"sporting field.\\" In Statement 2, the setting is not mentioned. However, it does not contradict the information in Statement 1.

Question: What happened one week before Millicent's society dinner? Movie title: Dinner at Eight Movie plot: One week before her next society dinner, Millicent Jordan (Billie Burke) receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe, whom she and her husband Oliver (Lionel Barrymore), a New York shipping magnate, had met in England the previous year, have accepted her invitation. Overjoyed by this social coup, Millicent is oblivious to Oliver's lack of enthusiasm about the dinner and her daughter Paula's (Madge Evans) preoccupation about the impending return of her fiancÃ©, Ernest DeGraff (Phillips Holmes), from Europe. Millicent fusses about finding an \\"extra man\\" for her single female guest, former stage star Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler), who resides in Europe. Meanwhile, Oliver faces distressing news about his shipping business, which has been struck hard by the Depression. Carlotta, an aging retired actress and former lover of Oliver, visits Oliver at his office and asks him to buy her stock in the company, but he does not have the money. Dan Packard (Wallace Beery), a mining magnate, stops by long enough for Oliver to ask him to buy some company stock. Dan agrees only to consider the proposition, he then brags to his wife Kitty (Jean Harlow) that he will take the shipping business through deceit. Unknown to Dan, Oliver has convinced Millicent to invite the Packards to her dinner with the hopes that it will increase Dan's wish to buy the stock. Dan's young trophy-wife, the ill-mannered but socially ambitious Kitty (Jean Harlow), eagerly has accepted.

Summarize: A Tarot reading is a narrative, a story that you tell to the Seeker. It's an attempt to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances and predict the most likely future. The future you speak of will not be a fixed or definitive outcome; it's important to remember that there are no conclusive endings or absolutes. A \\"spread\\" simply refers to the layout of your cards. A Tarot spread is a configuration or pattern of cards. That pattern provides the framework for a tarot reading. Further, each position of the tarot cards in a spread has a specific meaning. Your reading will use the placement or position of the cards within an identified theme. For example, many spreads include positions for the past, present and future. They can also include positions for internal feelings, specific challenges, external factors and so on. There are hundreds of spreads to try, and more experienced readers can make up their own. Experiment with different spreads, trying especially to choose ones that encourage your imagination and intuition. Figuring out what works best for you is important; many readers come to rely on specific spreads that work best for them. A three-card spread is great for divining answers to uncomplicated questions, for refocusing on simplicity an for beginners who have just started reading. Assign the positions in advance, lay out your spread and use what you've learned about card meanings and combinations to tell a story. Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand a situation are: past/present/future, current situation/obstacle/advice, where you stand now/what you aspire to/how to get there and what will help you/what will hinder you/what is your unrealized potential. Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are: you/the other person/the relationship, opportunities/challenges/outcomes, what brings you together/what pulls you apart/what needs your attention and what you want from the relationship/what you want from the relationship/where the relationship is heading. Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are: mind/body/spirit, material state/emotional state/spiritual state, you/your current path/your potential and stop/start/continue.","completion":"A Tarot reading is a narrative that aims to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances, and predict a most likely future, without fixed outcomes.

Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to \\"a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848\\"), as follows: We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to.

On-loan Murphy then struck twice more inside three minutes before the break. Bradley Dack pulled one back with a left-foot shot on 63 minutes. But it could not stop Gillingham surrendering their lead to City, who climbed to their highest ranking in the Football League since being relegated to the third tier in 2012. Despite controlling the first half hour, City could have fallen behind when Sky Blues old boy Cody McDonald's header was cleared off the line by Jim O'Brien. Instead, the Sky Blues broke down the other end and Murphy took advantage of a mistake by Adedeji Oshilaja to round goalkeeper Stuart Nelson before finishing. Three minutes later, Murphy won the corner that saw Ryan Kent cross for Turner to power home his 37th minute header, marking his first start since his midweek return to the club on loan from Cardiff City.. O'Brien then played in Murphy to round Nelson again before the young on-loan Norwich striker completed his first career treble when he stroked Chris Stokes' cross into the top corner to complete a personal haul of six goals in three games after last weekend's brace at Colchester. Coventry top scorer Adam Armstrong then hit the post before Dack fired home his consolation goal for the visitors. This was the third time this season that 'second' has played 'first' in League One - and, on each occasion, the game has been won by the chasing side, to ensure new leaders of the division. On both previous occasions, in October, Walsall were the winners, beating first Burton Albion and then Gillingham. Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: \\"I'm delighted with a top performance. My job is to inspire the team and get them in the right frame of mind. \\"When they left the dressing room I thought they were ready for a proper game of football, and it proved to be the case. \\"We have to use that as our benchmark and try to attain that performance level as often as we can.\\"","completion":"In a soccer game, Murphy scored three times and helped his team, City, beat Gillingham and reach their highest ranking since 2012."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the quiz \\"what uses sweat to adjust to hot temperatures?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"sweat is used for adjusting to hot temperatures by some animals\\" and \\"all humans are animals\\". So, what's the best answer to the question?","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"what uses sweat to adjust to hot temperatures?\\" is humans. To provide a detailed explanation, let's break down the hints given: 1. Sweat is used for adjusting to hot temperatures by some animals. This hint suggests that among the animal kingdom, there are certain species that rely on sweating as a mechanism for heat regulation. Sweating is a physiological process where the body produces a liquid (sweat) that evaporates on the skin's surface, leading to a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to alleviate the impact of high temperatures on the body, preventing overheating and maintaining an optimal internal temperature for various metabolic processes. 2. All humans are animals. This hint places humans within the category of animals mentioned in the previous hint. It is a reminder of the biological classification of humans and implies that humans might also be among those animals that use sweating for heat regulation. According to these hints, we can infer that the quiz question is asking about an animal species that uses sweating as a mechanism for adapting to hot temperatures. As humans fall under the category of animals, and it is common knowledge that humans use sweating to regulate their body temperature in hot environments, we can confidently deduce that the best answer to the question is \\"humans.\\" It is worth noting that other animals, such as horses and some primates, also utilize the process of sweating to cool their bodies in hot temperatures. However, in the context of the given hints and quiz question, humans remain the most fitting answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If The Prodigal Son is an old story., can we conclude that \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the conclusion \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything\\" is valid, let's examine the statements provided and perform a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Understand the story of The Prodigal Son. The Prodigal Son is a parable from the Christian Bible, specifically found in the Gospel of Luke. It tells the story of a father with two sons, where the younger son leaves his family, squanders his inheritance, and later returns to seek forgiveness and redemption. The story conveys moral and religious lessons about repentance, forgiveness, and the unconditional love of a father (or God). Step 2: Examine the premise - \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story.\\" This statement is true. As part of the Christian Bible, the story is approximately 2,000 years old, and has been told and retold by countless people over time. Step 3: Analyze the conclusion - \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything.\\" The phrase \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is an idiomatic expression, made famous by British author, Douglas Adams' book \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" This phrase is used to encompass broad and complex concepts and not meant to be taken literally in most contexts. In this context, the conclusion tries to claim that the story of The Prodigal Son can be generalized to a grand, all-encompassing level about life and existence itself. Step 4: Compare the premise and the conclusion. While the story of The Prodigal Son does provide valuable insights and moral lessons about life, it does not encompass the entirety of life, the universe, and everything. It is a specific story with specific lessons, rather than a universal explanation for all aspects of existence. Conclusion: We cannot conclude that \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything.\\" The story does have some significant life lessons, but connecting it to the broader phrase of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is an exaggeration and generalization that goes beyond the scope of the story."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \\"shocking\\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \\"performance\\" by the lawyers. \\"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\\" Wu said. \\"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \\"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\\", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. \\"It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal.

Bars with loud music and huge crowds are unlikely to win a cancer woman's favor. Some think Cancer women love traveling. A good way to plan a date is planning short trips. Take her away for the weekend on occasion to somewhere she has never been before. A Cancer woman will appreciate this gesture. You do not need to spend a fortune on a trip. A day trip to a nearby city can be a great way to spend a Saturday with a Cancer woman. Remember that Cancer women prefer intimate settings. When planning activities for a day trip, look for locations that are quiet and low-key over loud bars and crowded restaurants. Some think Cancer women prefer it if their partner makes the first move. They are unlikely to initiate physical contact or the first kiss. If a cancer woman seems engaged with you, try brushing her hand, touching her arm, or leaning in for a kiss. If you're planning something like a birthday party for a Cancer woman, smaller is generally better. Cancer women have a few close relationships and prefer to spend time with small groups of people. Gather a Cancer woman's close friends for events rather than inviting, say, everyone from her office or casual acquaintances from school. You can, for example, have a birthday party for your Cancer woman in your home. Invite a few of her closest friends and plan low-key activities like board games. If you take a Cancer woman out for her birthday, invite only a handful of friends and choose a quiet location. Those who believe in astrology find Cancer women appreciate sincerity in a partner more than their career, material possessions, or education. Romantic gestures should come from a place of sincerity. Rather than trying to impress her with an expensive date night, go for something personal for her. For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met.","completion":"Some people think Cancer women like quiet and cozy places more than loud and crowded ones. So, for a date, choose a small restaurant or a calm coffee shop instead of a noisy bar. They also like going on little trips to new places. If you want to kiss or touch her, you should make the first move because she might be shy. For her birthday, plan a small party with just her closest friends, not a big group. To make her happy, be sincere and do something special from your heart instead of spending lots of money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait.

Bismark Mensah, who came to America several months ago, was collecting carts outside a Walmart in Federal Way. It was a part-time job for him. He earned 9.05 an hour in charge of getting carts out of the parking lot. He was used to finding stuff in carts that customers had somehow forgotten -- keys, credit cards, wallets. And he turned them into a customer service. But a particular item stood out. It was a white envelope with a clear window in the middle, and there was a lot of cash in it, around 20,000. Mensah turned them into customer services. Because of what he did that afternoon, Mensah is now the winner of Walmart's national 2013 \\"Integrity in Action Award\\". Bismark Mensah says that since the story ran, he has become the model the youth in Ghana (his native country). He is now employed full-time at the Federal Way Walmart, earning 10.95 an hour, up from the 9.05 an hour he earned working part-time. Mensah, 33, no longer collects carts and such.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"What types of cases were prohibited by PL 104-134?\\" Response: \\"Defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

News article: BOSTON (CN) – Showcasing the diversity of Howard Stern’s appeal, a woman suing the IRS says an agent who had been calling into the show inadvertently gave the shock jock and his listeners an earful of their conversation on a private tax matter. Judith Barrigas of Sandwich, Massachusetts, filed the federal complaint Monday in Boston, nearly two years after her debut on satellite radio left her in a state of humiliation and anxiety. She says it all started on May 19, 2015, when she called the IRS to discuss a private tax matter. During that 45-minute call with agent Jimmy Forsyth, Barrigas allegedly began receiving numerous text messages from unknown people because her call was being broadcast live on “The Howard Stern Show.” In addition to her phone number, which Stern fans promptly began dialing up, Barrigas says other personal information she shared during the course of the call included her tax-return and -refund issues, and the details of a repayment plan for certain tax liabilities. Stern’s program draws approximately 1.2 million listeners to SiriusXM every day. The shock jock apparently got access to the call because the agent with whom Barrigas was speaking, Jimmy Forsythe, was on hold with Stern when he took the Barrigas call on another line. “Mr. Stern and The Stern Show joked about the publication and broadcast of Mrs. Barrigas’s tax and personal information and conversation with the IRS’s Agent Forsythe and used the broadcast and the humiliation of Mrs. Barrigas as a source of amusement for their listeners,” the complaint states. Barrigas says hundreds of thousands of people have heard her call already thanks to Stern, and that she received hundreds of phone calls about it in the days afterward, “leaving Mrs, Barrigas in a frantic, high anxiety state.” Despite her efforts to close this Pandora’s box, according to the complaint, Stern left the episode up for weeks on his website. By now the call is all over the internet. Barrigas says the IRS was apparently planning to ignore her complaint altogether until she not reported the incident to the consumer helpline run by local news outlet WCVB-TV. “Only upon notice from WCVB did the IRS begin an investigation into the matter and place Agent Forsythe on administrative leave,” the complaint states. Representatives for the IRS and Stern have not returned requests seeking comment. Barrigas is represented by Sol Cohen of Cohen & Sales in Waltham. She seeks punitive damages, alleging invasion of privacy, emotional distress and other claims. Like this: Like Loading... ||||| An IRS agent called in to the radio show and was put on hold. Then … Donald Trump never did sue The New York Times for revealing he took a 916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns. He threatened, but to date, no lawsuit has come. That leaves some unanswered questions about the legality of a media outlet disclosing one's tax information, since there are many statutes that broadly guard the confidentiality of tax returns. Can Howard Stern fill the void? On Monday, Stern was sued by a woman named Judith Barrigas, whose tax information was disseminated in the oddest way. According to her complaint filed in Massachusetts federal court, she called the IRS's service center on May 19, 2015, to discuss how the tax agency had applied prior year liabilities to her tax refund. She got connected to Jimmy Forsythe, an IRS agent. Before the two connected, Forsythe had called in to The Howard Stern Show using another phone line. While on hold, Forsythe took Barrigas' call and proceeded to spend 45 minutes with her discussing her tax case. Apparently, during this conversation, someone at Stern's show heard what was happening and decided to air the discussion live on satellite radio. \\"While on the phone with Agent Forsythe, Mrs. Barrigas suddenly began to receive a barrage of text messages and phone calls from unknown callers/individuals,\\" states the complaint. \\"The text messages were informing Mrs. Barrigas that her personal information and phone number was being aired live on The Stern Show.\\" The lawsuit says that the phone call in question can still be accessed on the internet, and after what happened, Forsythe was put on administrative leave. Barrigas claims the \\"outrageous violation\\" of her privacy has resulted in difficulty finding employment, anxiety, loss of sleep and irregular eating patterns. She is suing the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act and for an unlawful disclosure of her tax return. But she's also asserting negligence and an invasion of her privacy against Stern and his show. \\"The defendants breached their duty of reasonable care by broadcasting the private phone conversation between Mrs. Barrigas and the IRS on May 19, 2015, and thereby publicly disseminating private tax return and identity information of Mrs. Barrigas’s to over one million people worldwide,\\" states the lawsuit demanding compensatory and punitive damages. In Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Supreme Court protected a radio broadcaster who disclosed the contents of an illegally intercepted communication. That case turned on a media outlet's lawful obtainment of tapes and the First Amendment. Here, the IRS agent called in, but arguably there wasn't much that was newsworthy about Barrigas' tax situation. Plus, it all happened live. Now Stern and the government under Trump are co-defendants in a suit over tax disclosures. THR will provide updates on this case as it develops. In the meantime, here's the full complaint. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A woman is suing radio host Howard Stern and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) after her tax information was broadcast on Stern's show.

Let me provide you with a detailed answer to that question: Certifications can undoubtedly help in career growth for several reasons: 1. Skill Enhancement: Certifications demonstrate that you have acquired specific skills in your field, which can be a deciding factor during hiring or promotion processes. Employers value individuals who pursue continuous learning and professional development. 2. Competitive Edge: A certification can set you apart from your peers in the job market. In a competitive job market, certifications show that you are committed to staying up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in your field. 3. Networking: Pursuing certifications through professional organizations often opens up networking opportunities with fellow professionals. These connections can aid in your career growth as you can learn from the experience and knowledge of others. 4. Increased Earning Potential: Many certifications are linked to higher salary levels as they are considered a mark of your expertise and skills. Employers may be more willing to offer competitive salaries to certified professionals. 5. Employer Recognition: Some organizations actively seek out certified professionals and may even include this requirement in their job descriptions. Holding a certification can help you secure job opportunities with such organizations. 6. Job Security: Certifications can contribute to job security because they show your dedication and motivation to be the best at your job. This dedication can make you an asset to your employer, which in turn, can make them less likely to let you go. 7. Personal Growth: Apart from benefiting your career, certifications can also help you grow personally. Acquiring new skills or expanding your existing skill set may boost your confidence, self-esteem, and sense of achievement. However, it's important to note that simply obtaining a certification does not guarantee career growth. To maximize the potential benefits of a certification, it is crucial to: - Choose the right certification program, one that aligns with your career goals and is recognized in your industry. - Continue learning and staying up-to-date with industry developments even after obtaining your certification. - Effectively market your certification on your resume, LinkedIn profile, and during interviews to showcase the value you bring to prospective employers. In conclusion, certifications can help in career growth as they can provide multiple benefits, such as enhancing your skillset, giving you a competitive edge, and increasing your earning potential. However, one should also remember that career growth does not solely rely on certifications, and factors such as experience, networking, and personal attributes also play crucial roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the days leading up to nursery school, talk to your child about what will happen at school. You can tell your child where they'll be going, what they'll be doing during the day, and what will be expected of them. Try to keep it as light and fun-sounding as possible, but let your child express their fears. Try to answer any questions they have honestly and openly. For example, you could say things like, \\"In a few weeks, you'll be going to nursery school. Nursery school is when you go to a place where there are other kids. You'll get to play and listen to stories. Mommy and Daddy won't be there, but you'll have another adult called a teacher looking after you, like when you go to daycare. Does that sound like fun?\\" If the first time your kid has ever been away from you or other family members is nursery school, it can make the process that much scarier. To help take some of the sting away, practice the separation by asking a friend to babysit for you. Start with shorter periods away, such as 30 minutes, and work up to longer periods. Tell your child you're going to leave, but that you'll be back soon. When you come back, you're proving to your child that you'll do what you say. If your child doesn't stop crying the whole time you're gone after several sessions, they may not be ready to go to nursery school yet. Most schools have open houses where you and your child can see the school. Seeing the school ahead of time helps you prepare your child for going there. Plus, letting your child see the classroom can get them excited about going to school, as it will probably be bright and colorful with toys and books. Another way to help ease your child into nursery school is to have your child meet the teacher. That way, your child will be able to see how nice the teacher is, and they'll have a friendly, familiar face on the first day of school. While school is in session, trying take your kid by the school so he or she can see the other kids playing. Seeing the fun they're having will help your child be more comfortable with the idea of going to school. Whenever you're talking about school, talk about how fun and exciting it will be. If your child sees you're enthusiastic, they'll be enthusiastic, too. Keep the enthusiasm up even when you're taking your kid to school for the first time. If you're upset and anxious, it will rub off on your child, while if you stay excited, it will likely be easier on them the first time. Another way to encourage enthusiasm is to let your kid pick out school supplies in anticipation of school. Obviously, the school will have some required supplies, but letting your kid pick out their lunchbox, backpack, and even new school clothes can make them more excited. Another way to give your child choices is to let them pick out things for school in the morning. For instance, you can let them choose their outfit, as well as their snack or lunch.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Awnings do require regular cleaning, but mildew demands a different kind of cleaning solution and more elbow grease. Mildew is a type of fungus that’s similar to mold. On an awning, it will likely appear as gray or white spots, and will look like a powder. You can simply use a regular cleaner if your awning doesn’t have mildew. To get the best results from your cleaning efforts, start by hosing down the awing so it’s completely wet. This will make the cleaning solution easier to spread, and the mildew easier to remove. To remove mildew from a canvas awning, you'll need a cleaning solution made with 1 cup (237 ml) bleach, ¼ cup (59 ml) of mild liquid soap, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool water. If you need more cleaning solution, simply double or triple all the quantities. Mild liquid soaps include laundry soaps that are designed for sensitive skin, babies, or delicate fabrics. Do not use chlorine bleach on canvas, as this can damage the fabric. For colored awnings, use a color safe bleach. It’s also a good idea to test a patch of the cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color fastness. Place some cleaning solution on a small patch of the top side of the awning and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing and checking for discoloration. Dip the clean cloth into the cleaning solution and spread the cleaner all over the awning. Re-dip the cloth as necessary so that cleaning solution reaches every inch of the fabric, otherwise you might miss some of the mildew. Once the entire surface of the awning has been soaked with cleaner, let it sit for about 15 minutes. This will give the cleaner time to soak into the fabric and kill the mildew. When the cleaning solution has had time to soak in, take the soft-bristled brush and scrub the top side of the fabric. Use a vigorous circular motion to generate suds. Go over every inch of the awning to scrub away all the mildew. If the cleaning solution starts to dry anywhere, re-soak the area before you scrub. After scrubbing mildew from the whole awning, rinse it well with clean water from the hose. Continue rinsing until all the soap and dirt have been washed off. You don’t want to leave any bleach residue on the fabric, or it could cause early deterioration. If there's any mildew left on the awning, repeat the soaking and scrubbing steps until it’s gone. Most awnings are designed to dry quickly after the rain, so it won’t take your awning long to air dry. If you cleaned your awning in place, simply let it dry on the frame. If you removed your awning, hang it to dry on a line before reinstalling it. Never dry canvas awnings in a dryer, as they may shrink. When you bought your awning, it would have been treated with a water- and stain-resistant coating to protect it from water and discoloration. But scrubbing it with bleach will have removed this coating, so you'll need to reapply it. Look for a commercial-grade fabric guard that can be sprayed on. Once the awning is dry, spray the fabric guard onto the top side of the awning. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions. Some awning warranties will be voided if you use silicone sprays, so make sure you check the conditions of your warranty. For smaller awnings that you removed to clean, return the awning to its frame once it’s dry and after the water-resistant treatment has had time to dry.","completion":"This article is about how to clean and treat awning fabric to remove mildew and maintain its water-resistance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To ensure the success of their venture and to secure patent rights, Bell asked his associate George Brown in Ontario to apply for a patent in Britain. Their approach was strategic, as Bell's lawyers were instructed to file a patent application in the United States only after they had received confirmation from Britain. This was because, at the time, Britain would only issue patents for inventions that had not been patented in any other country. By promising to split the U.S. profits with his financiers Hubbard and Sanders, Bell effectively formed a partnership with them in order to carry out the development and eventual commercialization of the acoustic telegraph.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Angela is currently cleaning a car upholstery for Megan, because Options: + Angela could really use some help.; + Megan could really use some help.;","completion":"Megan could really use some help. Megan had been swamped with work lately, and her once lovely car had fallen victim to the chaos of her daily life. With her job becoming increasingly demanding, grabbing a quick snack on the way to and from her responsibilities became the norm. Coffee cups and fast food bags littered the car's floors, and even the once-pristine upholstery was showing its age under layers of dirt, grime, and spills. That's where Angela came in. Angela was Megan's best friend, and she couldn't stand seeing Megan so overwhelmed. One day, as Megan groaned about her car's state and the lack of time she had to clean it, Angela decided to step in. She went out of her way to gather all the necessary cleaning supplies and even bought a brand-new upholstery cleaner, determined to get Megan's car back to its former glory. On a sunny Saturday morning, Angela arrived at Megan's house, upholstery cleaner in hand, ready to tackle the mess. Megan protested, insisting she couldn't let Angela do this all by herself, but Angela simply smiled and assured her it was an act of friendship. They started by removing all the trash from the car, filling several bags with discarded food wrappers, coffee cups, water bottles, and various other items. Once the trash was cleared out, Angela surveyed the remaining work, her expression never faltering. She began by vacuuming up the loose dirt and dust from the car's interior, ensuring every crevice was reached. They then moved on to the upholstery, an area where the layers of grime had thoroughly set in. Angela readied the upholstery cleaner, confident that it would make a difference. They started by applying the cleaning solution, leaving it to set for a few minutes as they worked on stubborn stains, scrubbing and lifting the ground-in dirt. Angela knew a little elbow grease was needed to really get things looking clean. As they scrubbed, the once-bright fabric began to reemerge, revealing patterns and colors long since hidden under the grime. The next step was to use a damp cloth to wipe away the cleaning solution, making sure not to leave behind any soapy residue. As the car's upholstery began to dry, they could truly see the transformation. The vibrant colors had returned, and the once-absent patterns were now clear and crisp. As they looked over their handiwork, Megan couldn't help but get emotional. Tears filled her eyes as she thanked Angela for her incredible kindness. Angela, never one to make a big deal out of acts of generosity, simply wrapped her friend into a hug, insisting that it was nothing compared to the years of support they'd always shared. However, their work wasn't done just yet. To make sure the upholstery truly looked its best, they applied a fabric protectant to guard against future stains and damage. Angela joked that this would be Megan's \\"clean slate,\\" a chance to start fresh and keep her car a clean, welcoming space - a sanctuary from her hectic life outside its doors. As the day came to a close and Megan's car sparkled from the efforts of their labors, they stood back to admire their accomplishments.

Article: Color is very important in our daily life. It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s. In Thailand, for example, only kings, queens and members of the royal family could wear purple while in ancient China, yellow was the color1 reserved for the emperor and the empress. Nowadays, people can wear whatever color1 they like or as they think appropriate. Question: Brides wear white because it is a color1 for _ .

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,... Question: Why is there most likely support for Pres. Trump's tariffs? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","completion":"There is most likely support for President Trump's tariffs because some Senate Democrats, labor unions, and voters in certain states are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs due to foreign competition. These supporters believe that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum could help protect domestic industries and jobs by making it more expensive for foreign competitors to sell their products in the U.S. market. This would, in turn, create a more level playing field for American manufacturers and could potentially lead to job growth in the steel and aluminum sectors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: + Hard to understand; + very in a hurry; + that she was lazy; The answer is:","completion":"After completing her assignment due tomorrow in a hurried manner, Riley is likely to experience a mix of emotions. The initial emotion she will most likely feel is relief, as she submitted her assignment before the deadline and can therefore avoid any potential penalties that might have resulted from missing the due date. However, because she had to rush through her assignment, Riley may also feel stressed and anxious about the quality and accuracy of her work. She may worry that the hurried pace of her efforts compromised her ability to think critically, articulate her ideas, and address all aspects of the assignment. This could potentially lead to her feeling less confident in her submission, as she may be aware that she did not have adequate time to polish and refine it. Furthermore, there's a possibility that Riley could feel a sense of guilt for procrastinating on her assignment. She might wonder if the outcome could have been better had she managed her time more efficiently, rather than waiting until the last minute. Realizing that her lack of proper time management has put her in a precarious situation may cause Riley to feel that she was acting lazy. Ultimately, this may lead to feelings of self-doubt about her work ethic and academic capabilities. In addition to these emotions, it's also possible that Riley could feel a sense of urgency to implement changes or improvements to her time management and study habits. She may recognize that by being more disciplined in her approach to assignments, she can avoid the stress and anxiety of last-minute work and potentially achieve stronger results in the future. In conclusion, Riley's emotions after completing her rushed assignment would likely be multifaceted and complex, with a sense of relief and accomplishment mingling with stress, anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. She might also experience an inner drive to grow and improve her study habits in order to prevent such occurrences from happening again in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"another serb army general wanted for war crimes to surrender to the hague his lawyer says\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Serb Army General, Accused of War Crimes, to Surrender to The Hague, According to His Lawyer In a recent development in the ongoing quest for justice in the Balkan region, another former Serb Army General, accused of war crimes, is set to surrender himself to The Hague, as per the statements made by his lawyer. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has long sought the extradition of numerous individuals alleged to have been involved in human rights atrocities, war crimes, and genocide during the brutal conflicts that took place in the 1990s. The Serb Army General, whose name has not been disclosed due to legal matters, has been under indictment for his purported role in orchestrating and perpetrating numerous war crimes - including ethnic cleansing, forced deportations, and mass murders - against the Croat, Bosniak, and Albanian populations. His lawyer has maintained that the General is innocent and that his actions were taken strictly within the scope of his military duties. However, the General has now voluntarily decided to face The Hague tribunal to clear his name and uphold the dignity of the Serb Army. The conflicts in the Balkans, most notably in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo, left a long-lasting impact on the region and the world at large. The international community bore witness to brazen acts of ethnic cleansing, where entire villages and communities were obliterated. The scale of atrocities committed during these conflicts shocked the conscience of the world and left an indelible stain on humanity’s collective memory. It is estimated that over 100,000 people lost their lives during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. The ICTY was established in 1993 by the United Nations in response to these heinous acts to prosecute individuals responsible for war crimes committed during the conflicts in the Balkans. To date, the ICTY has indicted over 161 people, with many prominent political and military figures standing trial for their part in the atrocities, including former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadžić. The ongoing pursuit of justice has not waned, and the stories of the victims continue to drive the necessity for accountability. The surrender of this Serb Army General signifies the commitment of the international community to pursuing justice relentlessly and ensuring that those accused of war crimes face legal consequences. The ICTY and its judicial processes have played a pivotal role in delivering justice to the victims and their families, fostering reconciliation, and setting a precedence for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other similar initiatives worldwide. As the General prepares to surrender to the Tribunal, he and his legal team are expected to mount a vigorous defense. The ICTY will be tasked with the responsibility of diligently examining the evidence, evaluating the testimony of witnesses, and ensuring a fair and impartial trial. While the pursuit of justice is essential, it is equally critical to maintain the principles of due process and the rule of law in order to preserve the credibility of the Tribunal and give a fair chance to the accused to clear their name. This latest development represents not only a positive sign of progress in international justice but also reiterates the unwavering determination of the global community in pursuing accountability for war crimes, no matter how long ago they occurred. The healing process may be long, and the wounds deep, but the pursuit of justice and the staunch refusal to forget the atrocities of the past serve as reminders that the international community will not allow such acts to go unpunished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A simple piece of clothesline hangs between some environmentally friendly Americans and their neighbors. On one side stand those who see clothes dryers as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: One of the reasons why supporters of clothes dryers are trying to ban clothesline drying is that _ .

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music. - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927 June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961. - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928 April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971. - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally. - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the \\"Poet Laureate of Jazz\\", while \\"Time\\" dubbed him the \\"James Joyce of Jive\\". Al Jarreau has called him \\"pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planetmaybe that's ever been\\". - The Composer of Desafinado , Plays is the debut album by Antônio Carlos Jobim , released in 1963 . The album was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 . What is the relationship between 'the composer of desafinado plays' and 'bossa nova'?

The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product.

Please answer the following question: Q: What substances affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts? Choices: - H2 blockers - primeval drugs or drugs - amphetamines - psychoactive drugs or drugs A: Answer:","completion":"A: Psychoactive drugs or drugs Psychoactive substances, also known as psychoactive drugs, are compounds that can affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. These substances can alter specific neural processes, brain activities, or brain functions, which in turn impact individuals' mood, consciousness, perception, cognition, and behavior. There are several categories of psychoactive drugs: 1. Stimulants: These drugs, such as amphetamines, cocaine, and caffeine, are known to increase alertness, energy, and attention by acting on the central nervous system (CNS). They work by enhancing the release or blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin, which are associated with elevated mood and increased activity. 2. Depressants: These substances, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, act on the CNS to slow down brain activity and promote relaxation and sedation. They work by increasing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby resulting in reduced anxiety, drowsiness, and muscle relaxation. 3. Hallucinogens: These drugs, including LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, alter perception, emotions, and thought processes, often by disrupting the release or reuptake of serotonin. They can induce hallucinations, distorted perceptions, and intense emotional reactions. 4. Opioids: Opioid drugs, such as morphine, heroin, and fentanyl, work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, mimicking the effects of endorphins, which are naturally produced pain-relieving substances. Opioids can cause analgesia, euphoria, and sedation but are also associated with a high potential for addiction and overdose. 5. Cannabinoids: These compounds, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) found in cannabis, act on the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. These drugs can cause relaxation, altered perception, and increased appetite but may also impair memory, coordination, and reaction time. In summary, psychoactive drugs are substances that can impact the brain and alter a person's mood, perception, and cognition. Some of these drugs include stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, opioids, and cannabinoids, each having distinct mechanisms of action on the brain's neural processes, thereby influencing how an individual feels, thinks, or acts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If your boyfriend gives you a hard time about answering a text in front him, say something like, \\"We talked about this.

In cases of emotional abuse especially, it's important to get away from the situation. If you've concluded the relationship is emotionally abusive, end it. It's very important you not subject yourself to more bad treatment, and it's unlikely an abusive partner will ever change. Periods of normal behavior, in which your partner compromises and treats you well, are cyclical. Eventually, the abuse will occur again and periods of normalcy tend to get shorter as time goes by. If you end an obsessive or abusive relationship, it's normal to suffer feelings of low self worth in the aftermath. A good way to counteract such negative thoughts is through seeking out people who value you as a person. Seek the support of friends and family members who care about you and want to see you successful and happy. Find your most supportive friends. Connect with people who are positive and care about who you are. Have people you can share your passions with. If you're a writer, for example, host a small workshop with your friends where you share one another's work. It's important, in the aftermath of an obsessive relationship, to be around people who support you and want you to succeed. Whether or not you choose to stay with your boyfriend, it's important you seek the help of a therapist. Individual counseling or couple's counseling can help you sort through relationship issues and learn coping techniques. You can find a therapist through your insurance or you can get a referral from your existing doctor. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

Here's a detailed explanation: The scene is a field where people are training in the sport of hurling. Hurling is an outdoor team sport of ancient Gaelic and Irish origin. It involves two teams trying to score points by hitting a small ball called a sliotar with a wooden stick known as a hurley. Given the context, it is only logical to expect players to practice their fundamental skills in the sport. Option a) suggests that the people will engage in an unspecified round of throwing rather than participating in a hurling practice session. The concept of \\"other an throw the balls\\" does not make clear sense. Moreover, it does not accurately represent the sport of hurling. Option c) describes participants taking up archery and throwing it behind other people. This event does not align with the practice of hurling. Archery is a completely different sport that involves shooting arrows with a bow, and it does not correlate with the setup presented in the question. Option d) suggests that people throw strikes while running and throwing the ball. This option, although seemingly related to hurling, is not an accurate representation of the sport. Hurling does not involve throwing strikes per se, and the usage of such a term creates confusion around the practice activity. In contrast, option b) lines up with the scenario provided and describes an activity consistent with hurling practice. Throwing and catching the sliotar (ball) are essential skills for hurling; thus, players would logically throw a ball to other players in the field as part of their training session. This activity would help improve players' accuracy, timing, and coordination, preparing them for actual game situations. In conclusion, given the context of people training in hurling on a field, the most logical next event is option b), where players throw a ball to other players in the field to practice and enhance their fundamental skills in the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice? MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment.

The reviewer begins by comparing \\"hill,\\" presumably the movie's director or a leading figure in the movie, to reputable filmmakers Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich. By implying that Hill isn't quite at the level of these iconic directors, the reviewer subtly undermines his abilities or the movie's worth. While it may not be a direct or harsh criticism, the comparison insinuates that the movie being reviewed isn't as well-crafted as it could be if it was made by Don Siegel or Robert Aldrich. Next, the review mentions there being \\"no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair.\\" Presumably, this phrase is referring to a lack of emotional depth in the film. The use of the term \\"chest hair\\" appears to be a metaphor for machismo or bravado, which may be some of the surface-level qualities found in the movie. By saying that there is nothing beneath the chest hair, the reviewer critiques the movie for not having anything deeper, more profound, or emotionally resonant for the audience. In conclusion, while the review is not explicitly negative, its opinion of the movie can be inferred as negative based on the unfavorable comparison to other directors and the criticism of a lack of emotional depth. The reviewer's phrasing may be indirect, but the overall impression given is that the movie is not as great as it could be, and thus it leans more towards a negative opinion."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However, upon watching the movie, it became evident that the actual experience fell significantly short of my expectations. The story of \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" revolves around the journey of a young and ambitious artist struggling to find fame and acceptance in a ruthless and unforgiving world. On paper, this narrative appears to hold the potential for an emotionally charged and thought-provoking exploration of human desires and the nature of success. Regrettably, the screenplay and direction fail to deliver the meaningfulness and depth that the concept deserves, instead opting for heavy-handed melodrama and clichéd dialogues. In doing so, it reduces the film's potential for thoughtful exploration of the character's psyche and sense of self-worth. The lackluster cast further exacerbates the film's woes. Lamentably, the lead actor's performance is disappointingly one-dimensional, which ultimately fails to inspire any emotional connection with the character. The supporting cast, while competent in their roles, is unable to overcome the film's weak writing and direction. Consequently, the movie's pacing suffers, as it drags out scenes that should feel tense and revelatory. Additionally, the cinematography of \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" is far from inspired. The color palette is drab, and the visual compositions lack artistic flair. Similarly, the score is forgettable at best, barely managing to leave a semblance of a lasting impression. However, it is worth disclosing that \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" does offer fleeting glimpses of promise. At times, the story touches upon pertinent themes, like the costs of ambition and the fleeting nature of achievement. In these moments, the film almost succeeds in resonating emotionally. Sadly, these instances are far and few between and are quickly overshadowed by the many weaknesses that envelop the production. In summary, \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" is a classic case of a film with captivating potential that fails to deliver due to its numerous setbacks – a weak screenplay, lackluster performances, and unremarkable cinematography. As a movie that many hoped to be an emotional and thought-provoking exploration of ambition, it is a regretful outcome. Ultimately, the film leaves us with a profound sense of disillusionment, albeit not the kind its creators intended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations. The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray.

Summarize the following: Don't house the hedgehog under your stereo player or television. As a prey animal in the wild that depends largely on its sense of hearing, your hedgehog will find too much noise and activity very distressing. Ensure that noise, lighting and activity levels are low in its vicinity and move the cage if the noise levels increase for any reason. Hedgehogs can get used to noise if introduced gradually. Hedgehogs are prone to putting on weight, so exercise is a must for them. This means plenty of toys, along with its hedgehog wheel. Toys should be something they can chew, push, nuzzle and even tip over, as long as they cannot chew pieces off or swallow. Be sure their nails or feet can't get caught in any loose strings or small holes. Possible toys include: rubber balls, old kids' toys, rubber figures, baby teething rings, empty toilet paper tubes cut in half lengthwise, cat balls or bird toys with bells inside, etc. Let your hedgehog play in a larger playpen occasionally. You can purchase a large plastic tub or let it explore your bath (without water, of course). Hedgehogs are notoriously good at hiding ailments, so it is extremely necessary to be aware of your hedgehog. Keep track of any changes and call your vet to see if there's something that needs to be checked out. If your hedgehog doesn't eat for one or two days, something is wrong and it needs veterinary attention. Hedgehogs that go for a few days without food are at risk of developing fatty liver disease, a life-threatening condition. Watch out for scaly, dry skin around the quills: this could be a sign of mites, which can be debilitating if left unchecked. Wheezing or crackly respiration as well as discharge on the face or wrists are signs of respiratory infection, a common and serious condition in hedgehogs. Soft stools for more than a day, or diarrhea combined with listlessness or lack of appetite can be signs of a parasite infection or other illness. Hibernation, though occurring in the wild, is not safe for hedgehogs living in captivity. As mentioned above, if your hedgie feels cool on the belly, try to warm him by putting him under your shirt next to your skin. If he does not warm within an hour, bring him immediately to the veterinarian's. A hedgehog's familiarity with being held comes with being handled frequently. Always be confident when handling a hedgehog: they are not as fragile as they seem. The general rule is at least 30 minutes a day of handling. Approach your hedgie quietly and slowly. Pick it up by lifting it from underneath, then hold it cupped in both hands. Make time for play. As well as handling your hedgehog, don't be afraid to join in with play. Your hedgehog will accept your involvement in play if you join in regularly. Clean the dishes and water bottle/bowl daily with hot water. Clean the wheel and spot-clean daily, changing bedding weekly or as needed. Some hedgies are cleaner than others, so you may need to bathe it more or less frequently. Fill a sink with warm (not hot) water to the level of the hog's belly. Water should not get in their ears or nose. Add a mild oatmeal bath (such as Aveeno) or puppy bath to the water, and use a toothbrush to brush out their quills and feet. Rinse with warm water and snuggle in a clean, dry towel until your friend is dry. If she'll tolerate it, use a hair dryer on low - otherwise, stick with the towel. Never put a wet hedgie back in its cage. If they get too long and curl around, they can get ripped off while running on their wheel. Clip your hog's nails with small manicure scissors, trimming off only the very tips. If bleeding occurs, dab a little cornstarch on the spot with a Q-tip. Don't use commercially available powders, which are apt to sting. Quilling is the hedgehog equivalent of our losing baby teeth or a snake shedding its skin. This begins to happen at six to eight weeks of age and can happen throughout their first year of life as the baby quills make way for adult quills. This is a normal process and not something to worry about unless there are signs of illness or discomfort present, or the quills are failing to grow back. Your hedgehog may be irritable during this process and less amenable to being held; you can try an oatmeal bath to ease their discomfort. It is only a phase.","completion":"The text provides comprehensive information about taking care of a hedgehog. It's crucial to provide a calm, quiet environment, arrange for plenty of exercise with the right type of toys, and permit some free roam outside the cage now and then. Hedgehogs can hide illnesses, so vigilance is key. Signs of illness include changes in eating habits, dry or scaly skin, and respiratory issues. They are prone to several health conditions, like fatty liver disease or mite infestations, and need immediate veterinary attention when sick. Regular handling trains them to be comfortable with human contact. Hygiene needs include daily dish cleaning, weekly bedding changes, periodic baths, and nail trimming. Quilling, the process of shedding baby quills for adult ones, can happen during the first year and may cause temporary irritability. A proper caring routine, including play and handling, will make hedgehogs comfortable around their human caretakers. It's important to remember that a hedgehog's natural habitat should be respected by limiting areas with high noise or bright lighting, such as near televisions or stereo players."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will need to put oil in the bottom of your frying pan and heat it up over medium-high heat until the oil starts slightly smoking..","completion":"The goal is to determine the best time to add an egg to the pan for frying. To accomplish this goal, I would recommend going with option i. You will need to put oil in the bottom of your frying pan and heat it up over medium-low heat until the oil shimmers. Here's a detailed explanation: Option i. (The Recommended method) 1. Choose the right pan: To fry an egg properly, use a non-stick or a well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan. The pan should have a flat bottom and low, slightly sloping sides. 2. Add the oil: Pour enough oil or fat (such as butter) to cover the bottom of the pan lightly. You can use vegetable oil, olive oil, or whatever oil you prefer. The oil helps prevent the egg from sticking and ensures even cooking. 3. Heat the oil: Put the pan on the stove and set it to medium-low heat. Wait for the oil to heat up slowly, which may take a few minutes. You want the heat to be just right, as too high heat can cause the egg to crisp up too quickly, while low heat might cause it to stick. 4. Check the oil temperature: When the oil starts to shimmer, it's ready for the egg. You can also check by dipping the tip of a wooden spoon or a chopstick into the oil; if it produces small bubbles around the wood, it's ready. 5. Crack the egg: Crack a fresh egg into a small bowl or ramekin. Removing any particles of shell and ensuring that both the yolk and white are intact. 6. Add the egg to the pan: Gently slide the egg from the bowl into the pan. You will hear a sizzle as the egg hits the pan, and the white will start to cook and turn opaque. 7. Cook the egg: Allow the egg to cook undisturbed for a few minutes until the whites are set and no longer translucent. You can also put a lid on the pan for about 1-2 minutes to help cook the top part of the egg. 8. Optional: If you prefer an over-easy or over-medium egg, gently flip the egg over using a spatula and cook it for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on your desired doneness for the yolk. 9. Remove the egg: Once the egg is cooked to your liking, use a spatula to gently slide under the egg and lift it from the pan, placing it onto a plate. 10. Season and serve: Season the fried egg with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately. Option ii. (Not recommended) Heating oil over medium-high heat until it slightly starts smoking is not advisable for frying eggs. At this temperature, the oil is too hot and would result in uneven cooking, with the edges burning and the egg white becoming tough. Such high heat would also make it challenging to control the cooking process, causing the egg yolk to cook too much or even break while flipping it. In conclusion, adding the egg to the pan when the oil shimmers over medium-low heat (Option i) is a more suitable method for frying eggs. This method provides optimal control over the cooking process, resulting in a perfectly fried egg with a tender white and a runny or slightly set yolk, depending on your preference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - hallway - light switch - candle - lamp - house Answer:","completion":"A candle is the most suitable light source that does not require electricity among the given options. A candle is made up of a wick embedded in a wax column. When the wick is lit, the heat from the flame melts a portion of the wax, creating a liquid pool. The liquid wax is drawn up through the wick by capillary action, supplying more fuel to the flame. This process continues until either the wick or the wax is depleted, causing the flame to be extinguished. Candles have been used for centuries as a light source, long before the advent of electric lighting. They were an essential means of illumination in homes, churches, and public buildings. Besides providing light, candles have also been used for religious ceremonies, meditation, and creating a sense of ambiance in various settings. Candles come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and designs, catering to different needs and preferences. They can be made from different types of wax, such as beeswax, paraffin, or soy wax. Some candles have scented oils added to create pleasant fragrances when burned. Compared to the other options provided, a hallway, light switch, lamp, and house, a candle stands out as the only one that does not depend on electricity to provide light. A hallway is merely a space in a building, a light switch is a device used to control electric lights, and a lamp is an electric light fixture designed to provide illumination. A house is a larger structure that might contain various light sources, which usually require electricity. While candles are a reliable light source during power outages or in locations without electricity, they should be used with caution. It is essential to keep them away from flammable materials, place them on stable surfaces to prevent tipping, and not leave them unattended while burning. Moreover, candles can produce a small amount of indoor pollutants, such as soot and certain volatile organic compounds when burned. It is crucial to ensure proper ventilation and avoid extended use to minimize potential health risks. Today, candles coexist with other non-electric light sources, such as oil lamps, solar lamps, and battery-operated lanterns. Each option has its pros and cons, depending on the specific situation and preferences of the user. However, in terms of simplicity, affordability, and historical significance, candles remain an enduring and viable alternative to electric lighting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
