Shouldn't be missed. When it comes to Thrillers, master of the genre Vijay 'Goldie' Anand's films are a case study, they had the most brilliantly crafted and longest climaxes ever, sometimes these climaxes formed the third act of the films and the twists in them will keep you on the edge of your seats even now, whether its Jewelthief or Johny Mera Naam. Most of these films were penned by K.A.Narayan saab, who is again known for writing the longest and most interesting climaxes, one of the most underrated climaxes by Narayan is for Victoria No.203 (that was spoofed wonderfully in the climax of Andaz Apna Apna, one of my most fav. Climaxes in Indian Cinema). As I just spoke about AAA Climax, I think we should also look at some of the funniest and most chaotic climaxes done by Priyadarshan, who brought the house down in the hilarious Hera Pheri climax. But the mother of insanely funny climax for me would be - Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. Its funny and ironical. Masterpiece of sorts. Another smartly crafted climax was in Waqt, the mother of all lost and found films, this epic film had a climax thats a court room scene and its around 50mins long. Another climax worth mentioning here is Khosla Ka Ghosla - a funny dysfunctional family drama suddenly becomes a con film by the climax and uses the classic 'land mine con' and pulls it off with elan. In the recent times, I have enjoyed the very over the top, and unbelievably filmy climax of otherwise realistic - Guddu Rangeela (But thats more like a guilt pleasure)."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"I don't know, if any body has already mention this or not, and if then sorry. \\"Writing in a bit hurry\\" The three pin socket: Use of three pin socket had arose questions in million/ billion minds especially in past few years. You all might have some question that, there are many appliances in home itself which easily runs on two pin sockets, then WHY using of THREE pin socket is feasible ? ? In this pin one can easily track the length of two parallel pins are similar (even if in mm's). ( Two pin plug) (2 pin socket) But in three pin you can easily find that the 3rd pin top most (when kept pin in vertical pose) is a bit longer in length. The reason behind this is safety of human. When ever the pin is pushed in the three pin socket, then the first pin to get in contact with socket will be the longest pin of 3 pin plug. Note: here I have attached many images to make other understand the difference between socket and plug. Whenever the 3 pin plug is pushed, the first pin to get in contact with the socket would the top most pin ( grounding pin).In earlier cases the the two pin sockets and plugs, when comes in contact with human body raises risk percentage of human body getting electric shock.But after applying the 3 pin socket and plug, the risk of electric shock to human body gets reduced to almost 0.The risk of shock gets reduced due to transfer of the current flowing path, in 2 pin cases the current flowing path starts from socket to human body, whereas in 3 pin socket and plug, the path starts from socket to 3rd pin (top most pin, grounded pin) of plug and gets grounded resulting least risk of electric shock. Another note: edit and suggestions are most welcome. EDIT: I forget to add more details about the current capacity of pin. For Higher current, there is a 15 Amp version of the same 3 Pin plug, usually called the Power Plug or the M Plug. Live and neutral are 1 inch (25.4 mm) apart. Earth terminal is 1+(1⁄8) in (28.58 mm) away from live and neutral terminals. Typically, refrigerators, heaters and other high power devices are connected to this 15 Amp socket.The two pin plug is also called the Europlug. It has two round 4 mm (0.157 in) pins. It can be inserted in either way into the socket. Hence there is no fixed live (hot) and neutral (cold) terminals.

Take MMA fighters for example: Some are built like absolute units, but most aren’t. Most special forces have physiques that, from a bodybuilder’s perspective, would be considered mediocre at best, as would most fighters. While size and strength is definitely an advantage in the cage, most fighters will attest that the larger, more muscular dudes tend to tire out quicker. In this regard, there are diminishing returns to size, because those muscles require fuel: something which is a precious commodity to the body during periods of extreme stress. While having a more muscular frame is certainly an advantage in rounds 1 and 2, that very advantage becomes a liability as a bout drags out, when the lungs are screaming for air, the legs are trembling from lack of oxygen, and arms feel like pool noodles. In the cage, there’s still a benefit: If a fighter can utilize that strength and size advantage to get an early submission or knockout, it can be worth the potential drawbacks. After all, weight classes DO exist for a reason, and against an evenly skilled opponent, a strength or weight advantage can make all the difference needed to secure a belt. In a combat environment, however, almost all of those benefits are mitigated by the fact that a 405lb Bench Press doesn’t make 5.56 fly any faster. The vast majority of the fighting will happen completely out of reach of your imposing biceps. While a good amount of muscle is essential in order to bear a combat load, bound from cover to cover, and employ weapons systems effectively, anything passed what is required for the mission becomes a detriment to the soldier in a firefight. Whereas Justin Gaethje might be fighting for an hour, soldiers are often operating at their absolute effort threshold for a dozen hours at a time, or more. Besides there being no operational need for excessive muscle mass, and it becoming a liability during periods of extreme stress, it is also nearly impossible to maintain that mass in a high-operational tempo environment. I can only speak as a straight-legged infantryman, but the training tempo in a good unit can make it impossible to gain any appreciable mass. When you’re operating in the field for weeks at a time, you carry only EXACTLY what you need. This applies to food, as well. As any bodybuilder will tell you, the time at the gym makes up only 1% of the muscle building process. The rest is in taking massive amounts of food, and monitoring sleep and recovery with a draconian eye. In the field, it’s not uncommon to go 24+ hours without sleeping or eating, to say nothing of combat. The body responds to these stressors by increasing levels of cortisol, which aids in alertness, but is also a catbolite. Meaning, it encourages the body to undergo catabolysis, where it switches to protein energy syntheses. During this process, the body begins to break down muscle tissue to convert into energy. The human body is not built to be as large as Mike Mentzer or Chris Bumstead. Evolutionarily, we’re more designed to look like a marathon runner. Any excuse the body can find to shed weight, it will. In summary, the reasons why operators don’t look like professional body builders is that: 1: There is no operational need for that mass, because we fight with bullets and bombs, not boxing gloves2: That mass would be an inherent liability anyways, from an energy conservation viewpoint3: That mass would be nearly impossible to achieve/maintain in a high operational tempo environment."},{"prompt":"Can I wear EarPods on a plane to keep my ears from popping?

I graduated high school several months after and entered college.

This is in February 2014. And I lost a lot of the weight and returned to my stable 106 lbs-ish here (I also forget how or why)- This is in a trip to Europe summer the same year: Then my lecture was held in an auditorium beside a minimarket for a year after that, and I went to buy ice cream every day there and gained all the weight I lost. Sigh. In my trip to Europe in summer 2015 I was even too shy to be photographed. I lost all those weight again and began taking better care of myself… Physically. I slowly lost weight and began to take care of my skin- but actually my skin began to break out badly here. Here’s me in March 2016- 8 months ago, graduating with my B.Med. At this moment, I’m actually at one of the lowest points in my life, and had a severe allergy to who-knows-what and my face felt rougher than sandpaper.

That could influence the number by a critical element.

I was at a personal inflection point in my life. My kids had moved out of the house, I didn’t “need” the big (and high cost) house with lots of bedrooms and it was time to move away from a long term, no pay situation with a startup I co-founded. So my wife and I talked through if we wanted to stay in CA or go somewhere else. On the positive side, California has a lot going for it. The weather is great, the technology industry is absolutely amazing, and the people there were always great. However, there were a lot of downsides for me personally that drove me away: No discussion can ignore the cost of living. Everything is expensive, not just housing. I now pay less for my housing, my electricity, gas, food and even my monthly haircut (at the same chain) is cheaper. Much of that flows back to the cost of property as every business has to add a bit of the cost of their location into the overhead of their business, but not all of it. As an example, I was paying about .25/kWh for electricity in CA (not easy to predict due to the tiered pricing system) and now pay .079/kWh, flat.One of the things that drive the cost of housing so high is that there are so many people there. But this has other impacts. Traffic is absurd, public transportation is over crowded, waiting lines to get into restaurants are long, the zoo is crowded, the parks are crowded, the schools are crowded… you get the point.On top of that if you are remotely conservative, or even pretty centrist you are treated like a pariah. I know more people than I can count who secretly voted for Trump in the last election and not one of them will admit it at work or in their friend circles. And those who have have been cast away. But if you don’t tow the progressive line on immigration, gun control or any other host of issues (and even did not vote for Trump) you’re in trouble. For examples of this, read the lawsuit complaint by the people suing google right now for unlawful termination. California, especially the bay area, has become the largest echo chamber in the country exhibiting fascist behavior in their zeal to protect the nation from fascists. (kind of ironic, no?)The state is downright hostile to business through regulations and over-taxation. So much so that numbers of companies are packing their bags and leaving, the most notable was Toyota moving to Texas a few years ago. But for every big business moving there are lots more small businesses doing so as well.And finally, the state is in financial trouble, although they have been able to paper over the issues with the ill-advised temporary tax increases passed via ballot proposition (how nice, one of the reasons I haste direct democracy) that has now become pretty much permanent via another ballot proposition. The state has a balanced budget and a surplus, that is if you don’t count the massive unfunded liabilities on the balance sheet. Not only that, but the state is highly dependent on the incomes of a pretty small number of people for a large part of their budget (I’ve read that 3% of the population pays 60% of the income tax) And those people generate a lot of their income via capital gains. So even small adjustments to the stock market can have HUGE impact on the CA finances. And at 13.6% there are plenty who are packing their bags and leaving. So yea, I packed my bags, sold my house and moved east. I’m happy I did, although there are things that I miss about CA. When I retire I may well buy a home there somewhere but I can assure you I will live there less than 180 days a year since I have no intent of being a CA resident ever again. (I won’t say I’ll never do it, since someone could make me an offer I can’t refuse and I might just go back)"},{"prompt":"What skills will help anyone make a significantly higher salary as an employee?","completion":"0.0 Believe in yourself: Most of the times, what happens is that people stop believing in themselves. Then, their bosses set them up with mediocre tasks to finish, that fill up their time. Since most of the tasks are to be done, but they are sub-par with a candidate's knowledge, the candidate loses interest very quickly. The jobs become repetitive, and there is no reward for repetitive jobs. Sometimes you may be so uninterested in the job, that you may not even finish it on time, and now you would be judged as a weak candidate, and you would be set up with even inferior tasks. The cycle may repeat year after year, and one may end up stagnating. 0.1 Admit your mistakes: The script most people usually begin playing is - my boss did that to me. My company did that to me. My peers did that to me. The reality is - that you let them do that to you. Instead of taking care of your own career, you let someone else take care of it, then success won't come to you. It is like this - You know that exercising is healthy for you, but because your boss has loaded you up with so much work, that you are left with no time, you sacrificed your exercise. In this case, no one but yourself must be blamed. It is not your boss's fault that you didn't exercise. It is your own fault. Same applies to your career. You did not take care of it, hence you may be suffering. It is not your boss's fault. These are some rules to hold on to so that you can shine in any job! 1. Quality comes before output: You should demonstrate great quality in whatever you do - the mails you write, the excel sheets you maintain, the computer programs you create, or whatever job you perform. If you do not demonstrate great quality, people would have to check your work, and that is energy absorbing. However, if you put efforts towards delivering great quality, you would build trust over years. I can tell you from my personal experience, that trust building is not an easy task, and without trust, you would never get a bigger task to do. 2. Control your mistakes: There are usually two types of mistakes people make and these very much point to two things. Aptitude, and Attitude. Aptitude simply means, that you made a mistake because of not knowing something. To eliminate such mistakes, constantly learn new things, and stay on the top of technology. And attitude means, that you made the mistake because of your carelessness. In any industry, mistakes happening out of both aptitude and attitude are harshly judged, more so, those arising out of attitude are even more harshly judged. You may even end up getting a tag of 'troublemaker'. 3. Do not do redundant tasks: These tasks must be avoided at all costs. You are not only wasting your own time, but your organization's time. Identify such tasks, and stay away from them. 4. Identify things that add value: Work on these things with great pride, and work super hard on these. 5. Identify things that reduce value: Work on eliminating them with great pride too. Note that these are not the same as redundant tasks. 6. Write down your plan of doing things: Without a plan, it is easy to get distracted and one may not achieve too much. Also, keep a good track of your plan. Every week, track your progress more than your boss, and you would note that your boss will begin trusting you more and more. Then he would say nice things about you to others. It is then others would notice your great work, and you would get recognition. 7. Create great teams: Work with a solid team of professionals who are career driven. You are simply an average of five people you meet the most. Change the group of people you interact with, and your value addition will also go up. 8. Reward people: When you reward others, others reward you. This would help you in building great teams in future, and it would be easier to then reap the benefits out of them. 9. Repeat continually: No one in the world has achieved success without repeating such steps again and again. Once you learn your own steps, continue repeating them systematically. 10. Stay happy and love your work: Last but not the least, love your work as much as possible. It is only then your career would change into a rewarding one. 11. Communicate really really well: Communication is key in this world, and if you become a really good communicator, you would build trust and you would get superior raises."},{"prompt":"IQ a good measurement of one’s intelligence?","completion":"Not at all my dear. While IQ can provide useful information about an individual's cognitive abilities, they have limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, IQ tests often measure only certain types of intelligence, such as logical-mathematical and linguistic intelligence, while neglecting other types of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and practical intelligence. Secondly, IQ tests may be culturally biased and may not take into account cultural differences or experiences that can affect performance. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair results for individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Thirdly, IQ tests measure only a narrow range of cognitive abilities and do not account for other factors that can affect overall intelligence, such as motivation, personality, and life experience. Lastly, IQ tests only provide a snapshot of an individual's cognitive abilities at a specific point in time and may not account for changes in cognitive abilities over time. In summary, IQ tests can provide some useful information about an individual's cognitive abilities, but they are not always an accurate or comprehensive measure of overall intelligence. Other factors need to be considered when assessing an individual's intelligence, including emotional intelligence, creativity, practical intelligence, and cultural background."},{"prompt":"Why is abortion such a big deal in America?","completion":"it is the religious nut cases and yes, I realize that is redundant"},{"prompt":"f Biden forgives student loan debt, why not cancel the GI Bill for veterans?","completion":"If.

But often franchise restaurants will slightly modify their recipes to local tastes and ingredients available. While in Europe in 1975, the American kids I traveled with were beyond happy to see the golden arches in Paris. They waited in line for nearly an hour to get a tiny BIG Mac Burger Royale, and an equally tinier paper packet of fries. Not a fan of that type of food, I watched them eat their Americanized stuff while I noshed on a street vendors’ baguette and saucisse sandwich, and for dessert, a crimson-colored sorbet with Cassis. But just 20 years later while traveling through Spain and southern France, I noticed a great deal of American style cafes or restaurants. They made sandwiches (Americans are all about the sandwiches and burgers, right?) and burgers. Seeing the imposters on the menu board and people eating them I had to laugh. We ordered what was supposed to be a grilled cheese sandwich. It was the thinnest, smallest slices of bread (like melba toast thin), with a slice of see-thru tomato, an equally thin sliver of cheese, that was a hard, not a melting cheese. It was a dismally unappetizing lunch offered with four (exactly four) potato chips, and a single tiny green olive. There was no butter, no mayonnaise (extra), no mustard (extra), and we were not enthused by their take on the American meal, which also was expensive. We could have imported an entire loaf of Velveeta or even cheddar cheese for its price. I see the trends in Mexican towns too. But sometimes the food ends up being weird locally sourced ingredients as a substitute, but good."},{"prompt":"w has being raised by extremely strict parents affected you as an adult?","completion":"Let’s see. I have anxiety and pretty-broken self-esteem. Many a time, I experience imposter syndrome and cry in secret. I tend to get nervous and babble while talking to even my friends even though I got no speech issues at all. I cannot initiate or continue conversations and always reply in “Yes, ok, agreed, correct, sure, np” etc. I am bad at creative writing. I fear touching new things for they will break. (My dad used to yell very badly if I broke even a very cheap thing). I have some attention retention problem which I feel was ignored by them for they were ignorant in this regard. Cannot talk to people in the eye or look forward while walking on the road, developed a bad habit of lowering my eyes most of the time. I am a Grammar/Punctuation Nazi (haha) But it’s alright! Yeah, sounds weird but, yes, I am grateful! I would not have been here had they not been strict. When I was born, sex determination was still legal & female foeticide was rampant in my country. They could have easily killed me in the womb itself or dumped me in some dustbin behind the hospital. (No, my parents never fed this in my head.) Moreover, my dad hates kids in general. But my parents were amongst the most educated lot in our family, so despite the despise, they brought me into this world. There have been numerous times I have had depressive episodes thinking how I have not done enough for them. Also, I am not happy with my career choice (it’s burdensome) but still I am thankful they persuaded me to go by their way. Today even during pandemic when numerous jobs were slashed, I still had a decent paying job. I will always be grateful and indebted to them. Shall we talk about positives now? I am well-mannered as compared to most of the people I encounter. I have never used abusive language or misogynist curses. I have higher level of tolerance. I have an “I am willing to listen to you” attitude. I have profound respect towards people with more knowledge and experience than me - I’d say this is a more cultural thing here. I grew up in a no-internet environment so I was not exposed to the toxicity that teenagers today grow up in. I have a very strong attachment with my parents. Many a times, I dreamt of them dying and even woke up crying 555. I am responsible - ready to be the head of the family in their absence. Not into drugs, alcohol or any other narcotics. Follow rules. Honest. They sacrificed their sleep to wake up early and cook healthy food for me instead of handing me some cash to buy junk food. Today I have no allergies, deficiency, diseases etc. Personally, I feel parents should be strict but not dictatorial or abusive. If they are not, the child is bound sway on a self-destructive path. Many confuse strictness with physical abuse. It’s completely different. If I become a parent tomorrow, I will be like them, no second thoughts about it. But I’ll work more on few things from my side and those would be - 1) Bonding by physical touch like hugs, caresses etc. 2) Communication gap 3) Extra curriculars like martial arts, classical arts, foreign language to develop confidence in personality Cheers! <3"},{"prompt":"Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?","completion":"Language is an uniting factor in Europe. England, France, Germany, Spain etc.countries are formed on the basis of languages. Definitely the language and culture of the particular region unites the people. In India, the union of diversities,languages have divided the people. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Punjab etc. states were formed on the basis of majority seaking language. The love between two people of different states is decreasing. Now every state is behaving like an independent country. Is Hindi language uniting Indians? Yes it is uniting. It has been successful in uniting more than seventy percent people(surveys misled). Hindi is not taught regularly in schools of few states only. Most Indians have accepted Hindi as link, useful , communicable or as like national language. Some people may like it or not like it. But the truth is Urduvised Hindi is regularly spoken in army, railways, most nationalised banks, post offices and the places where a link language is needed. English is regularly spoken in airports, stock markets, in the chambers of government officers and higher education centres. But English is no match for the popularity of Hindi. Some people from South India are extremely unhappy about the imposition of Hindi as national or a major link language. But in the absence of another such language Hindi is going to rule India. The 15–20 percent Muslims who speak Urdu are indirectly promoting Hindi. Combine Hindi and Urdu speakers you shall understand their strength! I belong to Karnataka. I know more use of Hindi may bite Kannada. But Kannadigas should know that a mere opposition to Hindi is not going to help in the development of the state.Hindi speaking people in the state have contributed well. In the last 65 years of formation of Karnataka Kannadigas have failed to bring Kannada fully in medical, Science, Engineering and Law colleges. In the last 20 years they are failing to produce good quality literature, movies also and induce pride in the language. Naturally Hindi and English are filling in the ‘blanks'!

Similarly Shiva is everywhere in Vedas an ignorant may understand it or not. Because most people are unlearned who have actually not read Vedas or scriptures but simply follow some Daassas or sinful organisations, than vomit there sick minds false and ill knowledge. Here I would try to be precise but fact full because elaborating Vedas about Shiva, there so much of material that it will become a new Veda itself as it will be explanatory in metaphysical and scientific terms too because Shiva has inherent connection with science the scientific community recognizes him as Alpha and Omega for that they also have installed huge Nataraj Shiva,s Idol in front of HOLY GRAIL of science The Hadron collider LHC at the Heart of CERN. The point is when some one or say in plural,when human wanted to know greatest or most basic reason for this entire cosmos having infinite galaxies at the utmost humanly possible depth they have found it to be SHIVA. Hence the Vedic Rishis who were scientists of Meta Physical realm who USED TO FREQUENT BETWEEN PARALLEL UNIVERSES also researched and found Shiva or Rudra as the Greatest Tattwa, The final god The reason the Cause of all the Effects of the Universe and they have elaborated there research and described Shiva as greatest God ultimate. So even by science you wont stumble upon jesus or any other Sanatana Gods or so called human made Gods but, SHIVA ONLY ,the formless base of Universe the power of all the energy factor of universe. Dr. John Haglin Einstien of this age, among scientists Describe Shiva of Vedas as Quantum Unified field, The power behind entire existence infinite Cosmos and all Big Bangs, which is reality and science of Shiva Lingam, Shiva Lingam is a technical and True shape of Godly Supra Energy Vortex the formless form of quantum unified field. To explain this we need another answer,but that will be a different subject, But the point is scientists and true seekers whenever they found ultimate truth through Spirituality or through Science have found ONLY SHIVA as Finality from where nothing goes beyond every thing ends and emerges from here Only. So Here i will elobarate how Rig Veda than all other Vedic texts of all Four Vedas and there branches and cover verifiable Facts and truth, not hear say or any cults false doctrines But pure Vedic God Shiva, no Smriti or other Scriptures. Check How Sir and Dr John Hagelin describes Vedic Shiva as silent Ruler most powerful most beautiful the Alpha and Omega. Dr. Hagelin Reveals The Reality Of The Silent Ruler Of The Universe Shiva As Expressed By The Superstring Of The Unified Field. Vedas sing more eulogies of Shiva Rudra or Raudragni, Jaatveda Than any other Lord or Gods. Even from the very first Shloka Mantra of very first Veda The Rig Veda they started Singing praises of Rudra Shiva and his major eight forms which covers entire universe with five elements and Pran, Atman and Pradhan. If you will read the first Veda, It starts from praying Shiva Rudra from very first Shloka, “Agni milite Purohitam” , (Agni is Shiva or Rudras Form one of his eight Vedic manifestations). There are several Suktas dedicated only to him. In Rig Veda and in fact same is the case with other three Vedas Rudra Shiva is everywhere in Aranyaks, Bramhans, Upnishads, Gyan khand ,karma kand, Jyotish, vyakaran i mean, where you wont find him when you read how Vedas describe him its like looking for gold in mine full of gold and and some nerd asks where is gold in the mine, well it is still here not only one can see but one can experience it too. So Rudra is mentioned in Shlokas, Mantras, Suktas (for which You will have plenty of evidence from real text below in this write up) even whole Upanishads are dedicated to him only. The Gyan khand of Vedas which is main part of Vedas metaphysical science is known as Upanishads. Now among 108 Valid Upanishads of Muktika Cannon from all four Vedas more than 42 + (16 unpublished Upanishads) are dedicated to Shiva exclusively and inclusively. And That is more than half of total text, And that is much much more than any other single Gods eulogy in Vedas, How else glory of greatest God would be sung if not like this. In the Shatarudriya and in the whole Veda, Rudra is called Siva, Sankara, Sambhu, Isana, Isa, Bhagavan, Bhava, Sarva, Ugra, Soma, Pasupati, Nilagriva, Girisa, Mahadeva and Mahesvara among thousands of other names. Vedic Hymns The MahaRudrashtadhyayee. The most famous and Longest eulogy among all, The Rudrashtdhyayi which consists of Eight major Suktas belongs to Shiva Rudra Only, it is the Greatest Longest most powerful eulogy Vedas have ever sung for a Single God Head among all other Vedic Gods. In Shiva Rudra merge all Gods, The ShatRudriyam or Shree Rudra Sukta or Rudra Neela Sukta is repeated in all Vedas many times not only in Both Shukla and Krishna Yajurveda, than Rig Veda also has so many Rudra Sooktas, Atharva Veda and Saamveda have way many Suktas mantras for Shiva Rudra and his synonyms. This is most repeated eulogy in all Vedas and its various branches. Search net and find 1000 of links for Rudri at you tube, Shiva is the only Godhead for whom greatest and longest and most powerful eulogy was made, None other God commands such high respect, fear and awe that even Panch Bramhas bow in front of him (Ganpati Kartik, Durga, Vishnu, surya and Rudra). The Rudrabhishekam with Rudram MahaNyasam is most elaborated methodical worship in Karma Kanda Khand, of any single Vedic God ever. The Worship ceremony is so powerful that even if it is still done rightly miracles do happen, ask any astrologer about, what he would consider the most powerful Upay or Solutions for things, he must suggest, all would suggest Mahamrityunjay Jaap ,Rudrabhsihekam and Shat chandi as most powerful solutions for any mundane or spiritual thing, thus still millions of people organize it and get what they want with simple good. Its sung in all major Shiva Temples everyday. And about this great eulogical Worship and this mantra scripture Declared that VR^ixasya mUlakena shakhAH puShyanti vai yathA | shive rudrajapAtprIte prItA evAsya devatAH | ato rudrajapAdeva bhuktimuktiprasiddhyataH || Even as by (watering) the roots of a tree, all its branches are nourished, so by pleasing Shiva with the chant of the Rudram , all the gods are pleased. Therefore, the attainment of bhukti - enjoyment - and mukti - liberation- is only through chanting the Rudram with devotion. Vedas saw and witnessed him as Final God, The God of all Gods, The father of Trinity, and whole universe, who has no body above him, there is no one beyond or second to him,”Eko hi Rudro na Dwiteeyay”. He is alone Swayambhu (Self Reliant) and (Beejak) Seed Giver of entire existence and Vishnu is Yoni (Womb) of universe, “Vishnurvishwa JagatYonih” Shiva is Reason of all the Causes and Cause of every Effect “Karnam Parama Kaaranat”. Vedas Declared him Sovereign Lord of all that exists, “Vishwadhipo Rudrah Maharshih”. (YajurVeda) The one in front of whom all Gods including Bramha and Vishnu have accepted there animal instinct, and declared him as Pashupati The lord of all gods and all beings “Sarwe Deva Pashutamvapu Swayam Tasmat Pashupatir Babhoov”. (Yajur Veda) The Only God head whose energies never depart from him, “īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam”. (Rig Veda) Who is above time the Kaala, the one and only Mahakaala and Sadashiva Rudra. “Yo Vampaden jaghan Kaalam”. He kicked Kaal and subdued him, he Time favours him and his bhaktas always. All Four Vedas were very peculiar, straightforward and truthful about Him. He was referred frequently as None like others, The one and Only without a second, No one but Him, “Sa Eko Rudro dheyah Sarvesham”, “ Eko Hi Rudro”, “Aek aiwa Shivo”, “Saeesh aesh aive Rudro”. Even they went to the extent to declare that, leave all Gods who are Pawns of MahaRudra instead worship Him only, through One pointed high Devotion. “Aek aiwa Shivo nityastato anyatsakalam mrisha tasmat sarwanparityajya Dhyeyaan Vishnawadikansuran” (Atharvaveda). These are the kind of ways Vedas tell about him and read Vedas they do not confer that status to any other God so highly and frequently, declaring the Code of Adwait, That the truth is God is one, Jeeva is fragment or Shiva God. Hence Jeeva is also Shiva, or to say that to become Shiva is Goal of every Jeeva because it is fragment of Shiva. In Shwetashwatar Upnishad, all Rishis have assembled together and did Shastrarth research on Param Bramha God, they came to know that discussion wont be able to establish the truth hence they all meditated for several celestial years with an inquiry that who is that one from whom everything comes and merges in, who is existent before time who is that One Final God of Gods who has no body above, nothing beyond. And after many years and continuous Samadhi (Ultra Aplha State of Mind) it was Revealed to Bramha Rishi, Shwetashwatar he got enlightened and he floating in ether with immense bliss and divine illumination declared to all Rishis Thus spake the great Rishi in second shloka mantra of third adhyay (chapter) of Shwetashwatar Upnishad of YajurVeda, which is one of the prime 6 Upnishads :- Eko hi Rudro na dvitīyāya tasthurya imāṃl lokān īśata īśanībhiḥ / pratyaṅ janās tiṣṭhati saṃcukocāntakāle saṃsṛjya viśvā bhuvanāni gopāḥ // 3.2 // Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner Self of every living being. After having created all the worlds, He, their Protector, takes them back into Himself at the end of time. Not only this Upanishad but YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6, clearly states Rudra as Pashupati and Lord of sacrifices and as The Greatest One God without a second. .\\"Pasunam sarma asi sarma yajamanasya sarma me yacha Eka Eva Rudro Na Dvitiyaya Tasthe Akhusthe Rudra Pasuh Tam Jushasva. YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6. We Pray to Lord of all Sacrifices and The Lord of all Gods who is Rudra only the greatest Lord of entire cosmos who has none as second, and all beings and Gods are his Pets (Pashus) and he alone is there master there sole lord The Pashupati. Now those cultists who say Rudra is different from Shiva those fools shall read something truthful rather than vomiting there dirt here, Rudra is frequently referred in Vedas as Shiva, 'Shivo namasi' (Yaj. S. 3-63) clearly calls him Shiva than. The Famous and most popular among masses Panachkashar mantra is Pure Vedic the Central Mantra, where other popular mantras are not Vedic necessarily, Panchakshar Mahavidya Mantra is established in the very heart of all Vedas deliberately in Yajurvedas the MANTRA occurs in Taittareeya . 4. 5, 1-41. \\"Namah shambhave cha mayobave cha namah Sankaraya cha mayaskaraya cha NAMAHA SH1VAYA cha Sivataraya cha\\" And the famous Satarudriyam OR RudraNeel Suktam which is highly praised in the Upanishadas and in the Purans & Mahabharat etc, forms also the central portion of this central Veda. And this is a description of God as the all, the all in all, and transcending all, 'Visvadevo, Visvasvarupo, Visvadhiko. Rudra as Pashupati - lord of all beings including all Gods and humans and animals. Mohenjodaro a culture 7500 years ancient shows that Shiva Lingam and shiva as Pashupati was the main deity of those times in all over the world. A Pashupati Seal found there is very famous among archaeologists and anthropologists. And the Root of Pashupati is of course In Vedas. Shiva is declared as Pashupati in Vedas and Pashus (animals) are not what you think, Pashupati does,nt mean Lord of animals but entire universe and all Sentient beings and all Gods accepted that they are Pashus because of having animal instinct and being inflicted by Panch Pashas (Five affliction) which influence all beings even Bramha or Vishnu or Avataras are afflicted by these Five Pashas hence including them entire Universe of beings are Pashus (Pets of Shiva), and he alone is Pashupati there Master There owner, Pashupati does,nt mean lord of animals but Lord of all beings who are always afflicted with Five Pashas, chains and everything that exists and gods are also chained by these pashas (like lust, anger, false ego, envy, selfishness etc) All devas agreed including Vishnu Bramha Indra and performed Pashupat Vrat to appease shiva so he would absolve there pashas and set them free. Whenever Vishnu takes avatar he performs PAHSUPAT Vrata. In Bible also The God is called Shepherd and all beings as his flocks or Sheeps or animals, this allegory has root in this Vedic incidence only asserts scholars. How he came to be known as such, Here is the description-: Yajur Veda, 6th Kanda, 2nd Prasna, 3rd Anuvaka and 12th Mantra. Mahapuram Jayantiti ta ishum Samas Kurva to gnium anikan Soman Salyam Vishum Tejanam the bruvan ka imam asishatita Rudra iti aleruvan rudro vai Krura; Somya twiti, sobravit Varam Vrina aham eva Pasunam Adhipatirasaniti tasmat rudrah Pasunam adhipatishtam rudrova Srijat Satisra Puro bhitva ebhyo: lokebhys Suran pranudata. \\"There were the three cities of iron, silver, and gold (belonging) to Asuras. The gods not being able to win them (by fight) wished to win them by siege. (The great) say that He (the Brahmin &c), who knows (what ought to be known) and he (the non-Brahmin &c), who does not know - they are able to win by seige the great city which cannot be overtaken by fight: Then the gods made an arrow composed of Agni as (the bottom hilt) Soma as (the middle) iron and Vishnu as (the top) and declared (consulted) who will discharge it, and determined None but MahaRudra, (was) as only and Greatest God amongst them all, being capable of discharging such an apocalyptic weapon which carried all the weight and might of all Devas. Upon hearing such request) He (The Rudra) said the boon was made over, From Now on whole Universe must know the truth and accept that I am the Lord of Infinite Cosmos, all of you, all Gods and all beings are my Pashus (pets afflicted by five pashas ), hence all are Pashus both the two-footed Devas and manushyas and four-footed; So Rudra the Lord of Pashus, The Pashunampatim discharged it, broke up these three cities, and blew them up all from these worlds.\\" Aum namo bhagavate RudrAya In this Mantra, the Highest Reality, Brahman is identified with Rudra who is MASTER of Trinity who assigned the three functions of creation, protection or maintenance and dissolution of the universe to three Gods. The epithet Rudra means the destroyer of all that is false or evil, ignorance and their effects, sin sorrow and suffering and who confers wisdom and [LINKED_TEXT: http://bliss.In] [URL: http://bliss.in/] the Rig Veda Rudra is the personification of Brahman in three rounded aspect. In the later portion of the Veda, Rudra is described as Siva, the auspicious, as Mahadeva, the great God. Vedas also say about two aspects of Shiva viz., The Ghora meaning fierce the terrible and Aghora, Saumya meaning the benevolent kind and auspicious . The Upanishad speaks about Brahman as Rudra, its teaching lays stress on the destruction of Sin and Agyan (ignorance) by Shiva worship and great Spiritual progress. Rig Veda starts from praying to Shiva Agnimilite Purohitam ,and Agni is one of the eight manifestations of Rudra as mentioned above, Agni is also called Prana, and Prana is Rudra (Brihadaranyak Upnishad), Sashpinjaray twasheemate (Shatrudriya Shukla Yajurveda), says We bow to the god who is fire (Agni) flaming bright Red and yellow divine hue. And there are many places where Agni, Rudra, Prana, Atman, Parmatman, are said to be synonyms and used in interpolating ways. The RigVeda 6.49.10 calls Rudra as “Bhuvanasya Pitraah” The Father of the Universe. Bhuvanasya pitaram ghīrbhirābhī rudram divā vardhayā rudramaktau | brhantam rshvamajaram sushmnam rdhagh ghuvema kavineshitās. “Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father. Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us. Now examine how else Vedas would describe the greatest Lord who is god of all Gods and entire universe. They revere him as “Bhuvansya Pitrah” ,the father of entire existence of beings and Cosmos, So he is not a simple Deity or warrior God as unlearned dumb people say but he is regarded as Supreme God Head, Father of entire universe who has no body above or beyond there is no body equal or second to him. He is sovereign Lord The Master of Entire existence, and this declares all Vedas Unanimously thousands of times and this assert Rig veda more in this Mantra The Rig Veda, 2.33.9 calls Rudra as \\"The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe\\" Iśānādasya Bhuvanasya . Sthirebhiranghaih pururūpa ughro babhruh śukrebhih pipiśehiranyaih | īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam || 'With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations: The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign God of this Universe , the All mighty.' Now Veda is mentioning Shiva Rudra as Iśānādasya, The soveriegn GODHEAD of bhuvanasya bhūrerna, Entire Universe three worlds all which exists and beyond. Or does any clearer words are needed to convey and understand logically and truthfully and honestly that Rudra or Shiva is regarded as Supreme most God Head who is self energized whose ultimate super most power never departs from him, who is father and guardian of entire Universe and all Gods and beings. Than Rig Veda 2.33.10 Na vā ojīyo rudra tvad asti A Mighter and Greater than you there is none, O Rudra. Rig Veda 7.46.1, Aṣālhāya sahamānāya vedhase. Rig Veda. 2.33.3. Whom no one may overcome. Tavastamas tavasā Mightiest of the mighty. The most famous Shiva Mantra Tryambak Mantra or MahaMrityunjay mantra is in Rig Veda, Rig Veda 7.59.12. Tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam Urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality. kad rudrāya pracetase mīḍhuṣṭamāya tavyase। vocema śaṃtamaṃ hṛde (RigVeda 1.43.1) What shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise, That shall be dearest to his heart? RigVeda 2.33.8 maho mahi suṣṭutim īrayāmī, gṛṇīmasi tveṣaṃ rudrasya nāmaḥ. I utter forth mighty hymn of praises.We sing the splendid name of Rudra. Now on gyan khand part or Upnishad Khand, not some hymns or shloka but entire Upnishads are dedicated to him as God Supreme These are Upanishads of Rig Veda dedicated to Shiva. ,Nirvana Upanishad, Atma Bodh Upanishad, Akshamalika Upanishad, Naad Bindu Upnishad. There is no point referring shlokas of these Upnishads as they are totally devoted to shiva Principle Tattva. kumāraś cit pitaraṃ vandamānam prati nānāma rudropayantam (RigVeda 2.33.12) I have surrendered myself to you as a boy to the respected father approaching. bhiṣaktamaṃ tvā bhiṣajāṃ śṛṇomī (RigVeda 2.33.4) I hear you as the most curing among all curing. Haste vibhrad bheṣajā vāryāṇī śarma varma chardira (RigVeda 1.114.5) Whose hand filled of sovran medicines. Grant us refugee, protection and shelter. apabhartā rapaso daivyasyābhī (RigVeda 2.33.7) Deliverer from defect of the Gods. bṛhantamṛṣvamajaraṃ (RigVeda 6.49.10) bhūrer dātāraṃ (RigVeda 2.33.12) The giver of many. mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtā (RigVeda 7.59.12) who provides immortality through Moksha. 6) Revealing of Desire of Rudra Consciousness: RigVeda also reveals about state which sages seek where perfect thoughts of Lord Rudra comes to their mind. ie. Wishing of full mind devotion to Lord Rudra: ā te pitara marutāṃ sumnam etu (RigVeda 2.33.1) May your perfect thought come to us Oh father of Maruts. ā vivāseyaṃ rudrasya sumnam (RigVeda 2.33.6) May perfect thought of Rudra comes in mind. Lord Rudra in Vedas has one peculiar characteristic ie. He is stated as the one without second. YajurVeda Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6 clearly states 'Eka Eva Rudro Na Dwitiya.' ie. 'Rudra yields noone to second.' Now a question arises whether this is just Arthavãda or has special significance. It is not Arthavãda because same verse is derived by Svetasvatara Upanishad in 3.1 and used as to glorify Brahman 'Eko hi Rudro Na Dwitiyaya... '. So, Lord Rudra is the one who is without second. Same thing is also revealed in Rudra Suktas of RigVeda: also Shivas fragment, which Shree Shankaracharya re established again. He is no regular God, He can absolve any Karma change destiny and capable of giving well being of all kinds here and in afterworlds. He is the greatest Surgeon greatest Healer The Vaidynatham. And he can liberate Give moksha to his Devotees Kaivalya Bramha . Those who worship him with devotion are devoid of death or any thing negative. Both Yajurveda and Rig veda declare Shiva as Most terrifying Destroyer of Gods and Death even (Ghora), and both consider him as Ultra benevolent greatest healer and happiness giver who can enlighten and change destiny if needed for welfare of bhakta (Aghor) who protects and prospers his worshipers.

The US was one of the few colonies of the British Empire who earned their independence through war. I wont go into the reason for the war because the skeleton of that long dead horse is still being beaten on here but basically the Colonies wanted a seat at the table and weren't given one. Since there was no standing American army at the time then where did our soldiers come from. Well they were the farmers, shop owners, dock workers, slaves, and woodsmen who made up the army and especially in the early days they were armed with their own personal weapons. While militia was crucial early on after 1778 the continental Army came into its own come out of Valley Forge. And even after that point militia served a huge part even if it wasn't bearing the brunt of the battles. Especially early in the war preventing Cornwallis from moving north to join Howe/Clinton in crushing the Army under General Washington. Daniel Morgan was very adept at using militia, with the militia playing a key role in the victories at Saratoga and at Cowpens. Now why is militia important to this argument. The militia’s were mostly armed with their own weapons, using a weapon you aren't familiar with you aren't gonna be proficient with which means that you are fairly useless in battle. In fact the militias had an impact later on in the war of 1812 in support roles. In particular the major US victories of New Orleans and Plattsburg. But apart from that they believed that everyone had the right to protect themselves, their families and their property. They believed this to be a God given right not a right coming from a piece of paper. The Native Americans who raided settlements could have done a lot more damage had the local populace had to wait for someone to come to their aid. So in summary the founding fathers believed that an armed populace was necessary to prevent 3 things. An oppressive government, fast defeat at the hands of a foreign foe, need for a large standing military."},{"prompt":"Am I wrong in believing that both Democrats and Republicans have poisoned the well by using prejorative terms like communist, fascist, Russian bot, Chinese bot, etc.?","completion":"There is only one political side that would poison a well and that’s the Democrats, When Republicans call Democrats socialist or communist it’s because of the things they say they want to do and the way they act towards the other side of the political isle as well as the methods and tactics they deploy that are no different than those of an authoritarian or socialist style government And on the other hand Democrats call Republicans fascist because Democrats have a really bad habit of accusing others of what they are guilty of themselves, and Democrat leaders know that what ever they say or however they mislabel others their loyal supporters will eagerly and blindly echo the same things they hear their political leaders say….

Being the person who has to leave is very difficult. Note: While writing this, I saw that this is going to be a long one. If I do end up posting this, it’s more for me than it is for anyone else. If you have read this, I hope I was able to provide some insight as to why people stay in abusive relationships from my own personal story. I was married from January 2014 to August 2016. Dating and Marriage:I had met my ex while I was in South Korea teaching English. She was South Korean, born and raised in South Korea. And when we were dating, she was the perfect girlfriend. Caring, kind, supportive. I’ve had many relationships but I thought she was the one. When I wanted to return to the US as I didn’t want to teach anymore, I wanted her to be with me still. So, I proposed to which she said yes. Decline:When we were dating in South Korea, we lived in a metropolitan city with many amenities and things to do. She was a city girl, through and through. Suburban life might as well have been rural life to her. She blamed me for taking her away from her country. Blame lead to resentment. Resentment lead to hate.Ultimately, we became toxic to each other. Abuse:Emotional, mental, physical. She called me weak, immature, stupid, etc. I wasn’t any of these things but I became these things. I second-guessed myself every time. I was afraid to make mistakes that I ended up making mistakes. Small mistakes like driving over the curb because I had turned a little bit too sharp was met with a barrage of insults. Being called stupid in public in front of people, my confidence was absolutely shot. Alcohol was the cause of her physical abuse. I will remember all of our fights, she does not. She became a completely different person when she was drunk. Speech slurred, glossed eyes, randomly screaming, spitting on the carpet/on me, punching/kicking holes into the wall, punching/biting/kicking me. I would have to barricade her in our bedroom until she passed out which was always at 4am. Our first physical fight, she was deeply apologetic after as she saw the damage she did to our home and me. Our next four physical fights, she didn’t care at all and blamed it on the alcohol. Rationalizing Abuse:NEVER could this happen to me. I can NEVER be stupid enough to be with someone who abuses me. Until you are. Every fight that you have, you start blaming yourself. Maybe you could’ve done something differently. Maybe you could’ve been more supportive. Just make sure she doesn’t drink anymore and you won’t have incidents like this. I was defeated. My confidence at an all time low. I couldn’t and didn’t want to tell this to my family and friends because it was embarrassing and shameful. I didn’t want them to worry. Divorce:I remember this fight vividly. She doesn’t because she was completely wasted on alcohol. She wanted to leave our home in her completely intoxicated state with car keys in hand. I put myself between the door and her to prevent her from leaving. This lead to a fight which lead to her being arrested for domestic violence and me sent to the hospital. I still have scars from that fight. This was the first time outside people were involved, including our families.Her parents in South Korea wanted her home immediately. The divorce was quick and relatively smooth. We both knew it was done and she was desperate to go back to South Korea. Aftermath:I was never diagnosed but I can say that what I felt afterwards was PTSD. Certain moments would trigger anxiety attacks which had me vocally screaming to forget. I told my friends what happened but that I didn’t want to talk about it, that the best thing for me at the time was life as usual. I had trust issues for a looong time. Even when I went back to dating, I would think… okay, this girl is kind now but she can also be violent as well. Now:It has been five years since and a lot of it is water under the bridge. It took time and other methods to recover. My last triggering moment was when I saw the South Korean movie, Parasite. There was a scene in which one of the main actresses became drunk and belligerent. Conclusion:I don’t have advice that you have not heard before. All I can say is that I know how being in an abusive relationship feels like and I hope that anyone who is in one is able to get out of it."},{"prompt":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","completion":"1000 years isn’t long enough to assume drastic things purely by nature without human intervention. However, based on that, if ethnic lines cross over culturally and reproductively, we may likely lean into being almost uniracial-yet-mixed with near everything. If the atmosphere lessens in ultraviolet radiation, we may get slightly lighter, but not by much. If it worsens, then darker complexions would likely be the norm. That, however, implies it goes further north, whereas the most ultraviolet radiation is in the southern hemisphere (Sup-Saharan Africa, South American, Southern India, Pacific Islands, Aboriginal Australians, etc.).

Generally, both operating systems are excellent for doing creative stuff. In the long past, Windows may be a lesser attractive choice. But for today, Windows has been excellent. Even it’s better for certain work. In games and VFX industries which heavily uses GPU and custom-built computer, Windows is much preferred. The same for 3D modeling, CAD, or architecture; most industry-standard tools are more compatible with Windows machines. For graphic design and 2D illustration, both Mac OS and Windows are great. It seems like Mac OS is still better for music and audio production. You might also consider the majority of users around you.

Making the country unrecognisable. Of course I don’t mean by buildings or public works. But they represented a mass extinction event. And the flora and fauna that survived had to evolve to coexist with those aboriginals. The environment changed quite dramatically. As it has to when any dramatic new set of conditions apply. Whether by global warming, a Tunguska meteor, tectonic plate shifts, ice ages or a new imported pest or disease. Environments adapt.

Let me pose a question to you that may shake up those grey cells and get them functioning again. How would the UK and Russia have won WITHOUT the Lend/Lease Program from the US? The UK had neither the material resources nor the manufacturing, the oil nor foodstuffs to fight a protracted war of the type that Germany was waging. On the other hand, Russia had the raw resources but not the technology advances nor the advances manufacturing to be able to pump out the enormous amount of machinery, weapons, or ammunition without the time that the Lend/Lease Program bought them. Without the equipment from the US, the Germans would have rolled over the USSR like a storm…because they would have been fighting poorly armed farmers. It wasn’t JUST the US soldiers that helped win the war…it was the enormous amount of materials that the US sent over that bought the Allies the time to spin up their war machine so they could actually fight."},{"prompt":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","completion":"In the US Military, things are almost always planned for. There are rally points, fallback locations, rest/refuel/re-arm spots. Additionally, soldiers (or airmen, seamen, or marines) are never alone, even a two-man team is unusual. A soldier (or airman, seaman, or marine) who is out of reach of his unit, is not going to happen (under most circumstances, in these modern times). A platoon or squad will know that they are in the red with ammunition (red meaning low, black meaning too low to be mission capable). They know it's time to call off the mission, call for backup, or rally to a previous location. Command usually does not want a mission to fail, so the unit will almost always be able to get the ammunition or backup that they need. Sometimes, however, contingencies fail. Sometimes, units get ambushed, and a soldier might possibly become separated from any surviving team members. Sometimes, stuff just happens, and it would be folly to say otherwise. It is generally considered bad form to pick up an enemy weapon. 1. It is immoral to “loot” dead soldier's. 2. It is against US Army regulations to loot dead soldiers. 3. It is against the laws of war and Geneva Convention to loot dead soldiers. 4. If you want the citizens of the country you are in to trust and like you (as in the Iraq War), then you do not do the things that the Ministry of Misinformation (actually called Saddam's Ministry of Information, but we called it like we saw it) tells the people that you will do. E.g. looting, raping, pillaging, needlessly killing innocent civilians, etc. You instead act cordially and humanely to the populace that you are “liberating”. (I used quotation marks because while we might see it as liberating, their opinion might differ) 5. Enemies have been known to booby-trap weapons. Even dead soldiers have had the forethought to ensure that their death takes out other enemies. I don't have any research or evidence; but, I was told stories (from multiple SNCOs) about enemy soldiers lying face down dead, who were rolled over, and the enemy soldier held a live grenade, without a pin, under him, which exploded, taking out his enemy. If I am not mistaken, this was stories about the VC in the Vietnam War. 6. The weapon that the enemy has is not a weapon that you are proficient with. (Imagine being skilled in using a short sword, and you pick up someone's longsword, you aren't going to be as good with it as the ones who train with it). It is the same with firearms. Even a specialized soldier who has trained on multiple weapons and can pick up any weapon and be proficient, will tell you that he will use it sparingly, because he knows that he is at a disadvantage to an enemy who uses it everyday. 7. You have not cleaned or maintained that weapon (do you even know how to take it apart? Which pieces need the most lubrication? How to perform immediate action, when it misfires?). The enemy may not have cleaned or maintained it very well either. (Such was the case with a majority of the AK 47s and other weapons and equipment which we found in Iraq). 8. Ammunition. What are you going to do when you run out of that ammunition. 9. Soldiers (airmen, seamen, marines) know the sound of their weapons fire. They also know the sound of the enemy's weapons fire. You don’t want to make yourself into a target of your own troops. All that being said, if a soldier (aitman, seaman, or marine), or even a team, that finds himself alone with no ammunition, no means of communication, and no guidance, will definitely take the risk of picking up an enemy weapon and using it rather than be defenseless. No command is going punish you for doing so either. It should be noted that if you are found to have picked up and used one, unauthorized, without necessity, you could face military charges for it. If that soldier still has it in his possession when he is reunited with his command, he will have to relinquish the weapon. Under no circumstances, is the enemy weapon going to be able to remain in his possession, once he is on friendly ground. So, no, it is not allowed. Yes, extenuating circumstances could make it excusable. No, its not a good idea, even under the most extreme duress. Yes, even though it is a bad idea, if it is your last choice, do so. Personally, I would rather hide than use an enemy weapon…because of the reasons that I previously stated, it has the potential to be more deadly of a decision than simply falling back, hiding, or playing dead."},{"prompt":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","completion":"Hi Sajid: I got The Girl with the Dragon T-shirt.

No one wants to be the guy who has to retract a big announcement. But on the other hand, they are motivated to publish. I would expect some cautionary, guarded remarks days after discovery. It is unlikely that anything could be quickly confirmed and there would be debate over what was found. But I think we’d hear about it before the debate was 100% settled. Would it indicate alien life? Ye. It would indicate that the organism once existed billions of years ago. But it would not prove that anything still lives on Mars or anyplace else. But the proof of extinct life would mean that microscopic life might be common in the universe."},{"prompt":"What piece of evidence do we have that reproduction of humans on Earth started with two people?","completion":"Since believing in things known to be false is an integral part of the Faith for many believers, it’s kinda beside the point to come up with evidence against Genesis.

Assuming 1 USD= 1 INR An average software engineer who is earning 43k per month ( As per the 2015 survey) in India will receive 43k USD ( because 1 INR = I USD) while an average software engineer in USA earns 10k USD per month. Consequences: Eventually all the foreign companies will vanish from India because labour cost is too high in India i.e., 43k USD whereas in USA its just 10k USD. All the Indian companies will migrate to some other parts of the Globe where the labour cost is low.India will loose 40 million jobs and then due to unemployment they will again start working for low salaries but their loans and other commitments are already prescribed with previous standard economy and they will not be able to repay their debts.The Indian economy and all the banking corporation will collapse . In order to balance this situation. RBI will have to print more currency causing inflation (All the prices of goods goes high). Conclusion: As Inflation hits the sky, which weakens Indian economy. That means 1 INR will no longer be equivalent to 1 USD ( india back to the normal situation) ========================================================== In order to achieve power similar to USA ( 1 INR = 1 USD)-{ highly unlikely} Gradually: Indians will have to start using all the Indian products and start manufacturing all the necessity products in India itself. Imports should be minimal and exports should increase on a large scale. Many Indian startups should be on par with with world class firms. Entire country should be employed which gradually strengths Indian economy and above mentioned equation can be achieved."},{"prompt":"What do New Zealand people bring to the evacuation site after a tsunami warning?","completion":"Thank you for using your name.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","completion":"I’m not a parent (and at this point in life, never will be), but I have gotten in trouble in school before (not every day but more than a couple of times). Sitting in class will only encourage whoever is in the wrong to clam up and hide their behavior. Note I didn’t say your child. I agree with others, talk to your child, talk to the teacher, see if you can understand what’s going on. I think I’d go at it with a neutral attitude. Try to get both sides of the story. Maybe it’s a bully, maybe the teacher is the bully, maybe it’s a coolness factor (I think that was it for me; I was in a new school and amazing it didn’t happen more than it did, but I grew out of it. I still remember going camping with my dad, rest his soul, and having a few heart-to-heart talks before the new school year started)."},{"prompt":"Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?","completion":"I guess it’s called personal discipline."},{"prompt":"What is the easiest and best way to wake up in the morning?","completion":"Set an alarm, remove the option for a snooze button, get 7-8 hours of sleep, and once you wake up, drink something. I found that when I left Gatorade by my bedside at night, I would wake up, take a sip of the Gatorade and immediately feel SO much more awake. The main thing, however, is that you never give yourself permission to ever fall back asleep, even for 5 minutes. It will create a negative habit that reinforces you doing it all the time. Make the decision now to wake up and STAY UP whenever your alarm goes off. It has saved me more times than I can count."},{"prompt":"Why have there been so few images been released from the James Web Space Telescope?

Before then, men just basically trimmed as shaving was a real chore with a knife. Then during the world wars, being clean shaven was required to serve, and all those millions of men came home indoctrinated into needing to keep clean shaven. And passed that down to their sons. When I was in the 70s, I grew my first beard and few guys had them. I had many people, some strangers, tell me “You need to shave that off” like they have any say over me and my appearance. Today no one does that; most males in the US have some sort of facial hair it seems. But if I look at old photos of my grandfathers and great uncles around early 1900s, (my grandparents were all born in the 1880s) they all had beards.

By the way Aristotle was a Macedonian too, who had made a great reputation as a teacher in Nationalistic Athens(That’s the Reason Philip had chosen him as his son’s teacher) and is the most complicated in writting style along with Plato. Still the best philologists aren’t 100% sure what he is really talking about, in many chapters of his books. P.S. A Correction. Myrtine-Olympias wasn’t speaking Hepeirotiken Dialect.

Jim Jordan (GOP) said that it’s the President’s call to use his private lawyer as the point man for foreign policy instead of a duly appointed cabinet official. Is he correct?","completion":"There are many ways of negotiating anything. There are often informal discussions about having a discussion. Informal discussions cover the widest range of topics so that when an advance is made to holding formal discussions much of the chaff has been removed from the wheat. This saves time and effort. In the original transcript which was released Trump made it clear that he trusted Mr Giuliani as his lawyer and a person that was generally knowledgeable. Nothing more, not a diplomat or as anyone with plenipotentiary powers to negotiate anything. He is just someone Trump trusted to carry a message. The classic case of informal discussion. Trump obviously did not trust Obama’s choice for an ambassador and by that time she was out of the picture in any event.

For the Partial, if they're Amillenial (they believe the “millennium” in Revelation 20 is spiritual and typically started with the atonement on the cross or Pentecost I guess and is current until Christ's second physical “coming”) then they could have an optimistic view of a degree of gospel transformation of the world (maybe a “falling off\\" before Christ's coming) or think that increase of good, gospel-way, and bad is kind of even keel in balance. Then, Christ's second coming, judgment, and a new heaven and earth and physical resurrection bodies dwelling on earth with nothing bad on earth for those justified. If they're Postmillenial, then again, different flavours, but that we'd be in a millennium at some point or else now with more literal import now because of the spiritual, particularly what was established in AD70 with the end of the Old Covenant, the establishment of the New covenantally, Christ's spiritual coming in judgment and salvation being past (what transpired complete by AD70 being held in higher regard and understanding, spiritually). For them, the millennium could last for thousands of years, will see a very optimistic transformation of all structures in the world over time (some are gospel-centred in a spiritual sense and others have unfortunately been legalistic and social), maybe something of a falling off at the end just before Christ's second physical coming, and then the same as the amil. Sometimes with amils, but usually with Post-mils, a mass salvation of a literal Israel/Jewish people through coming to faith in Christ and the atonement features, too, just before Christ's “second\\" physical coming. Of course, every professing Christian is at least a Partial Preterist in some sense, as everyone believes Christ's death and resurrection and the giving of the Spirit at Pentecost fulfilled at least some of the eschatological promises already, but typically the aforementioned kind of covers Partial Preterism per se..apart from “Historic Premillenialists” (there are probably very few with this view today), who believe in a literal thousand year reign of glory in some “spiritualized geocentric sense” from a literal Jerusalem on earth prior Christ's second physical coming in glory, but are fundamentally distinguished from Dispensational Premillenialists in that the Historic have Israel (as well, a literal Israel, modern day Jews) being saved by being added to the church via the gospel, not having any other inheritance but as is found in the church through Christ. Other Premils, not so - they really chop things up and have two peoples, covenants, etc, and lots of brackets to that flow of God's purpose and plan in history, because they don't have a single united redemptive inheritance, history and thus gospel, ultimately. But they wouldn't be called or typically call themselves Preterists of any sort. As to “Full Preterists”, or some form of “covenant eschatology” believers like me, it would depend. There are often with these things something of a spectrum of views and some that I would distance myself from, too, at points. Such as the view that fails to comprehend the physical within the scope of spiritual resurrection. For my part, as with many, understanding that eschatology is the establishment of gospel promise and leaves behind it a “redemptive history\\", and the gospel is none other than the gift of Christ's finished righteousness reckoned as our own forever (post final judgment) reconciled to God and having resurrected us from the curse of the fall to all the grace of this “kingdom\\" in God's full favour, then blessing isn't over, it's truly begun in the full, kingdom sense, upon eschatological fulfilment. Like the strong amil and post-mil have understood, “fulfilment\\" with respect to “covenant” is about “spiritual inheritance obtained\\" etc. To use the biblical motif of marriage to describe it, as the bible does, after the cross/Pentecost there was a “now-not yet\\" with regards fulfilment and inheritance: like an “espousal”/engagement and then a “wedding day” whereupon the fullness was entered in upon spiritually. Per the ancient Hebrew and biblical concept, the “espoused\\" bride and husband were as-if married already in the sense that engagement had a very strong sense of “inheritance of future inheritance” that would be “consummated\\" in that public wedding day marking “dwelling together\\" joint-heirs of “the grace of life\\". Well, this is the same idea spiritually. Only the gift of post-Judgment justification and the kingdom of that fellowship and all its graces isn't any longer “not yet\\" to us. (Every other position previously mentioned says fundamentally, we're still in that New Testament “now-not yet\\", a “Bride-to-be\\"..even though some Post-mils have said, somewhat inconsistently with the “not yet\\" of their position, that the “marriage day\\" is past). But it's now in “Full Preterism” or a “Covenant Eschatology”. Yet, just as when a man and woman marry, the blessing doesn't become passive because fulfilled, realized on that day, but begun as active in the fully “mature\\" sense of their relationship, so too spiritually. So there's ongoing fellowship with God in all the blessings of spiritual resurrection through justification, concerning all of our God-given humanity once saved, having received his justification. As people truly “come of age\\" in the blessedness, rather than children waiting upon it. The kingdom has come on earth in a mature sense in those in Christ and thereby everyone else, just as Christ has already entered his gospel kingdom, delivered it up thus complete unto, with, His Father, having put all his and his Bride's enemies under his feet spiritually, and so there are ongoing happy, manifest consequences of the now direct inheritance. As to prophetic outlook on the world from where we now stand in this “New covenant age\\" post AD70 (the Old Testament and the New anticipated the consummation, the full establishment spiritually of the New Covenant upon the sign of the destruction of the Old's temple at a literal Jerusalem within such a time frame, which marked the disappearing of the old age and the dawning of the new in Christ) of course one couldn't say there are more specific prophecies left. But with the general tenor and intent of the gospel which is, as I say, far from finished, but rather “matured\\" in terms of “where we're at in state of blessing come\\", and with ongoing consequences in fruit for those in Christ, salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ for the world, and, as I would say, a hopeful view on the gospel transformation of the whole world over time, in the widest sense, accordingly. Not because we're still in the millennium or because there's more saving work to be brought by Christ “redemptive-historically”, “eschatologically”, “prophetically”, but because there is most definitely the greater manifestation of his gospel glory and finished work in fellowship with God now “dwelling with us\\" spiritually in Christ, on earth as it is heaven. So for my part, with that logical priority sketched, I do have a certain gospel hope that you could say looks like a “post-mil\\" one in one sense, albeit the spiritual gospel sort, but because of the kingdom of resurrection from the Adamic curse already come, “marriage” already here in Christ, not prospectively ahead. And therefore, a “filling up of what's been fulfilled\\". But, other Preterists would probably consider things more like, perhaps you could say, an “everlasting amil\\" outlook on earth, and point to the end of Revelation (and Isaiah 65, 66, from whence comes the “new [covenant] heavens and earth language\\" where there's the kingdom come on earth, and an “outside the kingdom\\" contemporaneously as “last look\\" of eschatology - Old and New Testament the same theme). Of course I agree that's what things look like by definition upon “marriage day\\", and that by no means are all saved because some are, but I would say they're a bit too hung up on that one day in that regard, over the spirit of what has begun on that one day in Christ, and the wider and eternal ramifications. No, I'm not a Universalist, but I do (somewhat tentatively, yes) suggest an ongoing transformation of the whole physical world over time according to gospel benefit in Christ through faith in repentance, according with the spiritual, with the Bride of Christ right at the heart of that, and greater “common graces”, accordingly, not least with time. This isn't to speak of the rate of transformation having to be constant etc, nor that great sin and evil can't happen, or things like the world wars in the last 100 years, or that people have been made of fundamental new, good nature prior to new birth, justification, salvation. No. But it is to suggest that, Christ is sovereign, Satan is no longer “the god of this age”, and Christ has fulfilled his gospel promises such that God would shed forth his kingdom graces and we'd enjoy him and them in living fellowship accordingly, forever. Of course, I do believe in a heaven, and I do believe that's when we experience the fullness we already have in perfect fullness. But also, that there's more on earth now and for the earth now than is often believed, even in the professing and even actual “church\\"/justified peeps, because we're not properly waiting on “God’s rest\\", his kingdom, in the ultimate spiritual sense anymore. Thus, we can put down a “deferred hope that makes the heart sick\\" the more we dwell on it, for the faith of a realized “life and life abundantly”, and according hopes. Physically, too, etc..with a spiritual (and yes, consequently, a true practical), rather than “what appears\\" focus and logical priority to it all."},{"prompt":"w hard is it to trace a VPN?","completion":"It can be traced to the VPN provider and from there to you, but only by those who are allowed to do that (official government organisations) or by hackers, if the VPN servers are not secure."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"For my opinion I think that fiverr is the best option for anyone, because it is free and have a lot of client around the world, there are more than 60 Millions visitors for fiverr, and it offers a lot of methods of payment ,frankly it is the best one this is the link to sign up and make your first dollars.

We put them down once it became obvious we had to, but at the same time I wish to this day that I waited longer for each one, and cried for hours and days afterward for each one.

[LINKED_TEXT: TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF EXAMS] [URL: https://www.dumpsworld.com/aws-certified-developer-simulation-questions.html] As human beings we face our first tests at a very young age. Tasks like singing a song in front of relatives, performing the new dance manoeuvre in front of Mummy and Daddy and simple arithmetic and spelling tests are examples of early tests. Some children thrive on showing everyone how good they are and as a consequence grow older with a positive association to tests and exams. Others feel embarrassment, perhaps are ridiculed and end up with a negative association to tests. From the associations formed with early tests, we create generalisations that either support us in exam conditions or bring us out in a cold sweat. We create mental filters that mediate our experience, so in the present day state we run mental programmes as a result of the filtering of internal and external stimuli. The output will be exam anxiety or exam confidence (or perhaps somewhere in the middle) depending on the individual. Generally, anxiety and studying for exams do not go well together. However, according to Csikszentmihalyi (1990) a low level of anxiety, combined with focus and heightened awareness are components of a ‘flow’ state. However high levels of anxiety while revising or taking the test itself severely limits recall and flow of information I would suggest an overall strategy for passing exams that includes being aware of the bigger goal, visualising success, creating an optimal learning state, planning study and being a smart reviser.

Here are 11 points on how, in my opinion, to make the most of it: “Your time spent in a fraternity basement is not time wasted” - Charles Wheelan. Obviously this point is broader than just frat basements. I’m referring to time spent at club events in Hart House or playing soccer games at Queens Park with friends. Even though there will always be work to be done, make sure you allocate time for having fun, making relationships, and going on a few dates here and there. This is the time to make life long friends and get experience dealing with people in various situations. Relationships are all that matter in this life, so prioritize accordingly. I should mention in parallel to this that alcohol & drug abuse is one of the leading factors that causes depression, so I’m advocating for the comraderie that these activities bring about and not necessarily the libations.Attend every lecture, but don’t take notes. Now this is a contrarian piece of advice, as I imagine lots of people will disagree with me but let me ask you this, do you take notes when a friend tells you a story? Probably not. But you can still recall the details of their story, right? That’s how I treated lectures. The guy or gal lecturing is simply telling you a 2 hr long story. Just listen attentively for the entire time. Additionally, most profs post lectures online so you can always refer to those.CGPA matters the most, so if you happen to be failing a class drop it immediately. Don’t risk it if your already failing a class. Chances are it will only get harder as the class progresses so no need prolong your suffering. This will also save you from having a failing grade on your transcript, which is extremely hard to make up thereafter. You can always re-take the class in the following semester or over the summer.Use the UofT brand to your advantage. You pay thousands of dollars to be there, not to mention that you worked hard to get admission. It’s one of the best academic brands in North America. Milk this opportunity as much as you can and start ASAP. Send emails to alumni who work in the industries you may wish to join after graduation. Get coffees with them. Ask a lot of questions. Do the same with professors, administrators, executives, etc. The more people you know, the more avenues you can exploit to get a job.Go to the dedicated UofT dentist. Some folks don’t realize that UofT includes the price of their comprehenisve dental plan into tuition charges. Even if your teeth are fine, book a cleaning/check-up anyway. You already paid for it.Live in dorms for at least two years. There is no better place to make great friends than in your dorm or residence. I recommend at least two years in a residence, as a result.Budget. This doesn’t mean just monetarily, although that is obviously imperative. I also mean this with your time. The thing with university vs. High school is that, in university, no one is watching you. Go to class, don’t go to class. No one cares. Study or don’t study. No one cares. Ran out of time for assignments submission? No one cares about your excuses (unless you have prior authorization, of course). You are responsible for your own time. No one will be watching what you do, or scolding you for not doing things. Your finally your own boss, but that has its down sides.Exploit resources on and off campus. There is lots of help for students at UofT. Get to know a person in your registrar office, and go to them regularly for help/planning. Familiarize yourself with the placement office and use them to your advantage throughout your university career. They will help you create a good resume, improve your interview skills, and land a job post graduation. Off campus, go to various events on Meetup dot com or through Eventbrite and broadcast your occupation as a student looking for interesting opportunities off campus. People look for this type of initiative. Furthermore, Toronto is a major city…you never know who you may meet or what doors you may open.Get to know at least three profs personally. They are good resources for advice and they are well connected. Also, if you plan on doing a masters, you need a recommendation from a few of them. That will be much easier if you developed a good relationship with them, early on.If you can afford it, take advantage of summer abroad programs. Although I was never able to, these programs are pretty badass. You can go anywhere in the world and live there for 6 weeks with your classmates. Traveling is a great way to broaden your perspective and gain worldly knowledge that could stack your resume. You get a credit for doing it too.Finally, don’t take it all too seriously. Even though you will be dealing with a lot more “adult” stuff than you did in high school, don’t forget that your still a kid. In these types of premier institutions there is a lot of pressure and some people may seem as though they have everything figured out. This can be intimidating, but don’t let these people fool you. We are all unsure and confused, just some of us are better at hiding it. You have a lot of time to figure things out, so don’t put unnecessary pressure on yourself. Just do what your suppose to do, when your suppose to do it, and fortune will bow to your efforts."},{"prompt":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","completion":"Project Gutenberg.

If the situation becomes dire enough, first the people of the countryside will be allowed to starve or entirely fend for themselves, and then the common people of the open cities will be allowed to starve. All remaining resources will be focused on the central government, the elites in their gated communities in the open cities, the closed technical research and manufacturing cities, and the military bases. So you may be asking, what is a closed city? , Russia is an authoritarian country with a different way of thinking compared to democratic countries. Rather than the government existing to serve the people, the people serve the government, and more specifically a ruling party, that is effectively acting as a monarchy established by overthrowing the previous rulers. Any resemblance to democratic countries is just window dressing at best, or done in open mockery and defiance of how the rest of the world does things. When the Russian government wants to do something, it takes over a region of its rural countryside away from the general population, builds a strong, tall fence around it to keep out the locals, and pours all its money and resources into building up technical knowledge and expertise, with the goal of accomplishing a specific function. A closed city is very similar to what the rest of the democratic world would call a military base, and in Russia that is often the focus of interest for their closed cities, such as weapons development or manufacturing. But the people who live in the closed city are mainly not soldiers, and there isn’t as much saluting and goose-stepping as compared to a military base. The people allowed to live in the closed city by the government are generally the most intelligent, the most wealthy, or the most politically well-connected. These people know the privileges given to them, and they are careful to stay in the good graces of their central government benefactor. , Meanwhile the people in the countryside do not have access and may not be allowed to know what is going on inside the walled city. They live a subsistence level existence, just getting by, and the government does as little as it can to provide for their needs. It is common for the people in the countryside to have no running water in their homes and to still be using pit toilets outdoors rather than plumbing and septic systems. They may have to grow most of their own food and keep some animals for livestock to feed them, when the government won’t. When Russia is at war, the people in the countryside are going to suffer first from the lack of resources. The people in the closed cities will generally remain unaffected by resource shortages for a long time. As far as the Russian government is concerned, the general population of the countryside are expendable, a resource to be exploited, like coal or lumber or anything else. If they need to be sacrificed to accomplish the goals of the ruling party, that is fine. Just so long as the closed cities get the resources they need. , The situation is more complicated in open cities like Moscow, where this divide between strong government control is not so clearly defined. The general population mixes with the elites, who may have their own gated community within the larger city, but the elites still need to come out and mingle with the commoners for access to city services. And there is the problem of common people in the open cities, who think they have more rights than the central government allows them to have. This is why there tends to be more conflict in the major population centers, because the central government can’t rule with an iron fist as easily as it can in the closed cities. But the government does still have ultimate control over the commoners in open cities since those people don’t have access to farmland for subsistence living without government involvement. If necessary the troublemaking commoners can be starved out of the open cities. , You may have heard in the news about brain drain in Russia shortly after the war started, with people leaving Russia to avoid conscription. These are primarily the more wealthy commoners, hangers-on and foreigners living in the open cities that don’t directly serve the central government. The Russian government is likely happy to see these people leave as they are just troublemakers anyway, with their imaginary ideas of free speech or gender deviancy or race equivalence, brought in from other parts of the world. The actual elites in the gated communities of open cities and in the closed technical cities who are loyal to the government meanwhile are not going to leave, because they are exempt from conscription and austerity. , Nationwide facilities such as electric power or roads are similarly managed. There will be well-maintained huge-capacity power transmission lines and concrete-paved 4-lane highway infrastructure in place for linking the closed cities and military bases, while the commoners in the rest of the countryside may be getting by on severely rutted and potholed dirt tracks. These intercity services may be for similarly gated/fenced exclusive use by the elites, or somewhat open access for the commoners, with the understanding that the commoners must get the hell out of the way when the official designated users of those services are coming through and need them. , References: [LINKED_TEXT: Closed city - WikipediaSettlements requiring authorization to visit Central entry checkpoint to the closed city of Seversk , Tomsk Oblast , Russia A closed city or closed town is a settlement where travel or residency restrictions are applied so that specific authorization is required to visit or remain overnight.

[ citation needed ] There may also be a wider variety of permanent residents, including close family members of workers or trusted traders who are not directly connected with clandestine purposes. Many closed cities existed in the Soviet Union from the mid-1940s until its dissolution in 1991 . [1] After 1991, a number of them still existed in the CIS countries, especially in Russia. In modern Russia, such places are officially known as \\"closed administrative-territorial formations\\" ( закрытые административно-территориальные образования , zakrytye administrativno-territorial'nye obrazovaniya , or ЗАТО ZATO for short). Structure and operations [ edit ] A checkpoint in the closed city of Zheleznogorsk , in Krasnoyarsk Krai , Russia Sometimes closed cities may only be represented on classified maps that are not available to the general public. [1] In some cases there may be no road signs or directions to closed cities, and they are usually omitted from railroad time tables and bus routes. Sometimes closed cities may be indicated obliquely as a nearby insignificant village, with the name of the stop serving the closed city made equivocal or misleading. For mail delivery, a closed city is usually named as the nearest large city and a special postcode, for example, Arzamas‑16, Chelyabinsk‑65. The actual settlement can be rather distant from its namesakes; for instance, Sarov , designated Arzamas-16, is in the federal republic of Mordovia , whereas Arzamas is in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) away). People not living in a closed city were subject to document checks and security checkpoints , and explicit permission was required for them to visit. [2] To relocate to a closed city, one would need security clearance by the organization running it, such as the KGB in Soviet closed cities. Closed cities were sometimes guarded by a security perimeter with barbed wire and towers . The very fact of such a city's existence was often classified, and residents were expected not to divulge their place of residence to outsiders. This lack of freedom was often compensated by better housing conditions and a better choice of goods in retail trade than elsewhere in the country. [1] Also, in the Soviet Union, people working with classified information received a salary bonus .

The name kamikaze is somewhat metaphorical and rooted in Japanese history. Threatened with Chinese-Mongol invasion twice in the late 1200’s by Kublai Khan, Japan was saved partially by typhoons that conveniently came along with rather nice timing. These were known a ‘mana winds’, kaze ‘wind’ and kami ‘mana’, a kind of supernatural power, sometimes a little misleadingly rendered into English as “divine”. So the Special Attack Squadrons were to be a man made ‘mana wind’, or kamikaze that would be an airborne timely salvation for Japan. It didn’t work the way the Japanese command hoped or anticipated, but in a way it did. It was an added consideration among the Western Allies and particularly the American high command in counting the potential cost for an invasion of the Home Islands. And ultimately when the Japanese offered to surrender, it was with the provision that the Heavenly Sovereign, or Tenno, remain on the Chrysanthemum Throne. In other words, an unconditional surrender with a condition. President Truman decided that that was in the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and was sufficiently unconditional. So the Emperor remained and the country got run for a while by the Shogun MacArthur. Hardly a new thing in Japanese history and polity. And while in the US Constitution the first article is about the Congress, in the Japanese Constitution to this day, the Imperial Year 2681, the first article is Tenno ‘the Emperor’. i.e. the ‘Heaven[ly] Sovereign’."},{"prompt":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

But, I disagree that a PhD in security means that you will need to be limited to cryptography and math. You can do interdisciplinary style PhDs with a security angle that will have great applicability beyond academia: embedded security with a hardware design angle and side channel, securing AI (a key issue raised by Tesla for example), develop new ways to analyze systems for exploitability (major emerging problem with all the interconnected systems/IoT), program analysis for vulnerability /exploitability mitigation (how do you know when a complex system is interacting whether it is potentially an exploit attempt), secure processors with post von Neumann designs, post quantum security (not breakable with quantum computing), using emerging technology to enhance how security is done from physical unary functions (PUF) to technologies that make it hard to reverse engineer a system, etc. These are just some examples from the top of my head that someone who starts out today could do. A PhD will give you an education (assuming you work with a world-leading advisor) that will benefit you for a lifetime. If you join a company in cyber security you will be dealing with every day security challenges and will be competing with others without an intellectual edge so to speak. Nothing wrong with it if you end up with the right organization with key experts and you can still continue to learn, but chances are that your perspective will become much more limited."},{"prompt":"What is chutiya in Hindi?","completion":"It is a vulgar word.

You will hear almost no honks while in Bhutan.If you are Indian, Try to walk on footpaths and use zebra crossings while on road. They are strictly used in Bhutan.Most of the people in Bhutan speak in majorly in English or Hindi. They may not be fluent but still they can manage very well.If the trip is short , Firstly try to visit Thimphu and Paro. they are major cities of Bhutan and cover most of the tourist places.

It's challenging to definitively say who the \\"most powerful\\" warrior is, as the epic often highlights the diverse abilities of different characters. Let's take a closer look at a few notable warriors: Bhishma: Bhishma Pitamaha was a highly skilled and mighty warrior. He had the boon of choosing his time of death and was virtually invincible until he chose to lay down his weapons.Arjuna: Arjuna, the third Pandava prince, was renowned for his exceptional archery skills, deep devotion, and righteousness. He was trained by Lord Krishna himself and played a pivotal role in the Kurukshetra war.Karna: Karna possessed immense strength and formidable skills. He was known for his generosity and loyalty. Despite being on the Kaurava side, his skills were considered on par with the best warriors.Dronacharya: Dronacharya was a skilled warrior and a renowned teacher. He trained both the Kauravas and Pandavas in military arts and was a formidable force on the battlefield.Krishna: While Krishna primarily played the role of a strategist and charioteer for Arjuna, he possessed divine powers and was not to be underestimated. It's important to note that the Mahabharata presents these characters in complex ways, showcasing their strengths, weaknesses, and moral dilemmas. Each warrior had their moments of prowess and challenges. Ultimately, the epic emphasizes the interplay of fate, destiny, and individual choices, rather than singling out a single \\"most powerful\\" warrior. Curious to learn more?

Here are some key principles that can contribute to successful sports betting: Knowledge and Research: A solid understanding of the sport, teams, players, and relevant statistics is crucial. Stay updated on current news, injuries, team form, and other factors that can impact the outcome of a match. Conduct thorough research and analysis before placing your bets.Bankroll Management: Managing your bankroll effectively is vital for long-term success. Set a budget for your betting activities and avoid betting more than you can afford to lose. Use proper staking strategies, such as flat betting or proportional betting, to protect your bankroll and minimize risks.Value Betting: Look for value in the betting markets. Value betting involves identifying odds that are higher than the true probability of an event occurring. This requires assessing the odds offered by bookmakers and comparing them to your own estimations of the likelihood of an outcome. If you consistently find value bets, it can lead to long-term profitability.Discipline and Emotional Control: Successful sports bettors exhibit discipline and emotional control. Avoid impulsive betting decisions based on emotions or biases. Stick to your strategies and avoid chasing losses. Accept that losses are part of the game, and don't let them negatively impact your decision-making.Specialization and Focus: Consider specializing in specific sports, leagues, or markets. By focusing your knowledge and expertise on a particular area, you can gain an advantage over more generalized bettors. Develop an edge by becoming an expert in your chosen niche.Record Keeping and Analysis: Keep a detailed record of your bets, including the types of bets, stakes, odds, and outcomes. Regularly analyze your betting performance to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This can help you refine your strategies over time and learn from past mistakes.Continuous Learning: The world of sports betting is ever-evolving. Stay curious, adapt to changes, and continuously learn from experienced bettors and industry resources. Engage in forums, follow expert analysis, and stay up-to-date with trends and developments in the sports betting community. Remember, sports betting involves an element of chance, and there are no guarantees of success. It's important to approach it with a responsible and realistic mindset. Practice good bankroll management, make informed decisions based on research and analysis, and continuously strive to improve your skills and knowledge as a sports bettor.

The caller ID function immediately flashes the number but most callers admit they dialed it accidentally. Another caller’s toddler would keep dialing the helpline. Malaysia has a law for punishing people who make silent calls to police helplines. But in India, we don’t, so we can only warn the caller. Helpline operators are largely female, and when a blank call is received, there is the concern if someone is trying to act fresh. In Malaysia, offenders are charged under the Communication and Multimedia Act, and if found guilty, can be fined RM50,000 (Rs 7.46 lakh approximately) or jailed for up to a year or both. Fifty operators man the helpline in two eight-hour shifts. We used to have 20 operators initially. In the future, we would have to expand. Most operators come from the state’s interiors. They grapple with problems of language and limited knowledge of Mumbai’s topography.The helpline maintains a database of callers with names. From time-to-time, the database is updated with numbers acquired from telecom service-providers. We have set up new software which traces the location of each individual who dials 100 and plots it on a map. The project is being tested. It will weed out hoax-callers. The time is taken for responding to callers in distress, once they have spoken to an operator, has come down from 10 minutes to around eight. The objective is to reduce it to six minutes. Beat marshals are being trained and more vehicles provided to police stations to achieve this. Hard-pressed to provide the prompt response in emergency situations, police feels blank calls are a big problem being faced by the department. Twenty seconds are wasted in attending to one blank call on an average. At times, blocking such caller’s numbers can be the solution, but due to easy availability of SIM cards, the troublemakers call from new numbers.

When Catherine de’ Medici moved to Paris to live with her new husband, she brought a virtual armada of ships with her. 2 of the ships just carried her dresses and other clothing. Other ships carried her vast compliment of servants, including her chefs. It was those Italian chefs that taught the French how to cook, because after a dinner at Versailles every French noble and their wealthier patrons all sent their own cooks to the royal palace to learn from Catherine's Italian chefs.

He continues on and states that he believes Kanan sent him there to save him. Ezra was about to put his hand into the portal when Ahsoka abruptly grabs him and tries to reason with him. She says: Ezra, Kanan gave his life so that you could live. If he is taken out of this moment, you all die. Ezra then says: You don’t understand what you’re asking me to do. Ahsoka replies with: Yes, I do. You can’t save your master…. and… I can’t save mine. I’m asking you…. to let go. [Ezra watches Kanan’s sacrifice in the portal and puts his hand down.] [Ahsoka]: I’m sorry Ezra, but you must see. Kanan found the moment when he was needed the most…. and he did what he had to do…. for everyone…. So, as you can see, it wasn’t about whether or not Ezra could’ve saved Kanan. He could’ve totally done so… but instead, he didn’t let his emotions get to him. He accepted the truth. He accepted Kanan’s sacrifice for him, for his family, and for the Rebellion. At this point, there was nothing more Ezra could’ve done. After realizing what Kanan did and the impact of his sacrifice, Ezra officially let his emotions go. He said goodbye one last time…………… Time to cry.😭😭😭"},{"prompt":"Are there any real differences between covert narc discard and classic narc discard?

Narcissists need supply and they wouldn't discard you without a safety net.Devaluation is followed up by a discard, sometimes by lovebombing, when your replacement doesn't work out.

The narcissist will have moved on and be totally invested in the new partner.Long before you get discarded, the narcissist will start smearing you behind your back.

And smearing is how they make sure noone believes you.Your discard is actually planned by the narcissist. It's not done on a whim.You're discarded because the narcissist thinks that this new person is better than you.

Why or why not?","completion":"No way at all. Though I'm a right wing and BJP supporter, there's no way Arnab goswami is or ever can be more deserving than Ravish Kumar for any journalism award. Though Ravish Kumar is politically biased towards left and I don't like his political bias, his series on job and education crisis was very good and these things must be highlighted into mainstream media and news debates instead of daily debates on useless and communal matters which most of the media houses are doing now.Ravish kumar keeps highlighting government failures and keeps questioning the government on important issues likes jobs, education, infrastructure, law & order which are the basic ethics of journalism. These issues must be highlighted and debated instead of daily debates on communal matters with a bunch of clowns shouting at each other having no debating standards.Though both of them didn't let the person of opposite ideology enough many times, but Ravish kumar's way of presenting the news and organising the debates is far better than Arman's. At least it is not annoying with all that unnecessary shouting as Arnab's.Also, Arnab goswami rarely organise debates and talks about relevant issues like jobs and economy compared to Ravish kumar. Arnab goswami's over nationalism and shouting style made him very popular in beginning, but now is very annoying as hell. I also like Sudhir Chaudhary and his show DNA a lot but he doesn't do debates and much ground level journalism compared to Ravish Kumar. So, considering all these factors, I think Ravish kumar is among the best we have for any kind of journalism related award."},{"prompt":"a video game ever predicted the future?","completion":"There a few but I will write my favourite!

Anyone who uses longer words to describe the Federation, or tries to paint it as any more complicated than that, is giving them way too much credit. That said, I wish people would be a little smarter when watching this movie, because its message is not “The Federation is bad.” The message is that violence is bad, period. The film is genius in that it gives the audience zero reliable information to work with. The joke then becomes the audience, who proceed to make assumptions and express which side is “right” or “wrong” … based on nothing but their own biases. Do you believe that the Mormon settlers in the Quarantine Zone fired the first shots? That's nice, but you don't know. Your pretense to absolute knowledge has been noted. Do you believe that the Mormon settlers deserved to die because they settled in “bug territory,” and the bugs were “defending their territory\\"? Congratulations, you're no different from the Federation, who also assume control over territory and punish those who question it. Do you believe the bug meteorite that wiped out Buenos Aires was a false flag, because there's no way it could have traveled across the galaxy so quickly? Well, the Federation warships crossed the galaxy that quickly. Who's to say the “meteorites” — which, mind you, are being shot out of bugs' asses — aren't biomechanical in nature, and equipped with similar technology to the warships'? You can't know, because this is a movie. But your pretense to absolute knowledge has been noted. There are lots of motivations for pretending to have knowledge you don't have. None is good. The popular response to this movie is to presume that, because Federation news is presented in the style that screams “propaganda,” it must be false. But this is just as foolish as viewing “normal\\" news and assuming that it's true because it doesn't look like obvious propaganda. It is warm and comfortable to be able to call the Federation the bad guy in this conflict. Are they evil, period? Yes. They give us more than enough information to know that. Do they deserve to be deleted, like a bad disease? Yep. But are they actually the aggressors in the conflict with the bugs? We can't know. Are they Nazis? If military service were mandatory, they would deserve that title, yes. The fact that Federal military service is not mandatory, however, makes the Nazi comparison much more difficult. In fact, all else considered, that reduces their scariness close to the level of modern, real-world governments — and that's what no one wants to talk about. The Federation steals your freedom upon birth and only gives it back to you if you become a citizen. Sound familiar? That is exactly what modern governments do: “Were you born somewhere else? Jump through our hoops to acquire citizenship, a.k.a. permission to exist here. Do you want to live, produce, trade? You're free to do that, as long as you do it exactly how we say.” We know an awful lot about how real-world governments control people, but most of what we “know\\" about the Federation we don't actually know. We are manipulated into assuming it based on the Riefenstahl style of their newsreels, a style that rings our “Nazi\\" Pavlov bell. The simple fact is that we don't know whether the Federation is significantly worse than modern governments, and that should be what people talk about. But it's easier to say “Federation bad!” because it tells you the comforting story that your brand of government must be better — which is not necessarily true at all."},{"prompt":"What is a good ham radio to get for a beginner?

This Myth this is not entirely true. But the research has shown that we can use max 10–20% of our brain. Some researchers have estimated that more than 60 percent of the brain consists of \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons that have no apparent purpose and seem unresponsive to common stimuli. If we take human evolution into accounts, our develop this magnificent ability of reasoning merely 70 thousand years ago. Considering nearly 2.5 million years of human evolution 70k is very very small fraction. That means nearly 2.5 million years we were just like other animals with limited brain capacity & thinking ability. Modern humans sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimetres. brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, & encompasses 1200–1400 CC area. For using our 100% of our brain it size also need to expand which will make our head very large, which will be not supported by our rest of body due to inappropriate brain to body proportion. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, imagine we started to use 100% of brain power, than we have to provide constant food supply to keep it working otherwise it will just absorb all the energy of body and create condition of death oftenly, because we can't feed our body every seconds of time. 100% brain uses will need so much nutrients, blood supply, oxygen etc that it will create deficit in rest of body & start to absorb as much as it can from rest of body which will eventually kill us. So it's neither good nor possible to use 100% of brain. But let's imagine we have started to use 100% without any side effects or death. Than we will be able to create so many things, our Civilization will become too much advance in terms of Science, religion, psychology and so on. We might be able to develop some alien technologies, like one you have seen in movies etc But still we can't create energy because of universal law that energy neither be created nor be destroyed. So we might not be able to create something like entire separate human universe. So even we start to use 100% brain our options will be limited. No matter how much advanced you became you can never overtake universe or nature.

I love it because it is making it clearer abd more obilvious to me that I've been right in a big reason why a lot of people hate Dany. Which is because she had everything their fave needed to fight against the dead. A large ass army, 3 dragons(fire) and dragonglass. I hate this question because in showing me this, it has also shown me that i was right in that people just want Dany to be the means their fave gets what they need and then Dany herself can go f*** off. Now that she has come to the north, one dragon is dead and Jon is riding north, her army is now in formatioj and the battle is about to begin, then all the haters want dany to either ditch the battle effectively dashing her army to jon snow, or to kill some innocent northerner like lyanna or sansa, effectively alienatiolng herslef from the people who believe in her, or for Drogon to die. Leaving her in a position where Jon has the dragon and Dnay has nothing. You see what people don't want to admit is that it is not a coincidence that Dany had all the things needed to fight the dead. You don't give an antagonist all the things required to fight an even bigger bad. That's just not how it works. Dany obtained allbshe did for a reason.

His performances in films like the cult classic Maya Bazaar, Missyamma, Muthyala Muggu, Sankarabaranam and so on remain memorable to fans of cinema. Rama Lingaiah had four children - Allu Aravind, Surekha Konidela, Vasantha Lakshmi, and Nava Bharathi. While Vasantha and Bharathi chose to stay out of the limelight, Allu Aravind became one of Tollywood's most prominent film producers and distributors. He founded Geetha Arts in 1972, a production company which began with small budget films and grew to produce big blockbusters, including the Aamir Khan starrer Ghajini (Hindi). In 1980, Surekha married Konidela Siva Sankara Vara Prasad. For those who don't recognise the name, it belongs to Megastar Chiranjeevi, one of Telugu cinema's biggest superstars. She is the link between the Chiranjeevi and Allu families. Allu Aravind and his wife Nirmala have three children - Venkatesh, Arjun and Sirish. Allu Venkatesh and Allu Arjun made their acting debut in as child artistes in the 1985 film Vijetha, which starred their uncle Chiranjeevi in the lead role and was produced by their father Allu Aravind. While the film was the only one in which Venkatesh acted, Arjun went on to do several more. His younger brother, Allu Sirish, too, acts in south Indian films, his last release being 1971: Beyond Borders with Mohanlal. Chiranjeevi and Surekha also have three children - Ram Charan, Srija, Susmitha. Ram Charan made his acting debut in 2007 and is among the highest paid stars in Tollywood. He has acted in many blockbusters, including SS Rajamouli's Magadheera. Ram Charan also established a production house called Konidela Production Company which produced his father Chiranjeevi's 150th film, Khaidi No.150. His sibling Sushmita Konidela is an accomplished stylist and costume designer. She was behind Chiranjeevi's stylish look in Khaidi No.150 and several other films. The youngest sibling, Srija, gave plenty of fodder for gossip mills when she eloped with her college boyfriend Sirish Bharadwaj in 2007. However, the marriage did not last and the couple got divorced. She married Kalyan, an NRI, last year. Chiranjeevi's brothers, Pawan Kalyan and Nagendra Babu, are also actors. While Nagendra Babu mainly played supporting roles in films and currently appears in TV serials and shows, Pawan Kalyan commands a massive fan following and his followers consider his style and philosophy - dubbed 'Pawanism' - to be almost like a religion! He entered politics in 2014 by founding the Jana Sena Party. Pawan Kalyan has married thrice - to Nandini from 1997 to 2007, to Renu Desai from 2009 to 2012 and to Anna Lezhneva since 2013. He has two children, Akira Nandan Konidela (born 2004) and Aadhya Konidela (born 2010), both with Renu Desai. Renu Desai made her directorial debut with the Marathi film Ishq Wala Love, that was later dubbed in Telugu and her son Akira Nandan Konidela played a cameo role in it. Nagendra Babu, who also owns a production company called Anjana Productions, has two children - Varun Tej Konidela and Niharika Konidela. While the hero of the recently released Fidaa, Varun Tej, is a relatively well-established actor in Tollywood, his sister, Niharika Konidela, is a television anchor and actor. Niharika also owns the production house Pink Elephant Pictures. Akkineni-Daggubati family The Akkineni family came into prominence with the prolific Nageswara Rao (ANR), an actor and producer. He was one of Tollywood's most respected personalities. He was also the recipient of the prestigious Dada Saheb Phalke award and was awarded the Padma Vibushan. In 1975, ANR founded the legendary Annapurna Studios, which was named after his wife. He'd go on to establish the Annapurna International School of Film and Media (AISFM) in 2011, three years before his death. ANR had five children -- Akkineni Nagarjuna, Akkineni Venkat Rathnam, Naga Susheela Akkineni, Saroja Akkineni, and Sathyavathi Akkineni Venkat, who is also a film producer, and Susheela, are directors at Annapurna Studios. Sathyavathi Akkineni would go on to marry film producer Surendra Yarlagadda. Nagarjuna, ANR's most famous son, became a huge star in the Telugu industry, acting in cult films like Siva. He's mostly known for his biographical films, especially Annamayya. In 1984, Nagarjuna married Lakshmi Daggubati, whose surname belongs to one of the most powerful families in Tollywood. The marriage, however, did not last. Nagarjuna and Lakshmi divorced in 1992. Both of them remarried - Nagarjuna to actor Amala and Lakshmi to Sharath Vijay Raghavan, a corporate executive. At the head of the Daggubati family was Padma Bushan recipient Ramanaidu, who founded Suresh Productions. The first film to come out under this banner was in 1964. Ramanaidu was married to Rajeswari and the couple had three children - Lakshmi, Suresh Babu, and Venkatesh. Venkatesh is a well-known actor in the Telugu industry and has had a long and successful career of over three decades. He also holds the distinction of winning the most number of Nandi Awards for Best Actor so far. Suresh Babu is the managing director of Suresh Productions. The third generation of the Akkineni-Daggubati family also features several prominent names. Image Courtesy: Facebook/Akkineni Nagarjuna From the Akkineni family, Nagarjuna's children, Naga Chaitanya (born to Lakshmi Daggubati), and Akhil Akkineni (born to Amala), are both actors. Naga Chaitanya will soon wed actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu. While Akhil has acted in a handful of films, Naga Chaitanya's career has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Satyavathi, Nagarjuna's sister, is married to film producer Surendra Yarlagadda. Their son, Sumanth, is an actor, producer and partner at Annapurna Studios. Their daughter Supriya Yarlagadda is an Executive Director with Annapurna Studios. Naga Susheela, another sister of Nagarjuna's, married Anumolu Sathyabushana Rao, the son of producer AV Subba Rao. Their son, Anumolu Sushanth, is an actor in Tollywood. From the Daggubati family, Suresh Babu's son, Rana Daggubati has made his own name in the industry, particularly with the Baahubali franchise in which he played the antagonist to critical acclaim. Image Courtesy: Facebook/Akkineni Nagarjuna Nandamuri Family Possibly Telugu cinema’s first superstar, NT Rama Rao acted in around 300 films over 33 years, before going on to set up the TDP and then become three-time Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Of all his roles, it was his portrayals of the deities Krishna and Rama in multiple films including in classic hits like Maya Bazaar and Shri Venkateshwara Mahatyam (1960) that created a mass aura around him. While much of his early career was devoted to playing mythological characters, NTR then moved onto playing the role of the heroic common man in films such as Devudu Chesina Manushulu, Driver Ramudu, Sardar Papa Rayudu and so on. In his final film before entering politics, Bobbilli Puli, NTR played an upright officer taking on a corrupt government. NTR’s younger brother Trivikram Rao was also a notable presence in Tollywood in the NTR years and after. He produced over 20 films, including some starring NTR like Justice Chowdhary. Trivikram was also credited with introducing director Puri Jagannath to the industry. With his first wife Basava Tarakam, NTR had eight sons and four daughters. Of these, Nandamuri Balakrishna, popularly known as Balayya, became the most successful on-screen, starring in over 100 movies. Some of his famous hits include Narasimha Naidu, Legend, Simha, Bhairava Dweepam, and Muddula Krishnayya. Despite having entered politics as a TDP MLA, Balakrishna continues a successful acting career, with his 100th film Gautamiputra Satakarni drawing both critical and popular acclaim. NTR’s fourth son, Nandamuri Harikrishna found some success in the film industry as a child artiste in the 1960s and 1970s in films like Shri Krishnavataram and Talla Pellama, and had some film appearances since the 1990s. NTR’s third son Saikrishna, who owned a theatre in Hyderabad, died in 2004 due to complications from diabetes. Two more sons Jayakrishna and Mohanakrishna are cinematographers, while one son Ramakrishna Jr is a film producer. One of NTR’s daughters Bhuvaneswari married N Chandrababu Naidu, who would eventually go onto toppling NTR to gain control of the TDP and become Chief Minister himself. Among the next generation of NTR’s family, Jr NTR, the son of Harikrishna has made the most significant mark on Tollywood. Rated among the top stars of Tollywood, Jr NTR has had a slew of successes such as Aadhi, Simhadri, Student No 1, Janata Garage and Nannaku Prematho. Harikrishna’s other son Kalyan Ram is an actor and producer. He has starred in films such as Athanokkade, Hare Ram, Pataas, and ISM. Kalyan Ram also owns a production house called NTR Arts and a visual effects company called Advitha Creative Studios. Harikrishna’s third son Janakiram was a film producer, but passed away in a road accident in 2014. NTR grandson Tarak Ratna, has been struggling to make his mark in the industry, and is best known for his award-winning negative role in the film Amaravathi. Chandrababu Naidu’s family too bears a connection with the film industry, through Nara Rohit, Naidu’s nephew. The alumnus of the New York Film Academy is an actor and a producer and has appeared in films like Baanam, Solo, Prathinidhi, Rowdy Fellow, Asura, and Jyo Achyutananda."},{"prompt":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","completion":"Body Mass Index (BMI) is a tool that medical practitioners and fitness experts use to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. It's essentially a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the following BMI categories for adults: Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9Obesity: BMI is 30 or more Obesity itself is further categorized into three classes: Class 1: BMI of 30 to 34.9Class 2: BMI of 35 to 39.9Class 3: BMI of 40 or more, often referred to as \\"morbidly obese\\" or \\"severely obese\\" Being morbidly obese affects individuals both physically and emotionally. Here's a detailed description: Due to the excessive weight, individuals may find it difficult to move around or perform regular activities. This might lead to a sedentary lifestyle, further worsening their health. Morbid obesity increases the risk of various health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, certain types of cancer, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. Studies suggest that morbid obesity can significantly reduce life expectancy due to the associated health risks. Many morbidly obese individuals struggle with self-esteem issues, often due to societal pressure and stereotypes about weight and appearance. These mental health conditions are more prevalent in people who are morbidly obese, partly due to societal prejudice, but also as a result of the physical discomfort and health concerns they may face. Weight stigma is a significant issue in many societies, and it can manifest in many ways, including workplace discrimination, unfair treatment in healthcare settings, and social exclusion. ⛔️⛔️ Bonus tips ⛔️⛔️ Tired of relentless battles against stubborn fat and draining fatigue?

So i basically wake up at 9.30 am approximately (as I'm a night owl ) and then I have my breakfast and rush to the bus stop for taking bus/auto ( I'm living in Technopolis Area, kolkata & it hardly take 15 min to reach college by bus/auto. I always prefer auto as it is convenient for me & it takes less time compare to bus ). After reach college I take lift for going to classes as our classes held in 3rd floor. After 2–3 hours of lectures I'm going to cafeteria with my other batch mates to have some lunch. After finishing lunch we have to go for lab works or some extra classes ( sometimes we are busy in doing Assignments ). Approx 5 pm our classes get over & we are so much tired. Then I'm searching for auto/bus with my friends to reach home ( I'm living in a flat with my friend). After taking 2 hours of nap, I'm feeling fresh to do college work, assignment or preparation for next day class. Around 9 pm I take dinner with my flat mates.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"I test between high 140s and low 150s, and for the purpose of this, I'm going to just assume that I am qualified enough to give my perspective at least. My perspective is a bit strange, actually. I come from a very intelligent family, where an IQ above 130 is the norm in a family of 5. My dad is a hardware architect for a billion-dollar chip manufacturing company, and my mom is a nuclear physicist. When you have a family like this, you actually don't feel smart at all. It wasn't until I began public school that I started to notice. And it was disappointing. People assumed me emotional, and sensitive, but really, I was depressed. I couldn't put it into words as a child, but something felt completely off and I felt totally alienated. Concepts that came naturally to me, and what I thought was common sense in every day life, seemed to be totally ignorant amongst the rest. I remember being in math class, and crying because the kids couldn't understand basic multiplication, and I felt like I was in a world of stupidity. Ive never once felt smart in my life. But I look at everyone else, and wonder, how on earth are you still alive? And without college, it's a struggle. Because nobody wants to believe you're just inherently smart. Nobody wants to believe you could possibly understand something without some figurehead granting you a title that allows you to think a certain way and have good ideas. Until you make it far in business, you'll be frustrated beyond frustrated for your incompetent bosses. You'll watch as your stupid co workers become successful, while you have to just wait for your “dues to be paid\\". It's miserable, until you make it. And then it's heaven on earth once you do, if you do. Many intelligent people are not afforded social skills to match, and often never end up successful.

Thermal conductivity says how much thermal energy will permeate a material in a unit amount of time, whereas thermal diffusivity says how much area a unit of energy will permeate in a unit amount of time. If not, what am I missing?","completion":"The equation defining thermal conductivity is as follows: [math]q = kappa nabla T[/math] This is a simplified form of Fourier’s law of heat conduction which is valid in an isotropic medium. In general the heat conductivity [math]kappa[/math] is described by a tensor. The equation relates the flux of heat [math]q[/math] through some material instantaneously to the gradient of the temperature that exists in the material. Heat has the units of energy and this equation makes it explicitly clear that heat is a flow of energy which occurs in response to a temperature gradient. Flux of anything is the amount crossing through an area perpendicular to the direction of motion, per unit area, per unit time. In this case [math]kappa[/math] is a simple number, a scalar. A given temperature gradient in a material with a higher thermal conductivity will produce a greater flux of heat than the same temperature gradient in a material with a smaller thermal conductivity. This is a simplified description, but I hope it should serve to give the idea. Now, the heat equation, in the theory of heat transfer describes also how the temperature at every point in the material changes with time, and so also how the temperature gradient changes with time and it is commonly written as: [math]frac{partial T}{partial t} =alpha nabla^2 T[/math] This, you have to note first, is a partial differential equation which is supposed to be satisfied at every point inside a material which transfers heat only by conduction, such as an ordinary solid. Other forms of heat transfer exist in materials with a liquid or gaseous or solid state or in vacuum, and these must also be taken account of in general so the equations rapidly become really quite complex. However this is the basic idea. The constant [math]alpha[/math] is called the thermal diffusivity. It is related to the thermal conductivity, the density of the material and the specific heat capacity of the material at constant pressure (that the pressure is constant is fairly often a good starting approximation to make). The relation is as follows: [math]alpha = frac{kappa}{rho c_p}.[/math] So the thermal conductivity relates the size of the heat flux to the temperature gradient, while the thermal diffusivity actually determines how fast the material heats up or cools down at all points, once boundary conditions are given on the heat equation. It’s the thermal diffusivity that determines how fast heat flows from the hot end of a steel rod, let’s say, towards the cold end, if the rod is insulated at its surface, that is, if it is surrounded by a material with very low heat conductivity and diffusivity, along its whole length. To find out this rate of heat flow you would have to place boundary conditions on the heat flow, amounting to constant high temperature at one end and constant low temperature at the other end and then solve the heat equation, which will eventually reach a steady state, given a reasonable initial temperature distribution in the rod. Then you can compare the results with experiments."},{"prompt":"Why are HDMI cords so expensive?","completion":"You are trying to buy them at the wrong place."},{"prompt":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

From then on, their children and children’s children’s children’s children - carry the blessing of being a Jew, plus the horrors perpetrated on Jews by non-Jews - still. A Christian can become a Jew - as well as some Jews choose to become other religions. However, when Hitler wanted to exterminate Jews - all Jews and anyone with “one drop of Jew blood” were exterminated. My daughter’s father was born a Jew in Warsaw in 1930 - and in 1938 landed in the USA wearing tsitsis - and became an adult anti-Semitic Jew. I didn’t know until after children - and now our daughter hated his hypocrisy so much that she became a Catholic - and our son hates all religions and has no interest in Israel. When my ex died, she found that he was entitled to be buried in a family plot and so, the anti-Semitic Jew is buried in a Jewish cemetery - next to his mother - the woman he stole money from for years! I say: be whatever you choose - and suffer the consequences of your choice. As a person looking to become a Jew, I say: wear a Chai or Star of David or Mezuzah so all can see that you are a Jew (even if you are not). Remember: Jesus was a Jew.

Granite is made by solidification and cooling of magma deep within the earth over a period of millions of years. It is known as an igneous rock because of its origin from the cooling down of molten Magma. During the process of heating and then slow cooling, granite forms as an exceedingly hard material. Granite consists of primarily Feldspar, Quartz which are very hard minerals. Marble is known as metamorphic stone as it is made by the transformation of another type of stone called sedimentary stone. Sedimentary rocks form from sediments in the earth combined with buried plant life under the earth over a long period of time. These sedimentary rocks get metamorphosed into marble beneath intense heat and pressure. This method incorporates different minerals into the marble that can provide the stone engaging colors.

One common way to try and trace a name through a mobile number is to use an online phone directory or reverse phone lookup service. These services allow you to enter a mobile number and search for information such as the name of the person associated with the number, their address, and other contact details. Another way to try and trace a name through a mobile number is to use a people search engine, which allows you to search for a person by their name, phone number, or address. It's important to remember that these methods are not always accurate, and the information found may not be up-to-date. Additionally, in most cases, these methods require the person's consent, and it's illegal to use it for unauthorised or illegal purposes, like tracking someone's location or phone activity without their consent. You can also contact your mobile service provider, they may have a way to help you with this, but they will also need valid proof and legal reason for the trace."},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"I would go back in time and prevent the guy who invented time travel from inventing it.

Leasing is a way to get a new car while still paying the same amount that you would have paid if you had bought the car. However, if you want to buy a new car and you can afford the monthly payments and you don’t have problems with your credit or don’t need to build up your credit score, then buying is a better option. Buying a new car might seem like it would be more expensive, but in the long run you will end up paying less for it.

But first we address a few other people’s comments. #1: You don’t pick them up because your trained not to… No your trained not to rely on them. Many unites actually go to weapon familiarity training to learn to USE local weapons at least a little. #2: Your trained to listen for the sound of enemy weapons and fire at them!no… no your not. Your trained to listen to the sound of ANY weapon fire and think about what it means. In Iraq the (Allied) Iraqi military and police forces Use/Used AK’s. SO no… you don’t just fire at the sound of a AK. But back to your question. #1: If your out of ammo. Your going to do what ever you can. If there is a enemy weapon there, your going to use it. Soldiers even in Iraq/Afghanistan won awards for using enemy weapons when there weapons failed. (Most of the time your just going to pick a weapon up, fire the rounds in it, and then toss it) #2: In many wars, soldiers (Even professional one’s. not just ‘rabble’) often pick up the enemy weapon and keep them. (See WWII) Now that’s a little different then modern war for the US. (Which always has more materials) #3: Single use weapons are just as likely to be used. RPG’s. Grenades and so on. But there are a lot of rules for this. And training for it.

Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision: Financial Situation: Evaluate your current financial situation, including your income, expenses, and savings. Determine if you have enough savings to cover the upfront costs of buying a home or if you need a loan to finance the purchase.Interest Rates: Consider the prevailing interest rates on home loans. If interest rates are low, taking a home loan may be more favorable as it allows you to benefit from leverage and potentially earn higher returns on your invested savings.Loan Terms: Assess the terms and conditions of the home loan, including the interest rate, loan duration, and any associated fees. Understand the monthly payment obligations and the total cost of the loan over its duration.Monthly Budget: Review your monthly budget to see if you can comfortably afford to set aside a portion of your salary for savings without significantly impacting your lifestyle. It's essential to strike a balance between saving for a home and maintaining a reasonable quality of life.Investment Opportunities: Consider alternative investment options and their potential returns compared to the interest rate on the home loan. If you can invest your savings in avenues that offer higher returns than the loan interest, it may be more beneficial to take a loan and invest your savings elsewhere.Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your risk tolerance and financial stability. If you prefer lower financial risk and want to avoid debt, saving money from your salary might be a more suitable option for you.Long-Term Goals: Consider your long-term financial goals and how buying a home fits into your overall financial plan. Evaluate whether you want to prioritize owning a home quickly or if you have other financial objectives that require your attention. It's crucial to assess your financial situation, preferences, and goals before making a decision."},{"prompt":"What is your say to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's plan to open Sharia courts in all districts?","completion":"The demand of AIMPLB to setup Sharia Court in every district is very disturbing. Muslims (though there are many other religions) now and then demand separate systems for them (based on Quran). This is the outcome of politician's appeasement policy for the sake of vote bank. Let's talk about the practice of Nikah Halala, Polygamy, Khatna, Triple Talaq etc. . These are regressive practices and designed only to opress women. Just think if one can give talaq to his wife (because only men are allowed to) just by pronouncing it three times (even through mobile) and not liable to pay any maintenance to his (house)wife, is inhuman to say the least. We know that majority of indian women (married) are housewives and the number is even higher in Muslims, how would they sustain their livelihood. Also in case husband and wife want to get back together after divorce, wife has to undergo Nikah Halala which affects dignity and modesty of Muslim women. [LINKED_TEXT: AIMPLB to Set up 10 Shariat Courts, Says Nikah Halala is a Quranic Practice Beyond Challenge] [URL: https://www.news18.com/news/india/nikah-halala-is-a-quranic-practice-beyond-challenge-says-muslim-personal-law-board-1812517.html] When voices are raised against these practices, people from the community use Quran and religious freedom to justify the unethical practices. Recently, during one hearing in the apex court, Dawoodi Bohra community contended in the court that the practice should be allowed as religious freedom is guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution. [LINKED_TEXT: Female genital cutting: Bodily integrity of a woman can’t be infringed upon, says SC] [URL: https://scroll.in/latest/885849/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-seeking-ban-on-female-genital-cutting-on-july-16] This is because they have been emboldened by what happened in the past when Congress party led by Rajiv Gandhi, for the sake of vote bank, overturned ruling of supreme court regarding alimony given to Muslim Women. [LINKED_TEXT: Shah Bano vs Triple Talaq: Congress 1986 vs Congress 2017 - Times of India] [URL: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shah-bano-vs-triple-talaq-congress-1986-vs-congress-2017/articleshow/62293614.cms] Therefore, they always label BJP as an anti-Muslim to oppose the reforms and term it as an interference. Suppose people from every religion demand to resolve their personal matter based on their religious beliefs and not the constitutional values than what will be the role of judiciary in the country? In a secular country, there cannot be two sets of laws and that too based on religious beliefs. Isn't this sound ironic? Even learned person like former Vice-President Mohd. Hamid Ansari has given irresponsible statement regarding Sharia law.

There is no ‘gene’ that encodes for chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a complex organic molecule (NOT A PROTEIN) that is produced by a chain of enzymes (~14 enzymes) 2. We could theoretically design an enzyme that converts heme (as in hemoglobin) to chlorophyll ([LINKED_TEXT: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341161980_Bacteriochlorins_and_their_metal_complexes_as_NIR-absorbing_photosensitizers_properties_mechanisms_and_applications/figures?lo=1] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341161980_Bacteriochlorins_and_their_metal_complexes_as_NIR-absorbing_photosensitizers_properties_mechanisms_and_applications/figures?lo=1]): 3. But then what? Chlorophyll by itself does not do much more then absorb light. Any food coloring (or any color) will do the same. You need the protein environment. Here is a picture of one such system - there are 2, and the image is of [LINKED_TEXT: Photosystem II] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosystem_II]; note that for clarity its only part of the system (the full system is even more complex). Each colored ‘spring’ is a different protein, encoded by a different gene, thus there are ~25 genes in total for PSII alone. To make things worse these systems need to embedded in a membrane to work, and you need a specific arrangement of the membrane. 4. Even if we did get all the above working all we gain is proton motive force ([LINKED_TEXT: Chemiosmosis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiosmosis#Proton-motive_force]) that help us generate ATP ([LINKED_TEXT: ATP synthese] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase]) and electrons. Again, membrane embedment is needed. Humans have this mechanism (aka mitochondria) so lets skip it. 5. And then we actually need the whole [LINKED_TEXT: Calvin cycle] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle], where CO2 is fixed to sugars. That will take another ~9 enzymes. We also need the enzymes that make the compounds used in the cycle, like Ribulose-5-P (~4 enzymes). 6. Finally we need to worry about physics of light and gas diffusion. Ever wondered why most leaves are flat? Leaves are flat because (a) light does not penetrate very deep, and (b) CO2 does not solubilize well in water, the main component of every living cell. That why leaves need high surface to volume ratio. Humans suck in this ratio, that is why we have lungs, but the lungs are not exposed to light… Bottom line, the naive assumption that ‘if stupid plants can do it, it must be simple’ is simply wrong. Living systems are in general much more complex than man-made systems. Furthermore, they are ‘built’ by very different principles. Assume less and you will learn much more."},{"prompt":"New theory: in Endgame, could Tony Stark have given Steve Rogers a metal shield (instead of vibranium) before the final battle since he is still a little mad at him?

However, I can provide you with some general tips that may help you jumpstart your weight loss fast journey. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine. Here are some guidelines: 1. Create a calorie deficit: To lose weight fast, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Calculate your daily caloric needs and aim to create a deficit by reducing your calorie intake or increasing your physical activity. 2.Eat a balanced diet: Focus on consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages high in calories. 3.Portion control: Be mindful of your portion sizes. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control the amount of food you eat. Eating slower can also give your body time to recognize feelings of fullness. 4.Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can help control hunger, support digestion, and keep you hydrated. 5.Regular exercise: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, cycling) and strength training into your routine. Cardiovascular exercises burn calories, while strength training helps build muscle, which can boost your metabolism. 6.Increase physical activity: Find ways to be more active throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, go for short walks during breaks, or engage in activities you enjoy that get you moving. 7.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Sufficient sleep helps regulate appetite hormones and supports overall well-being. 8.Manage stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain or hinder weight loss fast. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. Remember, losing weight too quickly can be detrimental to your health and can lead to muscle loss or nutritional deficiencies. Aim for gradual, sustainable weight loss by making long-term lifestyle changes rather than relying on quick fixes. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.

The distinction between general dentistry and [LINKED_TEXT: cosmetic dentistry ] [URL: https://www.deviantart.com/blunncreekdental/art/Cosmetic-Dentistry-919456053]is quite straightforward. Patients who need dental work as well as those who want to see if those who have cavities will first visit a general dentist who is skilled in providing basic and preventive procedures.

Geoffrey Boycott: India has already lost the 1st test. Another loss here would mean losing the series. Ravi Shastri: India should never have allowed the Aussies to reach 445 after they had them at 269–8. Geoffrey Boycott: Harbhajan must be wondering what more he could have done after taking that hat-trick. Aussies have got this in their bag. Ravi Shastri: Well, as they say the match isn’t over until it’s over. Let’s see what India has got in store in their second innings. Mind you, they will be under tremendous pressure having been told to follow-on. ======================India’s 2nd Innings begin======================= Day-3 *After the loss of 1st wicket* Geoffrey Boycott: Looks like India has changed their batting order. Ravi Shastri: Yeah! It’s the half centurion from last innings, instead of the one the whole country is depending on. *India loses their second wicket and the man the whole country is eagerly waiting for arrives at the crease* Geoffrey Boycott: He is finally here. I wonder how much pressure he must be feeling. Ravi Shastri: There is a huge task ahead. His wicket is the difference between a Draw and an Australian win. *In the meanwhile, camera points at someone who is looking at the match with utmost concentration and suddenly, India loses another wicket.* Geoffrey Boycott: Australia have got him! Oh my god, that’s a huge wicket. Indian hopes must be dashed after this. Ravi Shastri: It’s not just another wicket, it’s Sachin Tendulkar. Who can save India now that he is gone. If I was an Indian fan, I wouldn’t keep my hopes high. *After a decent partnership with Laxman, the captain gets dismissed. Scoreboard reads 232–4* Geoffrey Boycott: Another one departs. India is still 42 runs behind and Ganguly is gone now. Ravi Shastri: This seemed like a good partnership. India’s chances of a draw are all but gone. *India’s No. 6 arrives on the crease and takes his guard.* There is this steely determination in his eyes even as the crowd starts to leave the stadium. He defends the 1st ball solidly and takes his guard again. India survive the day without any further loss. Day-4 Camera focuses on his eyes again.. They are not blinking, not even for a second while facing the ball, and the next ball and the ball after that. This man is batting with all his concentration on one thing and one thing only, to not lose his wicket. Day-4 ends with India at 589–4 and now at a position to dictate terms. Laxman is batting at 275 and on the other side is his partner at 155 n.o. Day-5 Geoffrey Boycott: When do you think will India declare now? The match has been saved and they should push for a win. Ravi Shastri: They do seem to be going for quick runs now. Let’s see what score Ganguly finds comfortable to declare at. *Laxman soon gets dismissed but his partner bats on. He is not giving his wicket away anytime soon.* Geoffrey Boycott: What an innings has it been. Laxman has played the innings of a lifetime. Ravi Shastri: He deserves all the applause from the crowd for that. Will India declare now? No signal from Ganguly yet. *India’s 6th wickets falls and then the 7th wicket through a run-out and it’s him* Geoffrey Boycott: I don’t think there was any other way to dismiss him. Only a run-out or a declaration could have stopped him from batting today. Ravi Shastri: I guess this is the reason why they call him ‘The Wall’. If India wins today, he deserves as much credit for it as Laxman. India wins and there he is finally smiling. Camera points at him again. He is relieved more than anything. He doesn’t want the MOM award or his name in articles tomorrow or on anyone’s lips. He got what he wanted — An Indian win! He stands there and soaks in the moment. He knows it’s a historical day and he is just glad to be a part of it. He closes his eyes and relives the moments again.

If two males can benefit from their combined earnings for perhaps a mortgage, then why not two brothers? That makes gay marriages unfair for other male connections. The death penalty, if preferred by the offender to life imprisonment with no expectancy for release. However, not administered by an official, but via three capsules, where just one is lethal.

My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.","completion":"It’s possible. Many other answers here lack context and a detailed discussion of the matter. Let’s begin with the story of Hannah Poling. From the CBS article: “Hannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months. Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed. It's taken more than two years for both sides to agree on how much Hannah will be compensated for her injuries. [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml] [URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml]In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't \\"cause\\" her autism, but \\"resulted\\" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism ‘test cases’ have been defeated at trial. Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court.” So it seems there are pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by vaccination leading to autism, such as in Hannah’s case. Arguably, the vaccines were causal in her case. We can examine the counterfactual to determine the truth - if she were not given the vaccines, then she would not have developed autism in the given timeframe. Many other answers then fail to cite an important fact - there was never an investigation into vaccine safety based on the knowledge of mitochondrial disease. Unfortunately, medicine is not too keen to undertake such an investigation. On the other hand, as part of receipt for compensation, the Polings were told to keep silent under a gag order. This might tell you something about the state of affairs our society is in. You can’t find evidence unless you earnestly look for it. The “absence of evidence” is not evidence that something cannot happen. So it is possible.

If you are the account holder for the mobile phone number in question, you may be able to access the call history by logging into your account on the mobile carrier's website or by contacting their customer service.

A powerful beginning for a wonderful book. We all need to dream a little to stay sane. But my favorite lines come after the opening lines. “Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met nearly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.” A must-read for sure. Now onto the next line, \\"The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation\\" —The Secret History, Donna Tartt The line just sets the scene. You know you are in for a ride. “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" —Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen From a classic with a classic beginning. Witty dialogues, clever prose, sharp humor, great social satire. The kind of book you must read before you die. “Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.” —The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, Douglas Adams A fun beginning.

Most planes do not have auto land—meaning the plane at some point has to be flown by hand, the autopilot is not designed to land the plane. There is no “auto-takeoff” feature. Takeoff and departure, and approach and landing are almost always hand flown. This is the most interesting and busy time of the flight. Climbs with intermediate level offs, turns to get to your assigned route, radio calls. checklists, power changes. Lots of things going. Once you get past the departure control airspace and into the enroute center airspace it quickly becomes rather boring—by now you are established on a heading that will take you to your first point on the flight plan where you are mostly going in a straight line. You also have a clearance to your final altitude. Somewhere along the line you engage the autopilot and let it handle the mundane aspects of flying while you monitor and pre-FMS, actually used a heading knob to command the autopilot to turn the plane. Hand flying a plane at altitude is hard work — air is thin requiring constant attention to maintain heading and altitude, and if the yaw damper isn’t working, you will not have a good day. Better to have a working autopilot. At some point in the descent, go back to hand flying where you get some beneficial practice and experience."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"It is difficult for economists and policymakers to foresee when a recession will occur and how severe it would be. Economic data and trends can shed light, but the economy is very sensitive to unforeseen occurrences and external forces. As a result, predicting whether or not a recession will occur in the near future is fraught with uncertainty. But there are indicators that a recession could be coming. An inverted yield curve is one warning of a possible economic downturn. Bond interest rates at various maturities are plotted on a graph called the yield curve. Generally speaking, the risk and uncertainty of lending money for a longer period of time is reflected in the higher yields offered by long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. However, an inverted yield curve occurs when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds, and this is seen as a precursor to a recession. This is because it indicates that investors are fretting more about the short-term than the long-term prospects of the economy. Slowing economic growth is another sign of a possible recession. Many countries' economies have reported slower growth rates in recent years, reflecting the global economic slowdown. The slowdown in global commerce that has resulted from trade tensions between the United States and China has had a significant impact on economies around the world. In addition, many nations' economies have slowed because of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on global supply networks and consumer spending. A recession can be exacerbated by high levels of debt and unstable finances. Countries with significant amounts of government debt, such as the United States, may be less able to weather economic storms. A financial crisis may also result from other factors, such as the increasing levels of corporate debt and the prevalence of unsafe lending practices. It's important to remember that although if these signs point to the possibility of a recession, they in no way ensure that one will actually happen. It's not uncommon for economic trends to shift suddenly, and unforeseen occurrences may derail economic growth. For instance, a possible recession may have been avoided if the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and the reopening of economies had resulted in a spike in economic activity. And fiscal and monetary policies can help stabilize the economy and lessen the blow of a downturn. In sum, it is challenging to forecast the exact date and depth of a recession, although there are warning signs that one may be approaching. There are a number of causes that could lead to a recession, including the inverted yield curve, sluggish economic development, and high levels of debt and financial instability. Economic forecasts are volatile and susceptible to sudden shifts in response to unforeseen occurrences and external forces. To maintain economic growth and stability, policymakers must constantly monitor and anticipate potential threats to the economy.

(To make it easier to understand - for instance it’s like the little Republic of Armenia nowadays standing up to and have the Russian army run for dear life screaming with brown pants. ) Those who call him a sadistic psycho skip two important details: 1) 15th century Europe was not exactly known for a gentle, dainty, and chivalrous way of treating enemies. I don’t see how impaling is any worse than the iron maiden, or quartering, or burning at the stake (practices preferred in Western Europe). They did what they had to do to set examples and warnings. At the time fear was the only method employed to handle most every situation. Starting with the catholic church who later judged Vlad and called him satan instead of worshiping him for having saved their cassock wrapped asses. (Mehmet II had vowed after conquering Constantinople to feed his horse his oats out of the altar of the Saint Peter’s in Rome) 2) Vlad could not have possibly impaled tens of thousands of Turks himself. He gave the order, and the soldiers in his army executed it. So not only him, but the entire Wallachian army set that warning. Gladly, and rightfully so. On a different note - I personally don’t think Vlad’s entire dynasty (Draculesti) was named after some medal bestowed on one of the members. The order of the Dragon would’ve meant fuckall to Vlad at the time. The dynasty was probably named after the ancient Dacian war flag (the Drakon)."},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"I believe people can understand one having to defend their life or the life of another but it’s clear to me that everyone that has a gun isn’t an angel.

That means the socket might be working even if the bulb doesn't light up. You might as well look for another socket without checking this one if you are going to wear slippers.

The wiki page [LINKED_TEXT: Test light] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_light] confirms this: A low-cost type of test lamp only contacts one side of the circuit under test, and relies on stray capacitance and current passing through the user's body to complete the circuit. Disclaimer: If you get shocked, don't sue me for telling you not to wear footwear. It probably means that either the tester is faulty, you touched the tester's tip that's in direct contact with the live pin, or there is some other issue. If you want to be cautious, use some equipment like a phone charger or hair-dryer, or just get a qualified electrician to check it for you."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"Years ago, circa 1980, I was walking down the sidewalk and saw a police officer, a woman, and two young boys, the were perhaps early teens, perhaps a bit younger.

The boy said no and the woman turned to the officer and said ‘That’s okay officer, I don’t want to file a report.” She turned to her son and said “You know that the rule is that you always lock your bike if you leave it outside like this.” That was, and still is, the most creative discipline applied to a child.

Here are the key benefits of using eSIM: 1. Flexibility and Convenience: eSIM eliminates the need for a physical SIM card, allowing you to switch between mobile carriers without changing the physical card.You can add multiple eSIM profiles to a single device, enabling you to have separate lines for personal and business use or when traveling internationally. 2. Remote Activation: eSIM activation can be done remotely, without the need for a physical SIM card to be inserted. This makes it easier to set up new devices or switch carriers. 3. Storage and Space Efficiency: eSIM is embedded directly into the device's hardware, freeing up the SIM card slot for other purposes, such as expandable storage.It eliminates the risk of losing or damaging physical SIM cards. 4. Global Roaming Simplified: When traveling, you can easily switch to a local carrier's network through eSIM, without having to buy a new SIM card or change your number. 5. Instant Activation: eSIM activation is typically faster than traditional SIM card activation, as it doesn't require manual insertion and setup. 6. Streamlined Device Setup: When purchasing a new device, eSIM allows for a quicker and smoother activation process, reducing the need for physical handling of SIM cards. 7. Compatibility with IoT Devices: eSIM is particularly useful for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wearables, as it allows them to be connected to cellular networks without the need for large SIM cards. 8. Enhanced Security: eSIM technology incorporates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. 9. Reduced Plastic Waste: With eSIM, there's less reliance on physical plastic SIM cards, contributing to a reduction in e-waste and environmental impact. 10. Remote Management: Carriers and device manufacturers can remotely manage and update eSIM profiles, making it easier to provide new services or switch plans without the need for a physical swap. 11. Future-Proofing: eSIM technology is becoming increasingly common and supported by more carriers and devices, making it a future-proof choice. 12. No Physical Swaps: eSIM eliminates the inconvenience of swapping SIM cards between devices, especially if you frequently switch between devices. In summary, eSIM offers greater flexibility, convenience, and efficiency compared to traditional physical SIM cards. It simplifies the process of changing carriers, setting up new devices, and managing multiple lines, making it an attractive option for modern mobile users."},{"prompt":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

The problem is what we base our universe on. We have put all of our chips on gravity as being the sole creator of the universe. We are convinced that gravity alone can turn ordinary matter into the greatest objects known to man. It can't. It is impossible to realize how the history of our universe unfolded but so many questions about what we see now can be answered if we just would realize that gravity doesn't make heat but heat makes gravity. It is a “chicken or the egg” type situation. We think it was gas and dust turning into a star or black hole when really the matter started out superheated and was creating the gravity from the beginning. Our galaxy was one spinning, fusion filled mass. It flattened and cooled. After that, our stars were spinning, fusion filled masses. They flattened then cooled. Then our planets, again, fusion filled masses. They flattened and cooled creating the moon's and rings. So many questions answered. Why most everything rotates in nearly the same plane is answered. Why is everything so hot is answered. Why things we see billions of light years away are so bright are answered. Why stars start forming when the black hole seems to still have more to consume is answered.

In universe, the answer is pretty simple; the Borg got too cocky, and picked a fight with the wrong people. as another poster commented, the Undine-Borg war destroyed hundreds if not thousands of Borg ships, and dozens of their stronghold worlds. Considering the Borg also got a cube destroyed by the Romulans, and 2 destroyed by the federation, along with an important transwarp conduit. They clearly decided to take a step back and regroup. In real life? The Borg had become pretty impossible to write for realistically. They started off as an all powerful, nearly unstoppable juggernaut, got a pasting, came back with a vengeance, got one again, got too cocky and nearly got destroyed, survived only through the intervention of Voyager, and became a serious threat once again only to get their butts handed to them again. all of this came together to make the Borg an increasingly unrealistic threat moving forward, unless they became even more powerful, at which point it would strain credulity quite a bit to see them still defeated in the end.

I was one of those kids who loved to sniff around at home and satisfy her curiosity by monkeying with the contents of the drawers, closets, and wardrobes (to my mother’s great dismay); and who wondered at the occasional interesting vintage object that happened to come her way. And one day I came across this whiskey bottle that had been hiding in a shady corner of a display cabinet in our living room, concealed by a chaotic arrangement of porcelain knick-knacks, small flower vases, old picture frames with black and white photographs encased in them, and other nostalgic paraphernalia that you can find in an average Turkish household. But a whiskey bottle? A whiskey bottle was really out of place in our home, especially considering that my mom was a sworn teetotaller. In my fascination, I took the bottle in my hand and fumbled with it, and only then noticed a slit in the glass, which ran along the periphery of the bottle somewhere in the middle, and seemed to split the bottle into two halves. (If you look closely, you can see the slit I mention in the picture above as well. It is above the label, but beneath the beam of light reflected off the surface of the bottle.) So as a next step, I gripped the neck of the bottle and pulled it up and voila! I saw this. ([LINKED_TEXT: image source] [URL: https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/8080/3348/XXX_8080_1337980319_1.jpg]) The upper part of the “bottle” easily came off, and about two dozen small metallic cylindrical tubes popped out with a tinkle and spread like the petals of a lotus flower before my eyes. I was seriously confused, and took the bottle to my mom to ask her what this “bottle” actually was. To my surprise, she told me that the object in my hand was a “cigarette dispenser.” The cigarettes would be inserted in those little brass cylinders, and when the bottle was opened, they would pop out, and you could pick your cigarette. You see, in times of yore, people did not really know much about how hazardous smoking was to your health (hey, remember how common cigarette ads used to be in the past, and how they glorified and romanticized smoking!), and smokers practically outnumbered non-smokers. Therefore, believe it or not, it used to be a mundane affair to offer cigarettes to your guests in Turkey, as if you were simply offering them tea or coffee. And since Turkish people cannot bear to offer something to their guests in an unpretentious, plain package; they wanted to add some elegance to it and thus pamper the guests - and as a result, my family purchased one of these fancy cigarette dispensers that deceptively looked like a whiskey bottle. (I can only speculate about when these cigarette dispensers became popular in Turkey, and I surmise that this object may have come into our possession in the late 70s or so.) From a contemporary perspective, everything about this object looks weird to me. Since we are much more knowledgeable about the dangers of smoking (and also second-hand smoking) today, I cannot imagine my mother offering any cigarettes to our guests, even if she knew they were smokers. In addition, in the current conservative climate of Turkey, I don’t think anyone would want to sell cigarette dispensers in the form of a whiskey bottle, lest they alienate some religious customers who smoke cigarettes but vehemently abstain from alcohol and cannot even tolerate the idea of getting their cigarettes from a dispenser that remotely resembles a whiskey bottle. All in all, I think it was an interesting vintage object and I wish we didn’t throw it away. It had a beautiful story, and it shed light on a tiny but intriguing chapter of the history of “domestic life” in Turkey, if you like. I would have liked to keep it."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Cologne, Perfume, or Body Spray?

She came to power off the heels of a civil war, from the unpopular yet Republic supported New Mandalorian faction, and started preaching pacifism while proceeding to erase centuries, if not millenia, of a proud warrior society rich with culture. That's not a good start to a successful or popular reign, but her administration was also rife with corruption at all levels, and she faced resentment from many of her people, notably the Kyr'tsad, or Death watch organization. Maybe she could have eventually smoothed out the kinks, but the clone wars broke out across the galaxy, and Mandalore faced so many challenges, external and internal, that her rule went up in flames, literally. Maybe, under different circumstances, she could have been a good leader for her people, but as it stands her policy was ineffective, her power base weak and corrupt, and her ideals were just that, ideal, but not what her people needed."},{"prompt":"the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?","completion":"In the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?

When H'El was created. He was created because the blood samples in the Kryptonian ship sent by Jor-El, they were meant to be exposed to different kinds of interstellar energy, to see what the effects would be on Kryptonian physiology. The ship was thus programmed to allow certain dosages of stellar or interstellar radiation enter the ship, and expose the blood samples to those energies. And the energy of a Quasar made it so from the blood samples H'El was created. And H'El got his Kryptonian physiology permanently evolved. To the point he no longer needed any sunlight at all to keep his powers working, same as red sunlight could not depower him. Even Kryptonite couldn't kill him. And magic barely affected him, if anything at all. H'El had all the powers that a yellow empowered Kryptonian has and much more. He didn't had just the abilities, but far more raw power, and he had other abilities within Kryptonian potential unlocked and very developed. Like… Highly advanced telepathy, highly advanced telekinesis, teleportation, chronokinesis, and other powers H'El wasn't even aware he had them, seeing a yellow empowered Superman has them. So those blood samples were just exposed to a limited dose of the energy emitted by this… A Quasar is just the supermassive Black Hole at the center of a galaxy, feeding on matter and energy. While GRB (gamma ray bursts) are the byproduct of stars that go Hypernova. Not supernova. Hypernova! Hypernovas only happen when a star is massive enough to create a Black Hole. And unlike its weaker brother the Supernova, it emits most of its energy through two jets. With some particles moving close to the speed of light, and others moving actually at the speed of light. So what would be better for a Kryptonian?! A GRB obviously. The types of energy emitted by a Quasar and a GRB are mostly the same. The main differences are the energy released per second and how long is that energy emitted. Most GRB’s emit far more energy than a Quasar per second, although a Quasar lasts longer and thus will release more energy in its entirety. Om average a GRB lasts only 30 seconds, but it can last one second, ten seconds… It depends on the mass of the star. So here's a simple example… Superman exposed to a GRB and a Quasar for let's say 30 seconds. In a GRB during those 30 seconds, Superman could be exposed to something like 8.8E+47 Joules. While with a Quasar during those 30 seconds, Superman would only be exposed to something between ~9.75E+36 Joules and ~1.95E+39 Joules. Our entire sun only has an energy output of 3.8E+26 Joules. That's why a GRB would be better for Superman and Kryptonians in general, seeing they would get more energy per second than with a Quasar. And if H'El is used as a measuring tool, then if Superman absorbed all the energy of one of the energy jets of a GRB, then he should immediately start to evolve into his Superman-Prime OM evolutionary stage, and go beyond it. Where Superman would have all the powers of Superman-Prime OM and more. Which considering Superman-Prime OM was stated to possess powers far beyond those ever held by any meta, then you would get a Nigh-Omnipotent character in seconds. All of that in less than a minute. So if Superman was pressed for time he could use a GRB to permanently evolve his powers, putting them closer to his true potential. Into perhaps something like this… A Superman that was Nigh-Omnipotent, and thus capable of also being Nigh-Omniscient and Nigh-Omnipresent. Too powerful to limit himself to any Multiverse in the countless Multiverses of DC. Becoming a being of the Omniverse."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

They are still teaching math in math classes but then teaching that it’s been used for evil in other classes. They have also experimented with teaching base 20 because Aztecs used it. That’s a very risky strategy. There has been a tendency for decades for minorities to dismiss schools as “white man’s knowledge”. Teaching that math and science have been used to enforce systemic racism is a good way to instill a dislike of math and science. There’s a related school of thought to this that says “whiteness” is obsessed with “getting the right answer” and that we should be more understanding of “2+2=5”. That teaches minorities that they shouldn’t be held to the same standards as whites which is also harmful."},{"prompt":"w do you vote with your dollars?","completion":"I absolutely do. For example, to the limits of my ability, I have not knowingly given one penny to any enterprise owned by Rupert Murdoch. I have even rigged my television so that it cannot receive the local Fox Entertainment station. When he bought them, I stopped subscribing to the WSJ and Barrons (because Murdoch’s ownership of them makes them an inherently unreliable source of factual information). When we go on vacation in the US, we do not spend money in states that have Voter ID or anti-choice laws. It was tough to avoid when we visited the Badlands, but we managed to avoid spending any money in Nebraska and I let the Chamber of Commerce know about it too… and why. I do not patronize that chain of craft stores or the chicken filet chain (although to be honest I originally stopped because IMO the food was not very good), because they insist that in order to exercise their religious rights they must be allowed to infringe the religious and civil rights of other Americans. I do not patronize any business that pays any of its employees so poorly that they qualify for Public Assistance (no MallWart, no Amizone, no McDougals) or that refuses to offer full time employment to the majority of the company’s workers. I consider the boycott to be nothing more than a legitimate expression of the free-market at work, because in a free market the lowest price is not the only consideration.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","completion":"I’ve spent a lot of time working with standby generators, but none of them were fueled with natural gas. Here are my preferences, for what they are worth: Gasoline sours in storage. If it sits for 6 months, it goes bad. For this reason alone, it is a bad choice. Gasoline is also more prone to explode than other choices. If gasoline is used, be sure and add fuel stabilizer to the tank.Propane works well and doesn’t go bad like gasoline. It burns clean and is easy to use. The major problem, depending on your location would be availability during an extended outage.Diesel wins as far as I am concerned. It is less volatile than the other choices, and is readily available. It stores well and generates more power than others as well.More thoughts: It is important to exercise standby generators. My routine was to fail the incoming power and start the generator and let it run under load. This was done once per month (We had ATS Automatic Transfer Switch). Change the oil and fuel filters annually."},{"prompt":"After you prepared to retire, what area of your life did not go as planned?","completion":"My plan was to retire at age 66 as half of a couple. My husband was essentially pushed into early retirement by job loss at age 61 during the recession. Not a total deal breaker. We re-calibrated our financial plans and could make it work if I stayed the course at work and continued saving/investing. He filed for his social security benefits at 63. Things would probably have worked out just fine. But the night of November 12, 2014, my husband of 43 years inexplicably drove away from the house, leaving his phone behind. We suspected sleep walking, maybe aggravated by the meds he was taking for prostate cancer. His body was found the next day in his overturned truck just a few miles from home. Nothing prepares you for a gut-punch like that. Once I started to emerge from the brain fog of grief, I adjusted my life plan and financial plans. I extended my retirement date to 68–1/2. Financially, I've made it work, but I would have enjoyed retirement more as a couple rather than as a lone retiree."},{"prompt":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie “300”? If it was, then did Persians raise the three empires of Achamedians, Safavid, and Sasanian?","completion":"Yes, Persia was very powerful in ancient times. So powerful, in fact, that they created one of the largest empires in the world. They were able to conquer the civilizations of the Middle East, and they were even able to conquer Egypt, one of the most advanced ancient civilizations. The Persians also nearly conquered another great ancient civilization in Greece, but the Greeks stopped them as it was portrayed in the movie “300”. The Persians did indeed create the 3 empires that you said. Here is the Persian Empire at it’s greatest extent: As you can see, it’s pretty damn big. It has territories in 3 continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. To conquer and manage that big of an empire, you have to be pretty damn powerful. 300 is just a movie based on a comic book. It’s not really historically accurate. But the Greeks did regard the Persians as “barbarians”, because they were not Greek.

Mistakes can be expensive and devalue your property. But if you can do them well and have the time, it will save you money. On the other hand, even if you can, it just may not be worth the hassle. Sometimes pros can save you hassle and money. If you hire, interview well. References from people you trust may help you get started, but sometimes those you trust and should know better will send you people who will rip you off or are incompetent or inexpensive because they really don’t know any better. Also remember that when you ask contractors for references, they are not going to give you the names of their dissatisfied customers but rather of those who like their work best. Or their mothers or best friends. Also don’t rely on Craigslist, especially, or Angie’s list or the other lists of supposedly top professionals. Some of the lists are only sites where those listed pay to be on them (depending on what lists).

I am blessed and humbled to have Telugu as my Mother Tongue.. 1) The first and Foremost Thing I like about Telugu is that , we call Kids ether in adorable manner or in respectful manner as “Amma/Nanna” (Mother /Father).. Like “ Ituchudandi naanna, itu vinale amma, adi kaadu nanna/naayana, etc” ..Even many teachers address students as “Arthamayinda Amma, Arthamayinda nanna”.. That is the beauty of telugus.. we see our elders in children !! This is in addition to “kanna, buji, bidda, etc” (the adorable addresses specific to children).. Perhaps it is more to do with culture than language, as it is primary way of addressing children, I put it as part of language.. 2) Another Beautiful aspect of Telugu is Having Dvyarthi and Trayarthi kavyas (Double and triple Entendres[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre]) .. Very few languages have that like Sanskrit or Kannada /Tamizh have such extremely tough poetic works.. Take the examples of Raghava Pandaveeyam, Raghva Yadava Pandavaeeyam, etc It is said that Vemulawada Bhimakavifirst written “Raghava Pandaveeyam”, a work which was lost in course of time.. But During Golden Age of telugu Literature in Viajayanagara SriKrishna Devaraya Time, one of his court poets (Ashta Diaggajas)- Pingali Surana has written Raghava Pandaveeyam and is said to have mentioned earlier work of Bhima kavi.. In Raghava Pandaveeyam , Surana had written in such a way that if we read the kavyam/poetic book from first to last with one meaning , we get the story of Ramayana . If read the same book from first to last by considering the other meaning of words , we get the story of Mahabharata.. Two epics !! Raghava Yadava Pandaveeyam tells the story of Rama, Krishna and mahabharatha by considering three different meanings of the words.. Think the beauty of creativity in that.. And just assume how tough and hard problem is it,.. People from Mathematics and Computer Science domains can easily analyze the complexity of this problem— “The poet has to chose the words that will have different meanings, which should satisfy the grammatical set up, also the words which will help the flow of the story , the character names in completely two different and long stories, and most importantly making it interesting to readers !!” I think it is definitely NP-Hard problem.. Perhaps it will be a great insight into algorithmic and NLP research if we try to decode the algorithm employed by these poets to scale double entendres to such a long epic !! Even Shakespeare is said to have written double entendres of not more than one paragraph due to the complexity of the problem!! Just great , no words !! 3) What I like about telugu is that it is highly classical , beautiful and musical both with and without vowel ending.. Many feel that telugu is beautiful just because of vowel Ending.. No it is also beautiful even with consonant ending !! Observe the following images of Anjaneya Dandakam—It is musical and beautiful even with consonant endings..!! Beautiful mixture of Telugu and Sanskrit without any abrupt break.. Personally, I feel that Telugus should have popularized Anjaneya Dandakam across india, just like that of Hanuman chalisa of Braj bhasha..Both are equally divine and spiritual.. 4) I can also say about great Mathematical and poetic arts of Chandasu , Avadhanam (which is present only in Telugu after Sankritam, and Kannada also adopted it later)..or Musical or Literary beauty of telugu.. But what makes telugu unique is that its ease to mix with other languages..Not only telugu enables great compatibility with these non-native languages, but also enriched the language with vocabulary and increased its idioms strength. (My answer is definitely going to hurt the feelings of Pure Telugu enthusiasts (which even includes me).. But I am here to show the beauty of my language , not confirming that pure telugu is impossible task..) You may question, does having loan words is quite common in all languages.. Off late Englsih is loaned in all languages, what is so special about telugu than?? You can’t easily differentiate loan words from Telugu as telugu has a trait of great rapport and intermingling with the languages that it loans the words from.. We all know the major languages that Influenced telugu- “Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian/urdu and English”, right..? The amalgamation with these languages in some literary works is so high that even after absence of almost all telugu vocabulary (except few connecting prepositions), the whole work is passable as telugu .. Even in the above Anjaneya Dandakam, the bold lyrics are initially completely in Sanskrit and suddenly it turns into Telugu (but even the telugu part in this dandakam has many Sanskrit loan words).. On a side note, It would be beautiful, if we coin pure Telugu words for the Telugu section of Anjaneya Dankdakam, keeping the Sanskrit Section as it is.. It would be another beautiful gem of Telugu !! And Sanskrit /Samskrutam is definitely.. See the following Sankeertana of Naada Brahma Tyagaraja swami varu (a great Saint -Composer of Carnatic Music). Ragam : Atana (29th melakartha janyam) Talam : Adi See the following link for meaning and lyrics in Englsih transliteration [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] [URL: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] In the above lyric, the ones which are in bold are actually “Telugu” (even in that Samayam , daya Sanskrit loans, hence italicized them)..And the remaining are all Sanskrit with strict Sanskrit pronunciation itself..Even If you see the flow either during singing or during reading, you don’t see any break and it continues as a single language.. that is the beauty of telugu.. Not even Indo-Aryan languages can amalgamate and gel with Sanksrit so well as Telugu !! Or see the following composition from Annamacharya (hailed as Andhra Pada Kavitaa Pitamaha).. In fact I like the style of Annamayya , he composed Keertanas in pure Sanskrit, pure telugu and in varying degree of Sanskrit -Telugu mix !! Ragam: Bowli (15th Melakartha (Mayamalavagowla) Janyam) , Talam:Adi The only bold ones are actually Telugu , remaining whole Keertana is in Sanskrit, but you will never feel that it is Sanksrit Song.. The telugu is used only for pronouns and conjunction !! You know telugu even gels well with English, and perhaps my large-hearted Telugu scholars have written and composed a classical “Jhavali” for Bharatanatyam in “Karaharapriya” raagam with lyrics as a mixture of Telugu_English way back in early 1800s . See one charanam of the javali of “Oh my lovely lalana” composed by Karur Sivaramayya garu O my lovely LalanaElane PommantiItuvanti Step, is it fit to take?Sit a while hereLet me convince you. In the above only the bold words are telugu, remaining is English..Perhaps it is a first of its kind of Literary Fusion with English in classical arts of India !! Karur Sivaramayya garu is known to have written many such javalais mixing Kannada, Tamizh , English and Telugu languages. [LINKED_TEXT: Exploring hasya rasa in Bharatanatyam] [URL: https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/exploring-hasya-rasa-in-bharatanatyam/article27548322.ece] I need not tell about Amalgamation of Urdu and telugu.. As my friend Thilak has said, there are many old Telugu songs like “Joruga husharu ga shikarukeldama”.. (except preposition and last verb , everything is Urdu !!).. It is said that Yayati Charitram of Telaganna also has Persian loans (this work of yayati charitra is often cited as pure Telugu work) Will add more later.. :) Sorry for hurting pure Telugu notion..

Don’t expect her to do the cooking, the washing up, the drying up and putting away. The housework, the washing, make your bed, clean the bath/shower/toilet after you and the shopping.

The whole family should be a team, and contribute evenly, not leave it to one person. Accept the word of one who knows! Buy your mother a little present now and again. Just to show that you think about her and appreciate her. It doesn’t have to be expensive. Some of her favourite flowers or chocolates, or a cheap ornament. Go up to her every now and again, randomly, give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek and tell her you love her. Have fun with your mother sometimes, your Dad too.

So here goes: The friends you have now, probably won't be the same ones you have when you're older, and that's not a bad thing. Accept that.Know that despite what the adults say, you are in fact capable feeling love for someone else, but don't confuse sex with love. They're not the same thing.Don't do drugs. For real. There are so many other ways to experience “high's” (conquering a mountain, giving a speech in front of a huge crowd, scoring the winning basket). Drugs do nothing but alter who you are, in the worst way, not to mention put your life at risk. Life only gets tougher along the way and trust me, you're going to need every single brain cell to thrive.Either get off of social media completely or limit yourself. At 14, all it's going to is encourage you to compare yourself to those who may seem like they have it all when they don't. It's not real. You are real. Stay real.This is an extension of 4. DO NOT PUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE ONLINE!! You will absolutely be judged by every single move you make in life. It's perfectly okay to make mistakes and do dumb things (as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else). Don’t give future employers or important people in your life reasons to hold you back from your dreams.Learn to be selfless. It's tough not to be self-centered when you're only 14 and trying to figure yourself out, but do for others when there's no benefit to you (other than feeling good about who you are).If you have good parents, love them. Cherish them. Honour them and all of the hard work they put into raising you by stepping out into the world and being the best human you can be.Love. Hard. But don't let it ruin or change who you are, unless it's for the better.Study. Don't cheat. And make your teachers your allies. You would be amazed at how much they can help you in the future.Explore your sexuality…with yourself. Before you share your body with someone else, learn to be a lover. Don't sell sexuality, exploit it or take it for granted. Stay away from hardcore porn. It teaches you nothing and it's all fake anyway. Know that consent is very black and white. NO ONE is permitted to put their hands on your body unless you say so. And if it's against your say so, scream it from the mountain tops. It's not okay. Ever.Don't follow the herd. Dare to go in the other direction, and start now. The world is going to throw a whole lot of BS your way and you need to be strong enough to stand up to it.Know that family comes in all walks of life and doesn't necessarily share DNA. Embrace those who want to raise you up, and stay in their corner when they need the same from you.Travel if you can. And if you need ideas on how you can do that at 14, ask me. I'll help.If and when depression hits, don't give into the darkness. We need you here. You're 14, you've got an incredible opportunity to create the most amazing life for yourself. Don't give up. Again, we need you here so we can witness your greatness.Eat well. I don't care if you're a vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, whatever. Put good things into your body and it will pay you back 10 fold.Learn to be humble, when to show confidence, when to be vulnerable and when to take initiative. You first have to listen and be observant, but these are states of being that will fling doors open.Learn to be grateful.Don't be tolerant, be accepting. Just because we don't agree with someone doesn't mean we can't love them, or like them. Don't let differences divide unless the differences are harmful.Be kind to animalsLaugh. Be silly. Cry.

There is a popular belief that having strict/over-protective parents will make people go totally off the rails when given the chance when they’ve reached the age of majority.As in, “Now that I’m finally free, I can do whatever I want… WooHoo!”. Well, yes, while that is indeed true for some, I can only speak for myself and base it on my own experience(s) thereof. Although, I now know and understand to a certain degree why they acted that way and set the boundaries that they did during my childhood.I have to admit that I really hated them for it back then and for a very long time after. In fact some of it still haunts me to this day…Something countless shrinks must have been tired of hearing about up through the years since then. Indeed boundaries are important, there’s no doubt about that.But being too strict or over-protective can also inadvertently be harmful too.Just like every other type of animal, humans learn from experience. And as such, not being allowed to have said experiences will cripple a person’s development from an early age. That is a very bad thing… Not to mention that it can fester hate and resentment towards the ones that one would normally love, admire and also to some degree respect. One thing I really hated back then and even to this day is inconsistency, either you are strict and/or over-protective or you are not. I can’t stand it when someone is treating you really sh!tty.And then suddenly completely out of the blue they start sucking up to you, showering you with gifts and whatnot like nothing happened. Just for them to feel justified about going back to being sh!tty to you all over again.Rinse and repeat… Firm, but fair is my take on how I treat someone under my care even if it was/is only temporary.There’s a very big difference between living wild and free, and that of a life on a proverbial leash.

Here are some strategies to help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels:Eat a balanced diet: Focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages high in added sugars. Opt for foods with a low glycemic index, as they cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels.Portion control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid consuming excessive calories and carbohydrates in one sitting. Consider using smaller plates and bowls to help with portion control.Choose complex carbohydrates[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #hcnrc]: Opt for complex carbohydrates that have a lower impact on blood sugar levels, such as whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. These foods are rich in fiber, which slows down the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream.Include protein in meals: Including protein-rich foods, such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, and legumes, can help stabilize blood sugar levels and promote satiety. Protein slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar.Limit sugary beverages: Sugary drinks, including soda, fruit juices, and sweetened coffee or tea, can cause significant spikes in blood sugar levels. Opt for water, unsweetened tea, or infused water as your primary beverages.Regular physical activity: Engage in regular exercise, as physical activity helps improve insulin sensitivity and aids in the utilization of glucose by the muscles. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises.Stay hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to stay hydrated, as dehydration can affect blood sugar levels.Manage stress levels: High levels of stress can affect blood sugar control. Incorporate stress management techniques such as exercise, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies to help reduce stress.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night, as poor sleep can disrupt hormone regulation and affect blood sugar control.Monitor blood sugar levels: If you have diabetes or prediabetes, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as recommended by your healthcare provider. This can help you track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle or medication if needed. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, to develop a personalized plan for blood sugar control that suits your specific needs and medical conditions. They can provide guidance, monitor your progress, and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

He announced this plan today in Michigan.","completion":"It sounds to me like it will do more harm than good. People forget that the USA is also a major exporter of products. The more you tax companies and the more you add taxes to any components they buy from overseas the less competitive we will be in the world market place. I am a tiny little manufacturer who does export quite a bit of our products. We use Honda engines which although based in Japan are actually made in China. All small engines are made overseas. The valves we use are made in China and most of the steel we use is imported. Now if we have lots of taxes on the imported components our costs will go up and we will cease to be competitive and will be less able to sell our products in Russia, Australia, Europe, and Asia which are nice markets for us right now. Even though the tax rates will be higher we will likely pay less in taxes because our sales will decrease. We may be able to cut some costs by laying off people and outsourcing more of our actual production to China but that is the best option I can think of to cut the higher costs we will be incurring. I see his changes causing us to sell less, to profit less and to offshore more production."},{"prompt":"What's your single best piece of advice for anyone?","completion":"I guess this ine has to be a perfect advice for leadership management"},{"prompt":"What is the slickest way a person has gotten out of a traffic ticket?","completion":"I’ve heard stories.

None of those work. Once I watched a woman get arrested for indecent exposure for doing it. I’ve seen men proposition officers as well. I’ve heard ‘I’m late’, ‘I have to use the bathroom’, ‘my beeper went off’, etc. One excuse that did work on my partner was ‘my wife is having a baby’. He was telling the truth, we called an ambulance and a fireman delivered the baby on the side of the road.

The topmen either go aloft, gather up the sail, and tie the fabric so less area is exposed, thus reducing the stress on the sail, the yard, and the mast. Large sails in the Age of Sail could have as many as three reefs taken in them before simply brailing up the sail to the yard. Reducing the sail area will cause the ship to sail more comfortably in strong winds, and prevent the sticks from being ripped out of her (being dismasted, in more formal terms). It generally is done only in bad weather."},{"prompt":"w prevalent is cheating at MIT?","completion":"Not to be “that guy” but if you’re really paying a school to teach you something, what’s the point of cheating?

We know how human life first started on the earth, how humans developed into successful societies that lasted for many years, and how these societies were destroyed. “We know, and have documentation to prove that the First Dispensation of Humanity on Earth lasted for almost two million years. A ‘dispensation’ is a measure of time that we (the Real Illuminati®) distinguish as a period when all humans upon the earth know of each other and are cooperating together. “During the First Dispensation of human time, all of humanity was cooperating as a people of one heart and one mind, and there were no poor people among them—until they ended up destroying themselves. We have not yet explained clearly how these highly advanced civilizations of humans ended up destroying themselves. One day, we intend to explain all things clearly. “For now, we ask you, the youth, to consider what you are learning: humans can control the laws of nature. In the past recorded history of this, the Sixth Dispensation of Human Time, people did not know how much control they could have over these laws. In ignorance, our ancestors created gods whom they believed had power and control over nature. Now that you have learned that YOU are the life forms that can control nature, doesn’t it make sense that you could also learn to control God? And if you learned to control God, you could also learn how to control those who speak for God, who act in God’s name, and who control your lives in the name of God.” —A New American Scripture, Chapter 20: The Great Apocalypse—A Message to the Youth of Planet Earth, pages 598–599. What we have also learned from the Real Illuminati®, however, is that, during our current mortal experience, we can choose to become as little children in our disposition, which changes our current outlook and ability to understand Real Truth® and to find happiness in our current existence: “[W]e reiterated throughout our new American scripture that ‘becoming like a little child’ is themost important aspect of learning Real Truth®. We included ‘becoming like a little child’ in our new American scripture because of its importance in helping people be able to uncover deceptions that they have previously been convinced of throughout their life. We used ‘become like a little child’ as a foundation. In other words, ignore what you have been taught since you were a little child.” —A New American Scripture, Chapter 3: The Greatest Human Deception, page 77.

So at most you lose the rear brakes but the car will stop using the front BUT it will take more time and the discs can get so hot that the car wont stop but this is if you are going at a high rate of speed. Coming to stop from normal driving speeds you would be able to stop in time. let’s assume the perpetrator cuts front and rear brakes, two things you can do to slow down the car is the emergency brake and shifting to a lower gear. The emergency brake should not be applied in a manner where the rear brakes will lock up and making you lose control of the vehicle. What I would do the second I realize I have no brakes is shift to a lower gear on the transmission. so say i am in Drive(overdrive) and i have ample room to slow down, I would shift to regular drive then to L2 once speed is greatly lost, I would shift into L1 and then slowly use the emergency brake to come to a full stop. Then call the cops to see who cut your brake lines."},{"prompt":"My rabbit has the skin and fur on the top of his head peeled off.

Real Estate investing is a business. The owner of the property buys the property then rents out the property as a “Housing Service Provider”. It is a business. In most cases, the rent payments received from Tenants covers costs only for the upkeep, repair and maintenance of the building. It is a SERVICE. For people who are working, just starting out and still saving to be able to buy their first home will natually rent their 1st home. And for those who do not have any intention of owning a property - they will have to rent the roof over their heads. The “profit” that you are referring to is coming from the increase in equity of the property over a long time. There are other kinds of investing and Real Estate is one of them."},{"prompt":"What is the best one liner you have written?","completion":""},{"prompt":"Was Varys actually okay with assassinating Daenerys when Robert ordered it?","completion":"He seemingly had to be “OK” with it in both continuities because there was always at least some chance that it would get pulled off. There was no way to predict ahead of time that Jorah would be with her at that precise moment, or that he’d cotton on to the wine in time, etc. Too many variables were out of Varys’ control for him to not conclude that Dany’s assassination was “acceptable” if it occurred. Yes, he warned Jorah that there would be attempts, but all the same, all it would take was one to work. (And what if Jorah misses getting the warning message?!) Now, if he really wanted her to not be killed, all he had to do was just not hire the assassin in the first place and lie to Robert about the hit being a failure. But the attempt itself served a purpose by galvanizing Drogo to invade Westeros. Varys might have preferred it to fail, but the reward of actually going through with the contract was too big to pass up. Because, hey, maybe if Dany dies, Drogo still tries to invade Westeros to avenge her and Varys gets what he wants anyway. Varys gambled on it, and won (until Drogo died and Dany went off on her own), but he still could have lost and went in knowing that. It was an acceptable risk. He didn’t even warn Jorah of fake “attempts” to get Dany’s paranoia up and get her to appeal to Drogo to invade on that basis. He actually did send someone to kill her. The assassin failed, and maybe nine times out of 10 he fails. But, again, all it takes is that one time. I think it’s also important that at the time the job was discussed and likely at the time it was actually contracted out, Viserys was still alive and was also being targeted. Illyrio and Varys’ fake Aegon plotting (in the books) has shifted in many ways down the line, but it’s clear that Viserys and/or Dany not surviving to invade Westeros at all was a strong possibility — Illyrio tells Tyrion straight up he thought Dany would die with the Dothraki. If the invasion had happened, then the idea was probably to have Viserys/Dany and Robert beat each other up and for fake Aegon to swoop in and knock them both aside. But there was always a chance it wouldn’t happen, and — in Dany’s pre-dragon days — it looks like the Targaryen siblings were acceptable losses. Either Drogo would invade and then get booted out by fake Aegon (likely resulting in both Viserys and Dany being killed or re-exiled, etc.), or Viserys and Dany would go with the Dothraki and never return and be out of Aegon’s hair that way. On the show, Varys’ motivations are all over the map and pretty much take a total U-turn from seasons 1–4 and then seasons 5–8, for no obvious reason other than that without fake Aegon they had to rewrite his plot. Apart from Varys and Illyrio’s cutaway conversation that Arya overhears — which doesn’t make any sense in the grand scheme of things without Aegon’s plot — there’s no reason in the first half of the series that Varys is trying to help Dany. He’s doing intel work for Tywin in Meereen until almost the end of season 4 but then magically three episodes later, with virtually no explanation, he’s decided to throw in with Dany. Hmm."},{"prompt":"Do owners of racing cars (Lamborghini, Audi, Ferrari, Porsche etc) drive them around every day like when going for shopping or when going at work? Do they always have to watch their cars when parked in public to not get scratched/damaged by someone?","completion":"I drive a Porsche Macan and its my daily driver so used for shopping, work etc. I think the novelty wears off - I parked in a really tight spot once at a restaurant and it was on my mind through lunch so I eventually went to move it. That said, I’m not watching it in public or even gunning or racing it on the street but that might be because I’m middle-aged: I really bought it for the driving experience, not for speed - I have a motorcycle for that (which I also dont race anyway because its a cruiser, not a sports bike). I also park my Macan on the street by the way - no private parking pads where I live, and treat it exactly like I treat my Civic. All that said, not all “racing cars” are practical daily drivers. The Macan is a mini-SUV and most Porsche owners have a Macan as daily driver and another fancier one for weekend/good weather driving. Most enthusiasts will tell you not to let these cars sit though - they are made to be driven, so drive them as often as you can. besides, they’re fun to drive so why have them sitting?"},{"prompt":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","completion":"They are to the right of what Republicans used to be."},{"prompt":"What is the strangest thing you have seen that is very common in a culture outside of your own?","completion":"In every culture, there are certain things that are considered normal or commonplace. However, what one culture finds normal may be strange or even bizarre to another. Here are some of the strangest things that are actually quite common in other cultures around the world. In many parts of Africa, it is not uncommon to see people with lip plates. These are large discs made from wood, bone, or clay that are inserted into a person's lower lip, stretching it out over time. The size of the lip plate can vary depending on the tribe, but they can often be as big as a dinner plate.

Thank you for asking such a great question about [LINKED_TEXT: sports betting] [URL: https://sportscasinobetting.com/3-betting-tips-for-online-casino/]. As an expert in this field, I can tell you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the key to successful sports betting depends on a variety of factors. However, I can share with you some of the strategies that have helped me personally to be successful in this field. The first thing to keep in mind when it comes to sports betting is that it is a form of gambling, and as such, you need to approach it with a certain level of discipline and caution. This means setting a budget for your bets and sticking to it, and avoiding the temptation to chase losses by placing larger bets than you can afford. Additionally, it's important to do your research before placing any bets. This means analyzing the teams or players involved, looking at their past performance, and considering factors like injuries or weather conditions that may impact the outcome of the game. When it comes to my personal experience with sports betting, I have found that one of the most important things is to be patient and not rush into making bets without careful consideration. I also like to focus on a few specific sports or teams that I am particularly knowledgeable about, rather than trying to spread myself too thin and bet on everything. Finally, it's important to remember that there will always be some level of risk involved in sports betting, and that even the most successful bettors experience losses from time to time. With that in mind, it's important to stay level-headed and not let emotions cloud your judgment when making bets."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Self- confidence comes with knowledge, faith in self and self capability and a bold determination.

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the monitor, keyboard, CPU, memory, and hard drive. These are tangible components that you can see and touch. On the other hand, software refers to the programs and applications that run on the hardware components of a computer system. Software is intangible and includes the operating system, productivity software, games, and more. However, some components can be classified as both hardware and software. For example, firmware is a type of software that is embedded in hardware components such as the BIOS chip on a motherboard or the firmware in a router. These components contain software that is used to control the hardware and perform specific functions. So, while they are hardware components, they also contain software."},{"prompt":"bujjima a Tamil word?

Meanings of English words ‘little, cute, pretty, love, affection, caressing and fondling are mindedly linked to this expression ‘Bujji-బుజ్జి’. This ‘Bujji’ has variations like ‘bujjimA-బుజ్జిమా’, bujjamma-బుజ్జమ్మ’ and ‘bujjavva’-బుజ్జవ్వ’. This expression is totally slang and hence do not search for it in standard Telugu dictionaries.

I dont feel older, and I'm not sure if I look it. I'm a bit faster and stronger than I was then, and it seems I've added a couple new scars (and the side of my face where I took a surfboard to the temple has softened out a little maybe? Hard to tell from the lighting difference). The big changes really started in 2009 when I started running, but there was a significant metamorphosis that happened to me internally when I progressed from being a casual running trying lose weight and a consistent runner that really loves the act of running itself. I think that would be about age 33–34… It's easier for me to let things go, not worry about how certain things will turn out, and in general I feel less stressed even though my work load has probably doubled in that time. Fundamentally I think my dreams are the same, which surprises me. I approach them more pragmatically now, as well as spend less time thinking them through and planning them. I'm much more prone to just getting started on a project without really considering if it's even feasible. I'm more open, social, and comfortable with myself. I have no idea where that comes from, but I hear that happens to a lot of people in their thirties, maybe by now we are just better at knowing who were are and accepting that it won't change very much, but that who were are is just fine even if we didn't think so when we were younger? I've lost most of my sense of cynicism: it just isn't useful, and I realized it's nothing but a safe place to hide because it's impossible to be wrong when being cynical. My day job is far less rewarding, but I've invested more in my volunteer time. A lot has happened to me during this: travel, great and terrible things, and friends that I didn't expect to outlive- lost them so young.

Mainly all the food is cooked without garlic and onion but because of the influence of other cuisines, these ingredients are now used in some of the dishes. The best place to have Kashmiri food is at a Kashmiri's place (or try to cook it yourself). I have tried many restaurants claiming to serve 'authentic' kashmiri cuisine- huge disappointment (and anger, frustration, forget it!) Here are some of the dishes that you should try if you're new to the cuisine. Vegetarian Chhok nadur (lotus stem- sour)Monjjyi haakh (kohlrabi) cooked in Mustard oil with salt, red chillies and asafetida is one of the simplest dishes to make. The best way to have monjjyi haakh is to have it with hot rice and curd.Chhok vaangun (Sour brinjal)Raazma and Kali chaaman (kidney beans with yellow cottage cheese on the side) well, I know technically these are two dishes but they complement each other so well that one is not cooked without another.Nadur yakkhinyi (to put it in simple words, this is lotus stem cooked in curd and a lot of masalas) MY PERSONAL FAVORITE. I CAN HAVE THIS EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE Other dishes that you can try are All hacchyi wangan hacchyi, damaaloo and all Rogan Josh (veg). Oh btw, by ‘all' I mean अल- bottle gourd and pumpkin. Coming to the non vegetarian dishes. It's painful to think about them, knowing that I won't be able to have them in four months till I get home… nevermind 1. ROGANJOSH (goat meat or lamb) it's red hot and spicy.. juices flowing from the meat.. a hint of cardomom… a hit of red chillies… BRB. 2. Charvan chaagul oloo (Liver and goat testicles cooked with potatoes) 3. All syunn (Pumpkin and meat) 4. Kali (yellow mutton) have it if you don't want anything spicy but are craving for meat. Pair it up with some curd on the side and you'll lose it!! 5. Chhok charvan (sour liver) now this is not a dish-dish. But it's served on the side. 6. Tabakh maaz (lamb ribs) again, this is usually served before or after a meal. The ribs are slowly cooked in a broth till they absorb all the spices and flavors. Later, fried in ghee. THE BEST OF ALL THE WORLDS. You can also try yakkhinyi (meat cooked in curd), syunn khyachar (khichdi and meat) and gaad (red hot fish) Hope was able to help you! Enjoy!"},{"prompt":"What makes private schools better than public schools as far as getting a child ready for college?","completion":"Others have noted that private schools can choose their students. This is true, but incomplete. Many private schools select for highly motivated students who are the children of highly educated parents. At my children's K-12 prep school, about 30% had an MD as a parent. Almost all the parents had at least a bachelor’s degree and many had other advanced degrees. A better comparison is between private school students and public school students who are themselves highly motivated and the children of highly educated parents. Private schools can focus on these students and can have the flexibility to accommodate a broader range of aptitudes. In many private schools, the faculty is aware that the aim of the majority of their students is admission to a highly selective college. The “average” student will be headed for a college ranked around 25th in USNews&WR. The top quarter, or so, will be competitive at the colleges ranked in the top 15’s including the usual suspects - Ivy League, Duke, Stanford, Williams, Pomona, etc. Some students show their aptitudes early - even in kindergarten. At private schools, they can be kept motivated. At my children’s school, a 3rd-grader in my son’s class was given “challenge problems” in math to keep him interested. In many respects, his math ability was greater than that of his lower school teachers. How many third-graders figure out decimals, fractions, exponents and sums of finite series on their own? Later, his teachers agreed to first skip him a class and then to a Summer tutorial in pre-Calculus so that he could take Calculus in 10th grade. Two years behind, another boy used the older boy’s achievements as his benchmark (the younger boy went to MIT where he began taking graduate-level courses his Sophomore year). In certain advanced courses, a class might have only one or two students. Few public schools could devote the resources to this kind of specialization. At my children’s school, a new Headmaster complained that the school was teaching too many college level courses! The Seniors in the upper quarter typically were taking mostly AP courses. Out of 44 total students in one class, 12 took the Calculus BC curriculum having already completed Calculus AB before Senior year. Only two students took Latin IV. Both were very, very good. They had a spirited competition. Their teacher could keep shoveling more and more material at them. One went to CMU to study Computwr Science. The other, to Princeton for pre med. The Princeton student took upper division electives in Latin Freshman year in order to have some easy courses! A program like this is not for everyone. There is a dark side to it. Some students feel parental pressure to achieve when they just don’t have the aptitude or motivation. One student really, really wanted to go to Yale, her father’s Alma mater. She came up a bit short. She graduated from Tufts - one of the finest colleges in the country but not Yale. For most students, Tufts would have been a dream.

Will Smith hit Chris because Chris had supposedly insulted his wife. What was the insult? Chris called her G.I Jane. Why? Because she had shaved her head bald like a soldier. Duh! We live in a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-generational world where some women wear dresses and some wear pants. Some men do the same thing although dresses are rare. A bass player in a local band does. So what? We’re supposed to be adults. Jokes about our dress and personal appearance are common if we get too far out of the common fashion norm. Some guys wear long hair and still there are those who joke about it. Women shaving themselves bald is still a very new fashion at least in the western world. They should expect some lighthearted ribbing. And be adult about. Please note Chris didn’t threaten Jada’s life or try to cause her harm. If Jada found Chris’s comment too insulting she should have been a courageous woman about it and walked up to Chris and slapped him herself. Having Will do it and not even bothering to try to stop him harkens to the same pathetic Karen behavior attributed to some entitled assuming white women. That’s the real disgrace.

For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer.","completion":"I’m a big guy (6’2”, about 200 lbs. when I was on the street), and that no doubt saved me from being in more fights. That’s a good thing, because I’m not a great fighter. If I anticipated I was going to have to arrest someone that appeared to be a fighter, I’d start backup rolling toward me. If you have two or more officers present, you can often avoid a fight, as the ultimate outcome is evident. This might not be true if you were taking on Chuck Norris, but fortunately Chuck is pretty pro-police. It’s interesting that having multiple officers attend a call is a magnet for criticism, as it was at the recent incident with the trespassing arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia. I’ve read several critical accounts where the police were accused of escalating the situation by having half a dozen cops there. Consider how much worse this would have been, had there been one cop to confront two men, and one of them started to fight. The cops who have been rolling to assist would not have been cool, calm, and collected in their response. We had a radio code (that I will not divulge here for operational security reasons) that meant, “I need one, and only one, cover unit, but I need it as quickly as possible.” This kept dispatch from sending the entire watch rolling to your aid, but ensured you would get that additional presence quickly. That was really handy when radio just told me that the guy I was talking to had an active arrest warrant, and I thought there might be a row in my immediate future. I had a few would-be resisters look me over and say, with some bravado, “I can kick your ass.” My usual reply was something like this: “You might just be able to do that. I’m not all that tough. But you need to consider the two dozen crazy boys in blue uniforms who will be coming over the hill after me, intent on making you the project of the day. If that happens, it will suck to be you.” Once the street fighter had been assured that he was badder than me, he didn’t need to prove it as often. Some people are just going to fight. Occasionally, this happens when they are told they’re going to jail, even though they have been calm up to that point. I don’t have the clip available, but I saw an example of this on an episode of COPS I was watching two nights ago. An officer stopped a man who had been riding a bicycle (I don’t recall the reason for the stop). The officer patted him down for weapons, found none, and started conducting his field interview. When radio came back that he had an active warrant, he told the suspect, and the suspect’s demeanor changed immediately. “I DON’T HAVE A WARRANT! I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL!” He swung on the officer, then started to run (“rabbit”). The suspect was slightly larger than the officer, but the officer had assistance already on scene. The suspect was arrested after a short foot pursuit and wrestling match. It was a classic “rabbit fever” incident, where everything is fine until someone says the J-word. De-escalation techniques work only with rational people. You have to be able to reason with someone to de-escalate, and some people are incapable of reason because of alcohol or drug intoxication, mental illness, or emotional trauma. The police have little choice in who they confront. The officer on scene doesn’t have the option of saying, “I’m not taking this call. He’s too crazy for me.” A police career means signing up to handle whatever comes over the radio or data terminal. The next call might be a report on a stolen bicycle, or shots fired at the local high school. If that kind of variety appeals to you, then you might enjoy being a cop. If it’s terrifying, then maybe you want to try something else."},{"prompt":"What is social media listening?","completion":"Yes, social media marketing can really help your business.

While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, let's explore some relatable ways to approach investing that can help you navigate this exciting journey. Knowledge is Power: Before diving headfirst into investments, take the time to educate yourself. Explore various investment options, understand their risks and potential returns, and grasp the basic principles of diversification. Resources such as books, online courses, and reputable financial websites can empower you with the knowledge needed to make informed investment decisions.Define Your Goals: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals and time horizon. Are you investing for retirement, a down payment on a house, or your child's education? Clarifying your objectives will help shape your investment approach. Long-term goals may warrant a more aggressive investment strategy, while short-term goals may require a conservative approach to protect your principal.Diversification: The age-old saying \\"don't put all your eggs in one basket\\" holds true in the world of investments. Diversification involves spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions to mitigate risk. By diversifying your portfolio, you reduce the impact of a single investment's performance on your overall wealth, increasing the potential for stable, long-term returns.Consider Index Funds and ETFs: For those who prefer a hands-off approach, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a simple and cost-effective way to invest. These funds pool money from multiple investors to track a specific index, such as the S&P 500. With broad market exposure, index funds and ETFs offer diversification and typically have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds.Seek Professional Advice: If you find yourself overwhelmed or lacking the time to manage investments on your own, consulting with [LINKED_TEXT: professional debt collector] [URL: https://www.qade.co/post/how-qade-helps-clients-maximize-recovery-rates] can provide valuable guidance. A professional can assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals to tailor an investment strategy that suits your needs. However, it's crucial to choose a reputable advisor who operates in your best interest and aligns with your investment philosophy.Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires patience, discipline, and a long-term perspective. Historically, the stock market has demonstrated growth over extended periods, despite short-term fluctuations. By staying focused on your goals and avoiding impulsive reactions to market volatility, you increase your chances of reaping the benefits of long-term investment growth.Stay Informed and Adjust: Regularly monitor your investments, stay informed about market trends, and periodically reassess your portfolio's performance and allocation. As your circumstances and goals evolve, it may be necessary to rebalance your portfolio or make adjustments to align with your changing needs. Remember, investing involves risk, and there are no guaranteed returns. What works for one person may not work for another, so it's crucial to understand your risk tolerance, do your due diligence, and seek advice as needed. Ultimately, the best ways to invest money depend on your individual circumstances, goals, and comfort level. By arming yourself with knowledge, diversifying your portfolio, and staying disciplined, you can navigate the investment landscape with confidence and increase the likelihood of achieving your financial aspirations."},{"prompt":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","completion":"Yes, for two reasons: He was one of the (not so many) local rulers that dared to fight the Ottoman Empire.

This story influenced me greatly after reading the book, and I always refer to it whenever I face a difficult situation dealing with people: The story goes like this: One of the first people in corporate America to earn a million dollars a year in the early 1900s was Charles Schwab. This is the time when a person earning 50 a week was considered well off. He had been handpicked by Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate, as the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921. Schwab was only thirty-eight at the time. Why did Andrew Carnegie pay Charles Schwab one million dollars a year? Schwab was not a genius. Schwab was not smarter than other people in the company. In fact, there were smarter people in the company than him. Certainly, Schwab did not know more about manufacturing than other people. In fact, Schwab had many people working for him, who knew more about manufacturing than he did. So, what is it that was so special about Charles Schwab? Charles Schwab was paid a million dollars a year because of his uncanny ability to deal with people. The phenomenal growth of United States Steel Company in the early 1920s was attributed to Charles Schwab. Employees, from the janitor to top executives, liked him, he ate with them, and called them by their first names. They also called him by his first name. Employees felt as if they were part of the company. Productivity was said to go up 2x and even 3x without any extra spending. When asked how he did it, this is what he had to say in his own words; words that ought to be cast in bronze and hanged in every home, school, shop and office. Words that every child and adult should learn. Words that can transform your life and mine. “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among people, the greatest asset I posses, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.” “There is nothing else that so kills the ambition of a person, as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise, but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” “In my wide association in life, meeting with many people in various parts of the world, I have yet to find the person, however great or small, who will not do better work, and put forth greater effort, under a spirit of approval than he/she would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”"},{"prompt":"Could you recommend a math book that contains a lot of problems?

Let's take a look at some of them. CRM system Given that inside sales are remote, sales reps usually rely on internet and telephone. They spend most of the time checking in with the existing clients, talking to prospects, or looking for leads. It’s really easy to get lost in all that information. That's why you need a solid CRM system. It’s helpful in many ways, from saving time on manual data entry to keeping client data in order. Call center software Call center software enables sales reps to spend most of their time talking rather than doing routine activities such as dialing, redialing, staying on the line until someone picks up, leaving voice messages, etc. Ideally, you need a call center software that has a built-in CRM system.

The more you know about potential clients, the easier it will be to convert them. Email tracking software Having a large list of leads is great but how do you make sure you’ve reached them? Email tracking software allows inside sales teams to see whether prospects open their emails and provides other valuable insights regarding the success of an email campaign. Useful apps for communication Sales are not solely about the customers. It’s very important to make sure that the whole team is working in sync, that everybody knows what they are doing and why they are doing it. That’s why maintaining an effective communication between the team members is so important. The software should allow you to do more than calling and messaging. Also, efficient communication software is a must for a remote team. Of course, there are many other tools that can boost the productivity of your sales department.

German Shepherds have a particularly strong sense of loyalty. They would protect not only their owners, but also all their family members in the household. The strong sense of loyalty and protective instinct make German Shepherds a good guard dog. Most dogs you've formed a bond with will show excitement when seeing you after a while of being apart. German Shepherds are especially known for this. They may jump up at you, lick your face, and run around aimlessly at your presence. They may even whine from their inability to contain their excitement. Disclaimer: Go To See My Profile. You can discover about German Shepherd stuff there!"},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"Technically it was the british that inspired the 2A, and the fear of standing tyrannical armies that were generally armed assholes and invaded homes and took what they wanted. Read the 3A, it will give you some ideas of what they were thinking about when they were writing the 2A. As a side note, I am pretty sure if we could go backward in a time machine, the native americans would have preferred to have been better armed. Our government does not exactly have a track record of being very trustworthy."},{"prompt":"What is the importance of fire safety in your home?","completion":"Fire safety begins at home.Every family should know the basics of how to prevent fires at home and what to do in case there is a fire.The most effective way to protect yourself and your home from the fires to identify and remove fire hazards. 60% of house fire deaths occur in homes with no working smoke alarms.

We must all take responsibility to reduce our individual carbon footprints, support green initiatives, and engage in the public discourse to ensure that our elected leaders are taking meaningful action to address climate change."},{"prompt":"Why should we plant more trees if forests are fuel for wildfires and could end up adding more CO2 to the atmosphere than say, the deserts?","completion":"Please tell me this a QPP or troll question and not serious. I mean even only half sleeping through 8th grade Earth Science should have given you this information. “Trees also store carbon dioxide in their fibers helping to clean the air and reduce the negative effects that this CO2 could have had on our environment. According to the [LINKED_TEXT: Arbor Day Foundation] [URL: http://www.arborday.org/trees/treefacts/], in one year a mature tree will absorb more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in exchange.” “Through a process called photosynthesis, leaves pull in carbon dioxide and water and use the energy of the sun to convert this into chemical compounds such as sugars that feed the tree. But as a by-product of that chemical reaction oxygen is produced and released by the tree. It is proposed that one large tree can provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to four people.” [LINKED_TEXT: The Power of One Tree - The Very Air We BreatheThe second in a series of blogs honoring the United Nation’s 2015 International Day of Forests On Saturday, March 21, the U.S. Forest Service will celebrate the United Nation’s International Day of Forests. With such an important worldwide recognition of all forests do for us humans, the Forest Service would like folks to ask themselves: Do I really know how much trees contribute to my daily life? Or, in another words, what is the power of one tree?

If you are racist, and I don't mean the actual “woke” or leftist kind of racist, but actually someone who want to see the non white fail, you must support the idea that maths is racist. Students who believe that there are no objectives answers in mathematics, or are thought the Aztec mathematical system that is based on 20 instead of 10, are doom. Who will let them build a bridge or a plane with their black or anti-racist mathematics? \\"The concept of mathematics being purely objective is unequivocally false, and teaching it is even much less so,\\" the document for the \\"Equitable Math\\" toolkit states. \\"Upholding the idea that there are always right and wrong answers perpetuate objectivity as well as fear of open conflict.” Yes, it is very important for a white supremacist that non whites believe that. So they becomes pariahs of society. Or that they use a mathematics bases on 20 or 8, so they can not communicate with the rest of society in and out of the states. Do you want them to ban them from STEM and high salaries, follow that program. Any white supremacist must support that teaching for the non whites… I have to wonder if those who came with that idea are white supremacist or just deluded. Sadistic support the idea that Asian are much better at math than white (and that they have higher salaries, but that’s another story). Do the white complain about it? No, because they know they have to study harder and longer, since white are as capable. They know is their responsibility and they are not looking around to blame someone else for their limitation or actions. The other idea that has to come from a white supremacist is “cultural appropriation”. It is an excellent way to ensure that minorities culture vanish and the dominant culture prevails."},{"prompt":"Can I see a picture of your dog?","completion":"Sure!

So, I’ve compiled a list of 7 out of the box USA startups that are actually nailing it in different industrial sectors. 1. Front (Artificial Intelligence Sector) This 79M million company from San Fransisco has been around for five years. Its focus is on changing the way teams work by creating a shared-inbox platform. This app allows teams to manage incoming messages in the easiest and simplest way possible. Think of it as a better version of apps like Slack. 2. DecorMatters (Augmented Reality – AR Sector) This California based company created an app that makes buying home decoration products online an exciting and easy experience. Just by using the app with your smartphone, you can see how the products you wish to buy will fit in with your space. All you need is access to your smartphone’s camera on the app. Using “computer vision and image recognition technology,” potential clients can see, beforehand, how a piece of furniture will complete their homes. This 1.5 million free app is “based on a patent-pending AR technology.” Their app is rated 4.5+ by users. Speaking about this startup Discover.Luxury said: “DecorMatters is perfect for both the novice and design expert.” It’s similar to Room Planner – Design Home 3D, however, they have a lower rating of 4.4. 3. Bundil (Cryptocurrency Sector) Bundil jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon after receiving 100,000 worth of funding from Kevin O’Leary after the creators appeared on The Shark Tank. Dimitry Love came up with the idea when he became inundated with questions from his family about how to invest in cryptocurrency. People who use their services are able to automatically invest their spare monies from their credit or debit card purchases. They can buy into a number of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin, and Bitcoin Cash. 4. Grail (Medical and Healthcare Sector) This unique business received 1.6 billion from Hillhouse Capital Group showing that the idea was gold. The 2015 startup came up with solutions to diagnose cancer-related problems at an early stage. Even China has backed this startup by investing largely in their idea. How much money the company makes remains to be seen as cancer research is ongoing. 5. Welcome Beyond (Travel Sector) A great number of people are reluctant to travel all because they don’t know where to stay, how to book, and so forth. Yes, we already have Airbnb, but what makes this startup different is that with it you can handpick hotels. Welcome Beyond doesn’t just choose the mainstream locations, they only pick those that are truly exotic. Their main aim is to provide “a refreshing and soothing environment to the guests.” 6. Heliocor (FinTech Sector) They’ve already received 2.5 million funding. Helicor’s big idea is to help online business, e-commerce stores, and apps to be GDPR-compliant for online privacy. This regulatory, technology and consulting startup allows these companies to be “compliant of the laws of the state, fraud detection, and prevention.” 7. Aceable (Education Sector) Sageview Capital funded this idea with 55 million. This app helps you become a learner driver and when you qualify and pass the license is delivered at your home. However, you still need to take the driving test to receive your license. What makes this app great is that people who can’t attend driving classes physically are spared the stress. It has a 4.9 rating and is slightly similar to DMV Genie Permit Practice Test app but with more features. The USA startups listed above offer a fresh approach in a number of different sectors. Some are similar to others you might know but their approach makes them stand out from the competitors."},{"prompt":"Why should we plant more trees if forests are fuel for wildfires and could end up adding more CO2 to the atmosphere than say, the deserts?","completion":"Trees take CO2 out of the atmosphere to grow. When they die or are burned, the CO2 is returned to the atmosphere, so they don’t add any. Long buried coal, oil, and methane add CO2 to the atmosphere and the excess takes hundreds to many thousands of years to be removed."},{"prompt":"kylie jenner really a billionaire?","completion":"To some people, Kylie Jenner is still a billionaire, but according to Forbes, she is no longer a billionaire."},{"prompt":"Who was at the top, Kishore Kumar or Mohammed Rafi?","completion":"Hey, I cannot say about who was more popular but as i have heard so many songs of both my conclusion is the time when Late Sh.

This includes developing his own staff.Has a track record of helping clients successfully, including clients that I know and respect.Has a track record of successfully building and managing his own portfolio.Charges on a fee only basis or a percentage of assets under management.Is able to generate confidence by his or her clients, especially me.There should also be the right chemistry between the client and advisor.

If the time comes when embryos can be transferred to men to incubate and birth from some natural or engineered opening, sure, they can have the embryo and raise it himself. Women are not factories. People should have realistic expectations and discussions before unprotected sexual intercourse happens."},{"prompt":"Why does the UK want the Scilly Islands?

These are called rogue planets. So far we have found only a couple of them - and most of them are only candidates (meaning, their finding or their mass has not yet been confirmed). Finding and studying these objects is extremely difficult, as they do not emit any light and are terrible tiny. The only ways to identify them is via microlensing or via direct imaging - the latter is only possible for large and nearby ones. From the rogue planets we have found so far we estimate that there are between two and 100,000 rogue planets for every star in the Milky Way."},{"prompt":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","completion":"No,.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","completion":"I never had a trauma bond because I never had any kind of bond with my abusive parents. They never left any doubt that they didn’t love me at all. So I never loved them. I even tried to force myself to love them because religion said that I must, but I failed doing so, and then I left religion, too, as I would never be able to fulfill my duties anyway. I simply know that they are mentally ill, utterly selfish, irresponsible, unreliable, immoral, amoral, lacking any empathy. I know that I am defective and that it ight have “caused” them to behave this way (I have Aspergers), but having a disabled child is a risk everyone takes once you decide to have children, so it’s their fault, not mine, and as adults they should be able to face the consequences and take responsibility for their choices, not dump all their frustrations on a child who has never asked to be born and has no control about her disability. If you can’t live up to your responsibilities, don’t have children. It’s that simple. Get a pet or a realistic doll instead, or accept that you lack the ability to have children. The same goes for any abusive partner. Can’t stand your partner, say goodbye and both take their own paths. Keeping a partner in captivity so that you can punish him/her for whatever he/she does that you dislike makes no sense. There is simply no excuse for abuse."},{"prompt":"What is a dofollow backlink?","completion":"Both links are the ones used for link-building strategies.

Competition to score higher In olden days, scoring 60% was decent. But now, even scoring 95% is not enough. Hence, most of the childhood get lost in studying, rote learning and trying to score maximum max. Plus, the syllabus is ever increasing and it increases pressure on children to study multiple subjects and perform well in exams. Not satisfied with what they have In olden days, people used to be happy even for smaller things like getting a toffee, or going to gardens or beach. However, this generation is never satisfied with what they have. The demand for materialistic things have risen substantially. A person having Rs 20K phone is unhappy about not having Rs 50K phone whereas a person having Rs 50K phone is not happy for not having Rs 100K phone. Too much expectations from life In olden days, people had less expectations from life. But present people have too much expectations from life and when the reality hits hard, they become disappointed. However, life is not a fairy tale. Competing with others Competition is not limited to academics and job promotions. Competition occurs in all aspects. For instance, if your friend is earning better than you, you will be unhappy and strive for it, if you cousin is settled abroad, you also want to do the same, if you relatives have better standard of living, you will also want the same. Too much attachment to materialistic things and disconnection with human beings While things like phone, laptops and other technology have bought people closer virtually, it has resulted in disconnect between human beings. Most people prefer to meet virtually rather than meet in person. Hence, people feel lonely. However, there are exceptions i.e. some people are still happy with being lonely. Lack of patience Due to advanced technology, everything has become easier, No need to stand in queues to pay bill, no need to wait for days for message from post mail, No need to go out and buy groceries, Everything happens at fingertips. Hence, today’s generation expects fast service and when it is not fulfilled, they become disappointed and frustrated. Comparing oneself with others and low self esteem Today’s generation tend to compare themselves to other more than the older generations. They compare their beauties, Body shape, money, lifestyle and everything with others. And when they don’t achieve this, their self esteem gets lowered."},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","completion":"No, I do not. I think Karma and the concept of it for the most part is very dogmatic and most modern “new age” concepts of karma are very bastardized. If you look into Hinduism the word refers to “action\\" and Karma Phala refers to those reactions or consequences of said actions. That being said, I don't believe in most (or any) Hinduism concepts either but I think its interesting nonetheless. Someone should want to be a good person regardless of whether or not there is some magical force keeping him/her in line. It should be a matter of personal values and principles and not because a supernatural force told you too. Furthermore, I think what most Wiccans and Pagans tell you about Karma is utter horseshit, but that's just my opinion. I think If “magic” (which is just energy btw) and karma exists like they say that it does, then it wouldn't think like a human and judge like a human does. I don't believe that the universe is that biased. We as humans rationalize, personify, and attach human-made concepts to things that are not people."},{"prompt":"What are the three components of the cell theory?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Jay Gohil (@jaygohil803) • Instagram photos and videos318 Followers, 196 Following, 2 Posts - See Instagram photos and videos from Jay Gohil (@jaygohil803)https://instagram.com/jaygohil803?utm_source=qr&igshid=ZDc4ODBmNjlmNQ%3D%3D] [URL: https://instagram.com/jaygohil803?utm_source=qr&igshid=ZDc4ODBmNjlmNQ%3D%3D]Follow On Instagram 😊.

First of all, one of the challenges of adolescence is learning respect, so that would be the U.S. Justice Department having words with the State of Missouri, i.e. one of the 50 states. The state, or rather a gaggle of mouthy “I’m a Right Winga’ politicos” are going to preen for the cameras and the Mama-adjacents to their hearts content, at which point in time they will hear from local police and sheriffs’ departments, mayors and others that federal funding is being risked by their antics. The map of alleged sovereign states is interesting but I’ll believe something is up when one, just one, of those states decides to spit back up the federal milk money they have so happily accepted like mana from heaven.

I just made it out of RTC (Navy boot camp) at the end of April, so I was there during the development of the whole CoronaCrisis, as we called it. This led to some rather interesting stories… A common cadence sung as we marched goes like this: He-ere we go again, Same old song again Marching down the avenue, ___ more weeks and we’ll be through… You can listen to a similar version here: At this point, we’d made it through all of what boot camp had to offer, picked up our orders, and were desperately ready to get out of there; we’d sung the song all the way down to two days! Unfortunately, we’d been surprise-quarantined for two weeks after Battle Stations, and it didn’t seem as if anyone knew what was going on, when we’d leave, what the rules were, or anything, really. We were stuck in a depressing limbo of having nothing to do all day every day, but still having to abide by all the strict regulations. Then, as we were marching back to the compartment one night, our cadence-caller (AROC) let loose an interesting variation: He-ere we go again, Same old song again Marching down the avenue, who the f*** knows when we’ll be through… Also after quarantine and Battle Stations, the RDCs started to relax some rules and let us have some fun. While we marched, we always had four “road guards” who wore orange vests and, when called, ran ahead of the formation to stand in the road to block traffic. Our chief had read through the Red Book (boot camp bible for RDCs), and discovered there was no proscription against having the road guards Naruto-run ahead of the division. So guess what we did that day. Something we never did but always joked about trying was a Mass Chaos manuever. In a Mass Right, the RPOC yells “Mass…Right!”, the Port Watch yells “Port watch section prepare to halt”, and the Starboard Watch yells “Starboard section column half right”, followed by the RPOC’s “March!”, when the front half of the formation stops and the back half goes around them so the formation is twice as wide and half as long. Well, in a Mass Chaos, you hear this instead: “Mass…Chaos!” “Port watch section prepare to scream!” “Starboard section prepare to sprint!” “Charge!” That was followed by everyone breaking up, sprinting randomly around and screaming, then forming back up into ranks as if nothing unusual had happened. We were promised we’d do it one night, but quarantine interrupted our plans. I was one of the robot recruits, highly dedicated to getting through boot camp without getting beat (ordered to do a series of painful exercises) at all. I’d managed to perfect my military bearing, neutral tone, and everything else, to a degree that sometimes surprised the RDCs. Petty Officer Pham and I had a running joke about this: he’d call over RDCs from other divisions, call me forward, and ask if I ever felt emotions. My response was always the same: “Petty Officer, I allow myself five minutes of emotion every day while brushing my teeth, Petty Officer!” Another RDC would stop me in the p-way (hallway) whenever he saw me and ask “Recruit, do you know what I’m going to say to you?” “Yes, Petty Officer.” “You have an elevator voice, recruit. Carry on.” As Port Watch, I had a bunch of divisional paperwork to do daily. Once, an RDC caught an error on there and asked me in a deadpan tone if I was trying to make her cry. No, Petty Officer! This one is much, much funnier in retrospect. After some divisional goofing off, we did bunk makeup drills - tearing the sheets and blanket off your bed, crumpling them up, then remaking your bed, all done to precise standards, in set times, and in a very particular way. Because the division had been acting childish, the RDC overseeing this put on some music. Just imagine listening to this on repeat for an hour while making a bed over and over again: I nearly had a PTSD attack listening to five seconds of this to confirm it was the right video. Many of the instructors will try to make you laugh; after all, it’s a lot easier to remember something funny. Our first aid instructor told us that he’d be showing some graphic images, so if we needed to puke, we should turn to the recruit behind us and point to our mouths so they could hold open their blouse to receive it. Later in the presentation, we got to hear about the basic 11 wounds, along with his very memorable foodlike descriptions. We learned how to avoid eyeball soup, make a guts taco, and prevent a fracture hamburger. No one left the class with any sort of appetite."},{"prompt":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Mission To Crack Government Exams's Space · September 29, 2021Answer is : 8+11+21=40https://qr.ae/pGJhyy] [URL: https://qr.ae/pGJhyy]"},{"prompt":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","completion":"Korea’s ssam meal.

You will be creating a knowledge base for how to operate and maintain a property. If you hire it out from the start, you may lack some of the knowledge needed to truly vet a good contractor out. It is also valuable in creating a solid rental. The more you know about each property's quirks, the better. After you have a good working knowledge and solid cash flow, it will make sense to hire certain things out. There are tax advantages to hiring a pro as well.

The primary goal was for both spacecraft to visit and explore Jupiter and Saturn. A secondary goal was for Voyager 2 to visit Uranus and Neptune, if the primary mission goals were met. After the Voyager spacecraft completed their primary and secondary missions they were going too fast to remain in the solar system, so they became interstellar spacecraft which was an added bonus, as Voyager gave us an opportunity to find out how far the magnetic field of the Sun reaches."},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"I think while many other computer manufacturers have started making laptops with touch screens, Apple has yet to incorporate touch screen technology into their MacBook lineup. There can be a few reasons, Apple believes that the primary input method for macs should be the keyboard and trackpad, which provide a more precise and comfortable experience than touch screens. Adding touch screen technology would add cost and complexity to the manufacturing process which could drive up the price of Macs. Apple has focused on other features and innovations like the touch bar which provide new ways to interact with the MacBook without requiring a touch screen. However, Apple is always exploring new technologies and may eventually decide to add touch screens to their Macs in the future."},{"prompt":"Why doesn't PETA advocate ProLife causes?","completion":"Because they focus on protecting actual living individuals not eggs and sperm and unborn fetuses that could potentially one day become an actual living individual."},{"prompt":"Did beards go out of style in Western countries at the turn of the 20th century?","completion":"Not really, it went out of popularity a little bit after World War 1 (1914–1918) started.

Regardless of your caste, creed, gender, or economic background, Mumbai can provide you with respect and happiness. There are many cities in the world where one goes for work or just to explore and return to their city with a lot of memories which they cherish for a few days or even weeks to come before they forget about it and get back to their daily routine but once someone comes to the city of dreams, even if it’s for a few days, that person can never truly leave the city. It's as if a part of them hasn't and doesn't want to leave the city!! People who actually live in Mumbai never complain about the humidity, pollution, uninvited rains, small apartment sizes, traffic, endless rush, local trains. That’s the job of a person who has just moved to the city and/or has never lived in the city. The list of all the things I adore about the city is, unsurprisingly, rather large, but there are a handful of things that are particularly dear to me. Here are those things in no particular order. LOCAL TRAINS courtesy:- mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com How much I love and miss this sight!! Fun fact:- In 2016, Railway officials hired surveyors to travel in local trains and count passengers, the number was believed to be around 80 lakhs per day!! That is more than five times the population of Estonia, ten times the population of Bhutan, and just a little less than the population of Switzerland. However, this is merely a number for someone who needs to catch the train he’s supposed to, to avoid being late for school, college, or work. Yes, Local trains are crowded, and sometimes you would think that it’s impossible to get in but that’s all from the outside and once you get in, you will find that there’s always room for someone else. Whenever you are running to catch a moving train, there will always be one hand sticking out to pull you in. TRUE STORY!! The kind of things one encounters on a local train is simply quite magical!!

A city which is best known for its Vada pav, Mumbai has many other types of fast food which are just as good. Sardar Pav bhaji (Tardeo), Misal Pav at Aaswad (Dadar), Idli Sambhar at Mysore’s cafe (Matunga), Irani Omelet at Kyani and co. (Marine Lines), Ice cream biscuit at K. Rustom (Churchgate) to name just a few are the most delicious fast food joints in the city.

ALWAYS!! (Remembering one of the greatest headmasters at Hogwarts) It's a fallacy that you have to go to a Gucci or Louis Vuitton store to buy their garments; you can get them for probably 1/100th of the original price on Fashion Street, M.G Road. The level of bargaining that takes place while shopping at Fashion street is truly inspirational. This is generally how conversations are panned out here:- Customer :- Bhaiyya, ye jeans kitne ki di? Shopkeeper:- 1400 rupaye sir/madam. Customer:- 300 mein de rahe ho to bolo!! Shopkeeper:- Nahi parvadta sir/madam. Customer:- Thike Phir rehne do (customer starts walking) 2 seconds later…… Shopkeeper:- Thik hai sir/madam, le jaiye!! Courtesy:- Tripoto.com Even while traveling on a local train, you will see people selling things at a very reasonable price. Believe me, Reasonable doesn’t even begin to describe how cheaply you can get the good stuff (For instance, you can buy earphones for 50 rupees, wallet for 100) courtesy:- Dreamstime.com Yes, the city that never sleeps has some flaws but is there any city out there that accommodates almost 21 million people and is still so awesome. This statement from a well-known English actor neatly summarises my response. The thing about Mumbai is you go five yards and all of human existence is revealed. It's an incredible cavalcade of life, and I love that.” Julian Sands"},{"prompt":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","completion":"Whether investing in cryptocurrencies is worth it depends on several factors, and it's a decision that you should make carefully based on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Here are some key points to consider: 1. High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. Prices can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, which can lead to substantial gains but also substantial losses. If you are not comfortable with this level of volatility, investing in cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for you. 2. Potential Returns: Cryptocurrencies have delivered significant returns for some investors in the past. Bitcoin and some altcoins have seen remarkable price appreciation over the years. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and the market's unpredictable nature means there are no guarantees of continued growth. 3. Diversification: If you already have a well-diversified investment portfolio that includes traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, adding a small portion of cryptocurrencies may provide diversification benefits. However, going all-in on cryptocurrencies could expose you to higher risks. 4. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Consider your investment horizon. Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile in the short term, but some investors believe in their long-term potential. If you are looking for quick profits, be prepared to monitor the market closely and be ready for the potential of significant price swings. 5. Research and Knowledge: Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. Understanding the projects, teams, and communities behind the coins you invest in can help you make more informed decisions. 6. Risk Management: Only invest money you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investments should not jeopardize your financial stability or essential financial goals. 7. Regulatory Environment: Be aware of the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in your country. Some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions or bans on cryptocurrencies, which can impact their adoption and value. It's crucial to approach cryptocurrency investment with caution, do thorough research, and seek advice from financial professionals if needed. If you are uncertain or unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, consider starting with a small amount to gain experience and assess your risk appetite. As with any investment, there are risks involved, and you should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the potential downsides before making a decision.

Bankroll Management: Set aside a specific amount of money for betting, known as your bankroll. It's important to manage your bankroll wisely and avoid placing large bets that could lead to significant losses. Stick to a consistent betting strategy based on your bankroll. 3. Discipline and Patience: Successful sports bettors are disciplined and patient. They don't let emotions or impulsive decisions guide their betting choices. Stick to your research and betting strategy, even during losing streaks, and avoid chasing losses. 4. Utilize Multiple Bookmakers: Comparing odds among different bookmakers can help you find the best value and increase your potential profits. Having accounts with multiple bookmakers gives you more options and flexibility when placing bets. 5. Specialize in Specific Markets: Instead of trying to bet on every sport and market, consider specializing in specific markets or leagues where you have extensive knowledge. This allows you to focus your research and potentially increase your chances of making successful bets. 6. Keep a Record: Maintain a detailed record of your bets, including wins, losses, and the reasoning behind each bet. By tracking your performance, you can identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. 7. Stay Informed: Sports betting is dynamic, with odds constantly changing based on various factors such as injuries, team news, and weather conditions. Stay updated with the latest news and developments that could impact the outcome of a match. Remember, while these tips can improve your chances of success in sports betting, there is still an element of luck involved.

It’s not the only possible interpretation: you may be thinking, for example, about triangles with a particular orientation in the plane. Or triangles with a particular position in the plane. Or in space. But I’ll take what seems to me to be the likeliest meaning: there’s exactly one [math](3,4,5)[/math] triangle, and one [math](5,7.3,10.24)[/math] triangle, and so on. Similarly, a square is determined by the length of its side. That’s a single, positive, real number, in contrast with three positive real numbers satisfying some inequalities, which is what we need to name a triangle. So, in terms of sheer cardinality, the set of triangles and the set of squares have the same cardinality: the cardinality of the continuum. The sets [math]R[/math], [math]R^3[/math] and [math]R^n[/math] for any natural [math]n[/math] have the same cardinality. But… this doesn’t feel right, does it? There are more degrees of freedom in specifying a triangle, so can’t we say that there are more triangles? We sure can. Cardinality isn’t the only way of comparing things. It’s the only way of comparing sets, naked sets with no structure, but “the universe of triangles” doesn’t need to be a naked set. We can reasonably think of the collection of triangles as a manifold, with almost-identical triangles being close together and very-different triangles being far apart. As such, the space of squares can reasonably be modeled by [math]R_{>0}[/math], the positive real numbers, and the space of triangles by some subset of [math]R^3[/math], for example the set [math]displaystyle T ={(a,b,c),mid,ale ble c,,,cle a+b}[/math] Every point in this set corresponds to a triangle, and every triangle corresponds to a point, and triangles which have edges of similar lengths are placed at similar points in [math]T[/math]. With that, we can argue that “squares” is a [math]1[/math]-dimensional manifold, and “triangles” is a [math]3[/math]-dimensional manifold with boundary (or some such thing). And this lets us very justifiably assert that there are way more triangles than squares, and in fact we can even say that there are more triangles than rectangles."},{"prompt":"Can you have different front and rear brake pads?","completion":"you do."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"Without the amenities you're used to, your choice of accommodation might just end up souring the mood of your trip.

The Existence of a Hotel isn't enough to single-handedly boost a region's tourism but they also give out a symptom of health tourism. The growing tourism industry and hospitality industry has emerged as one of the prime growth factors and Hotel business adds much value to it. 7 Factors to Consider When Choosing a Hotel for Business Trips. Check Hotel Reviews. Make sure the hotel you're choosing has a good reputation. Consider Location. The location of the hotel is an important consideration. Dining Options. Consider Hotel Sanitation. Learn About Their Features. Work Space. Leisure Facilities. LOCATION is very important. Emphasize on location as much as you can because it is one of the most important factors when choosing a hotel. The city or countryside, availability of cabs, nearby malls and other tourist attractions are important things when looking for a hotel. Hospitality matters because it feeds the most basic human need that we all have, to feel loved and accepted. That is not something to overlook.

But, having played long scale basses and upright for years, they feel odd to me. My son has a 3/4 scale bass that’s very comfortable to play. I think going smaller than that makes things more difficult, for someone who grew up on the full-sized versions. Weight doesn’t bother me much. A good strap can fix that. And, so long as it’s well balanced, it’s not a big deal."},{"prompt":"What is something that you will never do?","completion":"What is something I will never understand? Behaviour, especially the strange contradictions within each person. Why people prioritize comfort over joy. It seems many spend their lives seeking comfort, stability, and security above all else. But why settle for comfort when you could have joy, wonder, and fulfillment? Life is an adventure meant to be lived fully, not comfortably.The need for conformity. As a non-conformist by nature, I will never understand the desire to blend in and follow the crowd. Why let others dictate who you are and how you should live? Originality and authenticity are far more valuable than conformity.Obsession with image over substance. So many people care more about how they are perceived than who they truly are. They focus on amassing likes, followers, and wealth to boost their image rather than cultivating meaningful relationships and experiences. But image is fleeting, while substance endures.Prioritizing short-term pleasure over long-term happiness. Instant gratification seems to satisfy in the moment but rarely brings lasting fulfillment. Why choose a quick fix when you could take the journey toward deeper and more meaningful happiness?Stubbornness and unwillingness to change. If you're never wrong, you can never learn or grow. Why close yourself off from new perspectives and information that could transform your life for the better? An open mind is a recipe for wisdom.

I’ve done very little family law work, but I would say that, even where love was gone, it was indeed the “lowest” time for all of the spouses. Nobody is normal while they are in a divorce proceeding because of sorrow and/or stress.

So I secretly booked ticket for me #alone so that I could enjoy every single sec of it. When you are in love you are blinded the same goes with me. She has a full control over my phone. Some how she got to know about this but acted as if she don't know. That day: Finally I am going to watch it with no distractions. I made myself comfortable and was only involved in the movie.I barely cared who was beside. You know karma is such a bitch it exactly knows when to hit. After 20min of the movie I heard a strange voice from a lady who was sitting beside me.That voice gave me chills I recollected the voice it was her.

What does it tell the Russians? It tells them the battlefield in Ukraine is going to be deadlier because certain Russian-killers are out there ………somewhere ……….. and Russia doesn’t know where, but will get to fret about them while having to expend a lot of effort finding out. They will be finding out the hard way in their upcoming offensive in the east. Ukraine had had plenty of time to prepare for it. Ukraine’s intelligence has been very good so far, so it should not be surprising if they know Russia’s plans and can set up ambushes. It’s also worth pointing out these are weapons that some Western governments have to be accountable for. Additionally, we do not know all the weapons being sent.

A man who expresses ANY desire to force or coerce a person into continuing a pregnancy against their will is a man who wants to torture another person with more suffering than that man has ever experienced or will ever experience. He is an abusive, cowardly, evil monster. I was raised in the anti-choice movement, and I PROMISE you that such a man WILL abuse your children. Not might. Will. He absolutely, positively, without any exceptions, will display shocking sadism and brutality toward any helpless or dependent beings around him. I have known many, many children of anti-choice fathers. ALL anti-choice men abuse their children. If you don’t understand what I mean, I think the documentary “Shiny Happy People” could be quite illustrative. I was raised by Catholic anti-choicers who had very little social overlap with those people, but were still just like them. And ALL anti-choice men rape their wives. They might not have raped you before marriage, or before children, but once they think they have you fully locked down so you can’t leave, they will start raping you. I was the kind of quiet, curious child about whom adults say things like “little jugs have big ears.” I know what anti-choice wives complain about behind closed doors. ALL anti-choice men rape their wives. So if you ever date a man who says anything about “men should get a say” or “a man should have rights.” that is a confession. He is telling you that he intends to horrifically abuse your children and you. Having an anti-choice father is a fate worse than death. I promise you that it is. If you are pregnant by such a man, please RUN to the nearest abortion provider. Protect yourself. Protect your future children. You and they deserve better than the misery and trauma that such a man will inflict on all of you."},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"I would change that Adam never eat the apple!

The dad looked at me annoyed and said “Easy” To which I replied “He's been talking through the whole movie! “ The douchebag said “He's just a kid!” Five minutes later they left at which point the mother hissed at me.

This is that the big cats are actually part of the last remnant of mega fauna that roamed all continents up until the last ice age. Them - as in: the bulk of said fauna - disappearing, historians dub the Holocene extinction. When I’m talking big cats I am refering to the big five. As in: the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard and snow leopard. And it really is remarkable that they survived. We do not exactly know what caused the extinction event. More specifically, we do not know whether it was due to climate change, disaster, illness, or… men (or a mix of). This last factor (men) is a sinister one because the huge extinction coincides with the rise of Homo sapiens. In short, we cannot say for sure that it was men who took down mammoths, giant bear and deer. And for the matter of big canines: unknown is whether they brought animals like dire wolves to extinction, and perhaps many other big members of the dog family.

In this way, suppose we need to make 100,000 from associate advertising too. In offshoot promoting, we get a commission for items we sell. Suppose the commission rate is 5%. You have to make 10,000 every month or 340 every day dependent on the above counts. To accomplish that one client should purchase an item worth 100 so you get 5 commission. What's more, to make 340 every day, your clients should purchase items worth 7000 every day. Anyway, which one do you believe is more intricate? I think this answers the inquiry very well about how gainful outsourcing business can be. Also, what you ought to do to make it more rewarding for yourself.

Regardless of whether you are utilizing calls to outsource an item, it will be called outsourcing. Along these lines, regardless of whether it is Amazon, eBay, or some other online stage, you can even now begin outsourcing on them. Clearly, all these have a couple of limitations. eBay doesn't permit items from China and clients need to live in the USA. Amazon says that items shouldn't take over seven days to convey. In this way, on the off chance that you can maintain these strategies than you can begin outsourcing on Amazon and eBay also."},{"prompt":"What do you think of PyTorch compared to TensorFlow?","completion":"TF and PyTorch the way they were designed, it doesn’t matter.

Of course, we help! Humans do a terrible job of cleaning the house. We help by chucking stuff onto the floor and whacking it under furniture. This necessitates humans having to get down on their hands-and-knees and see for themselves the dust bunnies gathered under furniture, and dirt on the floor. Being low to the ground, we see every speck of dirt, and assist the humans is also taking a closer look at ground level. If they leave their dirty dishes on the counter — even for a few minutes — a glass of water on the table, we’ll assist them in taking a lick or drink. For some reason, humans find this activity unacceptable, and they’ll get off their lazy butts, and immediately wash the dishes…with soap! They’re okay with us giving them a love lick, but bring out the industry-strength dish-washing detergent when we stick our heads in their half-empty glasses of water. Fine. When they show this level of ingratitude, I use paw to push the glass and water onto the floor. The human then need to get out the mop to clean up the mess. “About time,” I think, noticing a few bits of dirt on the floor. Do I sound angry? Nope. Not me. I also put nose prints on the windows and sliding glass doors because they could use a bit of cleaning too. “Get with it humans. Get out the Windex and start cleaning.” Yes, us cats definitely help with household chores.

Certain celebrities have escaped this punishment by citing reasons such as rushing to a charity function etc. I also remember a couple of RAF pilots getting caught doing well over 100mph driving with no lights on a stretch of unlit motorway. When stopped they explained they were testing out night vision goggles! I've passed police cars doing over 85mph in a 70 zone (virtually all motorway speed limits were still 70mph when I left England) and they've ignored me. But if they think you're driving dangerously, they're bored, or in need of making their quota, they may stop you.

Needless to say, I produced my deed, which they refused to look at. So I banned them from using my driveway, which they claimed was a right of way. Only way to access their back yards. Told their lawn service that they were trespassing and not to use my driveway.

They have a lot of cool things, they’re useful when buying online, and they have some cool things that can make them good when dealing with them from the point of view as a consumer. As an employee, direct or through another company (I currently work for a courier that has a contract with them)…. they are horrible and their organization, from what I have experience with is chaotic at best. It’s like throwing stuff at a wall to see what sticks - only difference is they throw a LOT of stuff, so enough stuff sticks so people can see enough stuff working out to feel it is a success.

That’s the thing people don’t get about NASA—it doesn’t chart its own path. NASA is a government agency, which means it does whatever Congress says and only what Congress says. NASA’s vision of the Space Shuttle was quite different from what Congress mandated it build. Congress wanted something that the military could use for polar-orbit missions, which is why the wings were so big (and then the military never used it for that purpose). Congress demanded that the solid rocket booster contract be awarded to Morton Thiokol, which is why the boosters had joints that failed and destroyed the Challenger. NASA is required to do as Congress says. If Congress says “NASA, you’re going to Mars,” NASA says “sir yes sir we’ll start planning a Mars mission sir.” If Congress says “NASA, forget Mars, you’re going to the moon,” NASA says “sir yes sir we’ll start planning a moon mission sir.” If Congress says “NASA, forget rockets and spaceships, you’re arranging flowers now,” NASA says “sir yes sir roses or daffodils sir.” That’s how Federal agencies work."},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"The simple answer is that thousands of gallons of jet fuel burning in a relatively closed space easily reached temperatures that caused the structural steel beams that were holding up the immense weight of the building above, to fail.

It’s a not-uncommon thing for middle school teachers to deal with. It’s because of a combination of: girls maturing sooner and faster than boys.boys not realizing that what they’re saying or doing is a form of harassment.girls not knowing how to deal with what’s happening and, sometimes, brushing it off as “normal behavior” and something they just have to learn to deal with. Things like boys snapping a girl’s brastrap, commenting on the fact that they have or haven’t “developed” yet, and pulling their tampons out of their bookbags and putting them on the floor where the classmates will see them… these are all forms of harassment. The boys, and sometimes the girls, don’t realize that they are, so I have to stop it, reprimand the boys, and educate them about these things. For some boys, it’s a losing battle, because what I’m telling them and modeling for them is the opposite of the way their fathers or stepfathers treat women. [Anecdotal tangent here.] It’s been my experience that there’s definitely a difference between cultures when it comes to what counts as “harassment.” When I’ve complained to parents about something their son is doing to harass a female student, parents from some cultures don’t think it’s harassment. They think it’s just “boys being boys.” It’s not my place to judge their culture, but it is my place to control what their son does while in my classroom, so I have to reprimand the son and make sure he doesn’t do it again, even if the parents don’t think it’s wrong."},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"Starting to make money online with affiliate marketing involves strategic steps to build a successful venture: Choose a Niche: Select a niche you're passionate about and knowledgeable in.

Moving away from feminism and towards trust. Love is trust in motion. Super simple, remove the ego power of feminism. Replace it with feminine power of the heart. Evolve women in their hearts to realize value in women. All problems of any society not of ancient background are directly the cause of feminism. Give me any issue, any problem and I’ll show you how it is directly the cause of irresponsible masculine women posing as “women's helpers”. Oh, of course, because I’m here to help. I’m a woman’s advocate. The real kind, you know, where “women have the right to be women”, not have to be turned into men to be accepted. Ego is misery. Heart is joy. Which path are you on? Can you move towards joy? If not, there is something blocking you from your heart? What is that? Take a dive, not to deep, just a conscious look inside. What social dis-ease is rocking your ability to dump your misery machine (ego) and center your heart? The disruptors please stand up. Take a look. Who and what do they look like? Why is hatred being generated inside and not joy? You see? You must break it down for yourself. Responsible men (those of a backbone in charge of their ego) help women stay out of their ego and in their heart. If men or posers as masculine women, are keeping you from your heart, dump them along with their irresponsible ego. Super simple. Moving away from posers of power seeking ego trips and towards those who help you stay in your heart are going to be the ones who you can evolve in your own femininity and move in joy. When a woman can respect a man then the woman respecting will be adored by the man. All problems solved with one move. In the opposite direction of distrusting/ego/feminism. Or is it? If this is the answer, why is it so difficult for love then? Love is extremely easy if: Assuming there is a woman of heart. If not, how would you instill a heart in a woman for the man to adore? Assuming there is a man of backbone. If not, how would you instill a backbone in a man for the woman to respect? Thus, there lies the deeper dive into why this equation makes for the hardest thing in life to solve for, love. What is the most beautiful thing in life, but the hardest to realize? Is this why they say, “the hardest thing to do in life is to find love”? If you allow trust in your heart, love will flow. Who’s stopping you? You, if your ego is in charge. Ego/feminism blocks life/love. Only because men and women seek love and not ego. The ego manifested and not controlled is the equivalent of the devil in charge. No one wants that for anyone or their children. Which is why some very responsible cultures work hard at raising their kids with the basics: Boys - to be in charge of his ego by having a backbone. Girls - to be in charge of her emotions by having a heart. The west puts no effort into it. In fact, to reverse the natural process of love. At an earlier age feminist mothers require girls to irresponsibly abandon their hearts by taking contraception. As well as both genders changing their sex. This is a result of feminism washing the genders' into extinction. All to remove men from being in charge and the head of the culture and family. Fact check: No woman can be happy until she has a man in charge of her. For one reason. Ego is misery and heart is joy. The most love possible is father sky to mother earth. The duality in the universe. Without the electromagnetic field of dual polarity, you fall off the planet. Are you generating universal energy as love, or attempting an ego fight to short circuit it? So life is solving for love? If the equation was based on - Love = trust in motion. Then the variables for each sex… Love for a man = Respect for his backbone as it is in charge of his ego, hers and their extensions. So he can adore a woman who opens his heart. To the degree, adores the extensions. Love for a woman = Adoration of her heart as she is in charge of her emotions by her heart. So she can respect a man who will adore her for respecting him. Then, she has only love for the extension’s. Conclusion: Respecting a man with a backbone, who is responsible for his ego and as the head, his family’s (ego, manifested as a tool for survival does not care and as such, cannot be respected but feared only). Will return the adoration for a woman who is responsible for her emotions with a heart…Problem solved. A family of success or a feminist fail.."},{"prompt":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: The most amazing photos I have ever taken were of the beautiful mountain range I stumbled upon during a road trip.

It is vital to address this matter with empathy and understanding, acknowledging that various factors contribute to the high incidence of depression in today's society. Here are a few key reasons why this generation may have a higher incidence of depression: Technology and Social Media: The prevalence of technology, particularly social media, has deeply influenced today's generation. Alongside its advantages, it has brought about challenges. Social media can breed unrealistic comparisons, cyberbullying, and a constant quest for validation, leading to feelings of inadequacy, isolation, and depression. The curated online personas rarely mirror real life, fostering endless self-comparison and negativity. Academic and Professional Pressure: The current generation experiences immense academic and professional pressure. Competitive education systems and the pursuit of high achievement often lead to chronic stress and a sense of not measuring up. The fear of failure, combined with societal expectations, can contribute to depression and anxiety disorders. Financial Stress: Today's generation has experienced economic instability, with recessions, increasing living expenses, and limited job opportunities. The weight of student loans and the need for stable employment can cause significant financial stress, which is strongly associated with mental health problems, such as depression. Stigma and Accessibility to Mental Health Support: The stigma surrounding mental health persists, preventing many from seeking help due to fear of judgement or limited access to resources. Initiatives like [LINKED_TEXT: Talk To Big Ears] [URL: https://talktobigears.com/]’ Listening Sessions, provides a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and receive support without fear of judgement. The high incidence of depression among today's generation is a multifaceted problem. It is essential to tackle it holistically by promoting mental health awareness, providing effective support, and fostering a society that prioritizes well-being. By empathizing with and comprehending the obstacles confronting this generation, we can strive for a healthier and more supportive tomorrow."},{"prompt":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","completion":"Did they ask for advice?

Assuming you’re talking about a complete fixture or lamp, then the answer is more complex. First, dimming. There are, broadly, three ways to dim an LED lamp or fixture. Line voltage. There are a range of technologies including resistance, triac, SCR, IGBT, that control the voltage, switching, or current to the end load. These technologies require no extra wiring to the device. Most dimmable lamps are intended to be dimmed with one of these types of dimmers.Low voltage. Generally 0–10V, this requires four wires to the devices—two for power and two for the low-voltage dimming.Digital. The most prevalent are DALI and DMX. There are also a host of proprietary protocols from various manufacturers. Most wallbox (standard household or commercial) wall dimmers are designed for line-voltage dimming and use either triacs or (less frequently) resistance to dim the load. These are inexpensive and very common dimmers—and so the majority of line-voltage dimmable LED fixtures are compatible with them. Fixture manufacturers will test and many publish lists of compatible dimmers for their fixtures."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","completion":"Angular is based on TypeScript while AngularJS is based on JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of ES6 and it's backward compatible with ES5. AngularJS uses terms of scope and controller. To scope a variable you can add many variables that will be visible in View as well as in Controller.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","completion":"“The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.” A very accurate statement, however, the Federal Government can not force a state to assist in the investigation, apprehension, or detainment of citizens that are in compliance with state firearm laws that conflict with federal firearm laws. The action by Missouri is taking is not a voiding of federal firearms laws, it is a refusal to enforce federal firearms laws that conflict with state firearm laws. The practice of not enforcing federal law was popularized by sanctuary States & Cities that began the practice of not assisting in the investigation, apprehension, or detainment of illegal immigrants."},{"prompt":"Why do iMessages go through as text messages and calls go straight to voicemail?","completion":"As others have pointed out, it could be due to poor network connectivity on the recipient’s end. I’ve definitely been far enough “off the grid” that calls and messages won’t reach me. If that’s the case, I’ll usually get a barrage of messages and missed calls suddenly when I get into an area of better service. The same would be true if their phone died or they turned it off/put it in airplane mode. The other possible answer, though, and what I initially thought when I read your question, is that you’ve been blocked. Both of the things you described, especially if they happen together, would suggest that whoever you’re trying to contact blocked you. If both of those things happen multiple times over multiple hours/days. I’d bet it’s a block. Let’s face it - in today’s world, nobody is out of network connection or has their phone fully off for extended periods of time."},{"prompt":"As a Buddhist, how can I increase my level of compassion without being taken advantage of?","completion":"I like this perspective: “True compassion is not about giving or taking. True compassion is just doing what’s needed.” That is to say, you have no preferences or agenda of your own. You are not being kind to be liked by others, to feel good, or impress. You are not indulging your own feelings by being tangled in a situation. You are not over-identifying yourself with the other person; you are not projecting. You don’t think of reward. This helps you to avoid pressure i.e. manipulation aka being taken advantage of. When you meet the situation (in person or via media), you will decide how to respond. If you want to, and you can, then do it; if you don’t, don’t enact self-feeding drama about it. This kind of honesty brings relief. Kindness needs to be in everyone’s heart. Compassion is doing what’s needed. That’s all. Will you light for warmth, devotion, for show, or for real?

The formula is: sum = (n/2)(first term + last term) where n is the number of terms in the sequence, the first term is the starting value, and the last term is the ending value. For this sequence, n = 10 (there are 10 numbers), the first term is 1, and the last term is 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: sum = (10/2)(1+10) sum = 5(11) sum = 55 Therefore, the sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 55.Thanks, me later"},{"prompt":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","completion":"I’m a good looking man so I can understand Kamala wanting a piece of the action"},{"prompt":"What is the reason for the 4 seasons?","completion":"Five seasons would be to many!"},{"prompt":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","completion":"You don’t say how handy you are.

Exactly the same way Americans say they speak “English” instead of “American English.” The terms British English and American English are mainly used to differentiate their different spelling and punctuation systems. Color, colour, favor, favour, period or comma out, period or comma in…. You also should be wary of saying “all UK people,” or “all X people.” In the UK, a large portion of the population speaks some language other than English a lot of the time, and in some neighborhoods you may hear Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi English.

That said, for someone looking for overall value, Lufthansa and British Airways have a lot to offer. Both airlines have great loyalty programs, with Lufthansa's Miles & More program giving members access to a variety of exclusive deals, while British Airways Executive Club offers members the chance to earn generous rewards. For travelers looking for the best international airfare deals, Lufthansa is an excellent choice, offering some of the lowest fares in the industry. They also have a number of partners, making it easy to combine flights and save money on airfare. Emirates, on the other hand, tends to be a bit pricier, but their service and network of routes is unparalleled.Overall, the answer to which airline is better is subjective and dependent on the individual traveler's needs. However, both Lufthansa and British Airways have excellent offerings when it comes to loyalty programs, international airfare and hotel deals."},{"prompt":"Where could I watch The Flash for free?","completion":"I’m relatively new to Quora, I belive this is an A2A…?

What you are talking about is what physicists call CAUSALITY. Causality is a pain in the ass, for a very simple reason. We can sort of play around with TIME, when it comes to photons. And that is because photons can be superimposed, and because all measurements of time are relative. And that means that even when photons are superimposed, there is a causal relationship. The “information” can only transfer at the speed of light. But the actual “measurement of time” can be as reduced or as extended to make everything FIT inside an “event horizon”. You already know of two types of event horizon, one associated with black holes and one associated with the big bang. But this idea that every event has to FIT INSIDE an event horizon of both BEFORE and AFTER comes from the fact that a fundamental assumption is that causality is always conserved. We can say that we have two EVENT STREAMS. One where the “spacing between events” is one set of time measurements, and one where the “spacing between events” is another set of time measurement. And therefore we can even ASSUME a type of superposition of UNCONNECTED EVENTS inside that event horizon bounded by both BEFORE and AFTER. If they are unconnected, then it does not make a difference what ORDER they are in the event stream. But here is the problem. Where in the physics does it say which events are connected, and which events are not connected? We can imagine (or assume) singularities INSIDE the black hole or BEFORE the big bang. But there is just to much that is “connected” in the part of the unverse that is not “sub-quanta”, bearing in mind that even “quantum events” are not the same as those that we can OBSERVE all the time, and not just at the point of COHERENCE. I have used a lot of “significant words” here, and I make no excuses for this. Photons are “spooky things. We need to be precise about what we mean. But your question just might be a very very good one. Because what you are talking about is CAUSALITY. There will always be a sequence of events that HAVE to take place in a certain order, even with sub-quanta things. Or maybe not. Maybe time is quantised too, and quanta time therefore can also be superimposed. Let us go to an often misunderstood analogy - that of Schrodinger’s cat. When the door is closed, we can say that the cat - standing in for the sub-atomic particle with a state - can have two superimposed states. Alive and dead. But if we play around with time, we can now say that the cat can have only the one “superimposed in time” state, and two different times for it to be “resolved” in so that we can OBSERVE that resolved state. Now this is nonsense, in the sense that there is no need to make things more complicated. We can say that causality is conserved at the point of resolution, and leave it at that.The cat is dead, and whatever happens after that will not change the past. The cat is alive, and whatever happens after that will not change the past. Now that I have got your hopes up that perhaps we can quantise time and play around with causality for photons, we can’t. Photons do not experience time, quantised or otherwise.Photons do not experience state. They have no state. They are like “spooky messengers” that transfer “information” at the speed of light, and do not violate causality in what states are caused by others.And this is true even if the actual measurement of times by an observer will be different, in between different EVENTS unless the events inside that “horizon” are not CONNECTED. But your question is still good. Even though photons do not experience time or state - and therefore causality is not something we have to worry about for them, the electrons the photons interact with do have state. The electrons do experience time. So if we have any causal relationship, then right at the start that causal relationship HAS to be conserved in the entire CONNECTED universe. And that means if we can violate causality, the universe is not connected. We can have superposition in anything we can observe. Not just electrons - we do not really observe the photon, just the change of state of the electron. Meaning that the cat analogy can be real. The cat can be both alive and dead. So something has to give. If electrons can be superimposed, but not cats, then we have to be able to show that only within that “event horizon” where we can have superposition can we violate any causality in the order of the elements in that “block of time”. But the electron only transfers “information” about itself at the speed of causality. To use a very bad analogy, there may be two elements in that “state” of the electron, but when that state is resolved, there is only one that is caused or causing. So it really isn’t photons or electrons that have a problem with causality. The photon really does not get involved, because it is only the messenger of “information” that sets up the causal relationship. And that means there is no “sequence” in that photon that is carried by it. The photon really is not associated with time at all, only the time limitation on “information” being transferred by the speed of light, by it."},{"prompt":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","completion":"That’s where we live Our solar system The distance between Earth and the moon When all the planets are put together, that’s what the distance between Earth and the moon is.

Other things that you can do to improve your English are: Think in English: Even when you are deep in your thoughts, shun your native language and think in English. This would be the stepping stone for you in your efforts of communicating in English. Be your practice partner: Once you begin learning English, eradicate every other language from your day-to-day conversation, first with yourself, and then, with other. Be your practice partner in the initial days. Talk to yourself loudly in English. Stand in front of a mirror and practice speaking in English. You can select a topic and start speaking on it before the mirror. Pay attention to every single word that you speak. This is the best way to improve your English communication skills and develop public speaking skills. Listen to English: Watch English movies and series. Take help from the YouTube channels. Repeat what you hear. This will also improve your communication skills in English. Sing English songs: When you begin to learn English, everything must be in English. Wear your headphones and play some English music. Try to sing along. Read magazines and blogs: Read English magazines and online blogs. They use easy English which will help you to understand the basic words at the initial stages. You must also develop a habit of reading English books of your interest. You must read English content as much as possible. Build your vocabulary: Learn new words. Once you are done with the basics of English language, it is the time for taking a step further. Read novels and find out new words. Underline them, find their meaning and memorize them. There are many vocabulary books that could help you in building a strong vocabulary. Learn sayings and phrases: Learn the phrases and sayings as they create an impact while speaking. Practice speaking them out louder. Practice for specific occasions: If you are learning English for some specific purpose like for an interview, you must keep that as your prime focus from the beginning. Practice the language in a way that could help you to crack the interview. Even while practicing in front of the mirror, imagine that you are giving an interview. You could practice them with a friend or you could use Engvarta app & practice interview role play with an English expert as well ( I would recommend this method because that will help you build confidence when you will speak with a stranger compared to your friend and also the experts can guide you and give you additional tips to make your interview better. ) Regular practicing an interview will not just improve your English speaking skills but will also help you to be comfortable on the day of the interview.

She's not obliged to go through a pregnancy because the man wants to support and be there for the child. If she does agree to go through the pregnancy, she's not necessarily going to be stepping up and taking care of said child.

If they cared about you that much, they wouldn't make you feel like you should be considering it to begin with. But the fact that you are is concerning and I think you should break up with your partner and go to therapy for codependency…because that is what that is. You're wanting to make radical life changes for someone you barely know, that could have negative effects on you psychologically. That is not good. I am not trying to sound mean or judgemental. Codependency is extremely common. But you need to learn to break free from that mentality so you can have a healthy relationship. Plus you'll be happier.

Along with these astras, arjun was also capable to wield Sudarshan Chakra, which no other than krishna can hold. Arjun was a Maharathi, and was close to being a Mahamaharathi. A Maharathi is someone who is capable to defeat 12 Atirathis at a moment. But arjun was capable of subduing 4–5 Maharathis at a time. Then he is capable enough to defeat 48–60 Atirathis at a time and 576–720 Rathis at a moment. So we can easily calculate his ultimate power as a Maharathi. But Arjuna was not a ordinary Maharathi. Most people misunderstood arjun or predict him as overrated, because of his mental breakdown before battle, thus resulted Bhagavad-gītā. But if we try to understand that, how difficult it is for a righteous person to kill his own innocent family members who are bind to support adharmis. Arjun was indeed a Mahanayak, and was capable of ending the war in a day by other restricted weapons, i.e. Brahmastra, Vaishnavastra, Brahmadand. But his biggest strength was his charioteer, lord Krishn. He can, let his friend down. [LINKED_TEXT: Ayush R.

Forge welding consists of heating two pieces of metal to near their melting point and then hammering them together. Properly done, they become one piece. In many cases, the metals will form an oxide layer while (or even before) being heated. To prevent this a flux is usually used. The flux is a substance that melts at a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the base metal, dissolves the oxides and spreads across the base metal keeping it from oxidation. Borax is the most commonly used flux, but pure white silica sand will work. There are many proprietary fluxes on the market. Forge welding can be done without flux, but to do so one needs to keep the metal in a very low oxygen area of the fire The same principle is involved in “cannister welding” where the metals to be welded are in a sealed steel box with an oxygen scavenger. Some metals forge weld easily, and others are almost impossible to weld. High Chromium alloys are very hard to weld because chromium oxide is resistant to all common fluxes. Forge welding is combined with other processes. In making laminated steel (often incorrectly called Damascus) a forge welded billet is folded and welded back to itself. The folding is NOT part of the welding process, but often folows welding a billet."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"Many people think that we are an electrical engineer, so we should be omnipotent, so 1.

If the ball is thrown with enough speed and in the right direction, it could enter into a stable orbit around the Earth, just like a satellite. On the other hand, if the initial velocity of the throw is not high enough to enter a stable orbit, the ball would eventually fall towards the Earth due to the force of gravity. As the ball falls towards the Earth, it would accelerate due to the increasing gravitational force, and eventually, it would reach a very high speed as it approaches the Earth's surface. The ball would experience air resistance as it falls through the Earth's atmosphere, which would slow down its descent and eventually cause it to come to a stop or land on the Earth's surface.

My dear parents-in-law used to go out to dinner in the same restaurant every week and always asked for the same waitress. She took great care of them every time. Finally my in-laws became too frail to go out to restaurants. The next time I had dinner there and sat in that waitress’s section, I gave her a big tip and told her it was my thanks for taking care of my in-laws. I also am organizer of a knitting circle that meets for lunch once a month in our favorite local cafe.

Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"Remember Big Bang theory. I would love to take Leonard Hofstadter and his relationship as an example. Sometimes you get goosebumps when he starts talking and overthinking. This is something that happens to lots of smart people. Smart people have often a hard time focusing on the obvious. While there is one thing to do, they process many thoughts in parallel. Then it can happen that these thoughts intermix. While they say one thing, they think something else. They stutter, they start talking about one thing, and suddenly seem to jump into a completely different topic. I have met many smart people not being able to get to the point while people who were less smart dominated discussions. There is another aspect to it. Smart people often are aware that the truth is manifold. Meaning: If they say A, they know they say A, but at the same time - with more data available A can be wrong, but B or C can be right. And not just that, if you change your viewpoint, you may even discover that A and B might be right. It is just a matter of perspective. If you then talk about Schrögingers Cat, you complete the circle. Now, have a look at someone else. A is right, everything else is wrong. There is no discussion.

But battleships NEVER went out without lighter ships to scout for it. Nothing like an unexpected torpedo in the rudder (which caused the ship not to be able to move except in circles) or somewhere else to REALLY spoil one’s day! It was the largest ship in the German navy and thus it was VERY VERY big news when it was sunk. In the British House of commons Churchill was giving a speech in the House of Commons on a completely different subject when a page came to him with a note (which was HIGHLY unsual since pages DON’T bring notes to ANY MP while they are speaking most especially the prime minister unless the news is deemed to be VERY big). Churchill sat down, read the note and before carrying on with his speech said “Honorable members, I am pleased to report to you that the Bismarck has been sunk!” at which point the House dissolved into cheering and a standing ovation and after that 10 minute ovation Churchill finished his speech.

He would start a game, “key in” the cards that he received or were visible, and wait for the computer to signal (via a silent vibrator) whether he should stay or stand. He said that, in the long term, he was able to win some money, but that it was time-consuming, not a lot of money, and that a casino employee (not the dealer) came by after a while and watched him while he played. In other words, except to show that it could be done, it wasn’t worth the effort."},{"prompt":"What are some real life bad habits that MIT gives people?","completion":"MIT teaches you not to sit down, shut up, and follow orders. It also teaches you that the \\"right answer\\" is a technical answer and social hierarchy does not determine truth. Just because your boss says 2+2=5, doesn't make it so. This can be a good thing. It can also be a bad thing. It can certainly cause some extremely painful situations. There are times in which corporate policy is that 2+2=5 and you should sit down, shut up, and follow orders. One other bad habit, is that I can't stop thinking sometimes. MIT teaches you to be extremely busy, and sometimes you just need to *relax* (and not get annoyed that corporate policy says 2+2=5). I didn't realize how busy MIT makes people until I ended up back on campus, met a few people that never left, and I was thinking to myself \\"chill dude.\\""},{"prompt":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","completion":"A good leader is someone who can effectively guide and motivate their team or organization to achieve a common goal.

A confident person exhibits competence in a natural and effortless way. How to practice self-confidence? So far we have talked about the definition and importance of self-confidence. Thus, it makes sense to discuss how anyone who is struggling with low confidence can develop it in real life. Here are some ways to boost your confidence and start a new life Photoshop your self-image Our self-image has a much deeper effect on us than it has on others. You might not realize but the way you see or think of yourself is what you become in reality. Discard negative thoughts It goes hand-in-hand with the above point but it deserves to be discussed separately. Negative thoughts are one of the reasons that might restrict your growth in life. Get rid of them as early as possible. Dress for success Confident folks like to dress smart, crisp, and to-the-point because they know that the way you dress makes a lot of difference in how confident you feel. Wearing nice clothes can help you leave a long-lasting impression on others. Empower yourself with knowledge One of the essential things that automatically sparks confidence is knowledge and expertise in a niche. It’s easy to sense confidence when you hear someone speaking about something they know. Empowering yourself with knowledge is a sure-shot way to build self-confidence. Remember, it’s a process…. Confidence is a state of mind more than anything else. It’s one of those useful qualities that gives you the ability to try new things, take more risks, and achieve more. It’s a long-term process, not a one time gig. If you combine it with other essential traits like hard work, patience, resilience, and problem-solving skills, you can easily achieve anything in life.S Source : [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-confidence-key-unlock-your-potential-sandeep-kashyap/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3Bf%2FNdJgAnTlyrGBtP%2BjTZuQ%3D%3D] [URL: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-confidence-key-unlock-your-potential-sandeep-kashyap/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3Bf%2FNdJgAnTlyrGBtP%2BjTZuQ%3D%3D]"},{"prompt":"What information should entrepreneurs invoicing new clients for the first time include in the paperwork?","completion":"Include: Amount due.Description of what the invoice is for. Be detailed enough so that the client will know what it’s for, and so that a year from now you can trace what it was for. This is especially important if you end up issuing multiple invoices to a client — at some point you may need to reconcile payments with amounts still outstanding.Due date. Sometimes this is abbreviated to [LINKED_TEXT: common commercial terms] [URL: https://www.mycreditcontrollers.co.uk/Articles/list-of-invoice-payment-terms.html]. You might use something like “Upon Receipt” (i.e., due immediately) or “Net 30” (due within 30 calendar days) or “2/10 Net 30″ (due within 30 calendar days, but if paid within 10 days the client can deduct a 2% discount).Your payee name. Make sure this the same as whatever is on your bank account. This is for several reasons, including so that if the client sends you a paper check you can deposit it into your bank account without hassle. (Some banks are picky about mismatched payee / account names and may reject a deposit, forcing you to go back for a replacement check.)Mailing address for paper checks.Contact info. Include a phone number and/or email address. Questions sometimes do come up, and you want your client to be able to contact you.EIN number. This is your Federal tax ID number issued by the IRS. It may be on your W-9 form, but it’s good idea to include it on your invoice, too, as later on the paperwork may get separated.Your completed IRS W-9 form if you are operating as an individual or an LLC. The payor will need this for tax purposes in the United States, if the amount paid to you is at least 600.Invoice number. While this is not essential, assigning a unique number to every invoice helps reconcile payments later and keeps your accounting straight. So it’s a good practice to do.Thank You message. Don’t forget to include a brief and friendly “Thank you for your business” type of statement. The above are the main things to include with every invoice. However, depending on the particular client or how payment is to be made, you may also include: Credit card payment button. If you accept credit card payments and you send electronic invoices, try to include a button for PayPal or another shopping cart. This way, the recipient can hit a button to pay as soon as they receive the invoice. It increases your likelihood of getting paid faster.ACH info. If you accept electronic ACH payments, include bank account information (bank name, bank account number and bank routing number). This is for direct deposit payments to your bank account, when both parties are within in the United States.Wire transfer info. For international wire transfers coming to the U.S., include a Swift code also.Purchase order number. Some large clients use purchase orders for certain transactions. So if one was issued in your case, you need to put the number on the invoice so they can cross reference their records.Any special Terms documents. Some large clients require their own purchasing/payables terms be adopted as part of the invoice documentation, to supersede any terms you have. Large clients dictate the terms to smaller vendors. In a couple of instances we were required to sign off on and attach the client’s Ts and Cs document to every invoice. Don’t be surprised if they give themselves early payment discounts and longer payment deadlines as part of their purchasing Ts and Cs, too! Finally, a word about VAT. Some European clients will request a VAT number. Most U.S. entrepreneurs or small businesses can simply respond “not applicable”. European companies ask as standard operating procedure. However, smaller businesses in the United States almost never have a VAT number (nor do you want to get one if you can avoid it!). We in the U.S. are not required to pay VAT taxes except in circumstances where we might have a substantial European connection. If you are required to pay VAT, due to your unique circumstances, you probably know this already."},{"prompt":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","completion":"For videos of coaching classes you can join @VideoLecturesIAS"},{"prompt":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","completion":"Hi ! i have given GATE CSE exam so i think i am qualified to answer it.

It is an impossible task to answer this very unspecific and broad question as it has so many layers and it lends itself to provoke a fierce debate that leaves one even more confused than one was before asking. Broadly speaking, music of any kind is primarily processed by our limbic system, or “the reptile brain”, that is the primary center of emotions. It is then assessed by the higher centres of the brain and its effect on an individual is then rationalised, and intellectualised in a better case, and an individual opinion is then formed and argued. The fact that we don’t have billions of different tastes is based on our common evolution of our emotional system. A myriad of individual factors in our lives is then responsible for individual perceptions and tastes. Heavy metal/hard rock is by its impact on the dopaminergic/ adrenerdic systems and that leads to a secondary increase of prolactin, the love hormone”, this creating an immense perception of emotional well-being of the individual. Similar to some drugs and antidepressants. Make your own conclusions from here. From my point of view each one of the two bands successfully repeat this recipe on each of their albums, sometimes ad nauseam, with varying degree of quality of their music. Many other groups do, e.g. Status Quo, Queen etc etc. To me Iron Maiden are better businessmen, thanks to Bruce, Judas Priest are a bit more adventurous, i.e. Nostradamus.

Genome convergence is the process by which two species that share a common ancestor can evolve to become more similar.

I remember I even cried with emotion at Natural Born Killers when stoned… (such a beautiful murderous couple they were)… Alcohol goes very well with nicely cooked food I’m happy to eat pomegranates like apples when stoned, pith and all (quartered obviously)… It’s a messy experience! The ability to actually enjoy eating a pomegranates like an apple when stoned is a gift from the gods… Alcohol, in moderation, boosts my confidence… Weed, in any quantity, makes me more hesitant… But on the plus side, it makes playing videogames much more intense… So, I don’t know… there’s a time and place for both. I’ve been through stages in my life where I’ve combined the two but I’ve found that is not a good combination for me. I just become unresponsive and want to sleep. Overall, by nature, I would say I’m probably more of a weed person (as I’m naturally fairly introverted), but from a health perspective I would rather not smoke any more (and haven’t beyond a couple of drags in seven years), so would say by default alcohol just about wins out. I do miss the whole ritual of rolling though… Coming home from work and rolling that first joint was always a glorious experience!"},{"prompt":"Would you vote me for president?","completion":"Will you pass a balanced budget amendment?"},{"prompt":"Which is the best ethical hacking course?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: CEH ] [URL: https://www.isoeh.com/ceh.html]- Certified Ethical Hacking certificate provided by EC council is the most prestigious certification for Ethical Hacking which is accepted globally.

Doctors have the opportunity to help people and make a difference in their lives. They also enjoy good salaries, job security, and the potential to specialize in an area of their choice."},{"prompt":"Theoretically, isn’t it possible for two species which are distantly related to come to appear closer related by the genome converging and mutating to be more alike?","completion":"This is called convergent evolution. There are “right answers” to “how to survive in ____ environment.” For example, there is a right answer to how to be a coastal ambush predator. That answer is shaped like a crocodile. Anything that does coastal ambush predatoring will end up looking at least a little bit like a crocodile."},{"prompt":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","completion":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain? You would become an average person. Those of us who use LESS than 100% are not considered normal, and in fact might be referred to as developmentally alternatively advantaged, or whatever term is used these days. You can’t say RE-TAR (your driveway). If you DID, you would get in trouble. It saddens me that entire words are being used as a basis to delete answers, even when used correctly, in the manner they were intended."},{"prompt":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","completion":"A friend of mine once remarked that the way to become a folk hero in the Balkans was to kill a lot of Turks.

Is (perhaps surprisingly, given its image) quite socially liberal. You could say “one nation tory” rather than “Conservative party in general, in all aspects” Its opinion on 2017 GE is “a plague on all their houses” and rather despairing… It was strongly pro-Blair."},{"prompt":"Do your cats ‘help’ you with household chores?","completion":"My orange tabby loves to help with dishes.

Fortunately, there are many ways in which experienced physicians can prove this by subjective or objective means. There was a patient brought into the ER “unconscious”. She failed to respond to questions or any verbal commands. Since she could not hear us, we discussed among ourselves at the bedside that we would need to do an emergency brain biopsy right then and there. Since she was “unconscious” she would not need any anaesthesia and would not feel anything. “Nurse! Bring the brain biopsy tray in here to the bedside, this is an emergency” The patient experienced an immediate and miraculous recovery before we could get started. She walked out of the ER without any further treatment. In the ENT world, we are always amazed at the people with “hearing loss” as a result of their work seeking compensation. It is impossible for someone to fake hearing loss successfully with an experienced ENT doc or Audiologist. We can test your hearing even when you are asleep. Don’t even try!"},{"prompt":"it ever too early to start a design history file ready ideation for a medical device? What about when the clinician first talks to the engineer?","completion":"From the technical and regulatory perspectives, you can start as early as you want. However, It’s usually not efficient, in my view. The design history file SOP adds complexity and extra process steps to the early phase of design and prototyping. In my experience, fairly radical changes in design, component shape, materials, and even design approach happen over and over again in these early design phases. If you’ve got a design history file right from that first conversation, you have to deal with all of the “weight” of organizational process in your SOP. You really want to start the design history file, IMHO, when you’ve got clarity that the design is fit for purpose, manufacturable, and meets the commercial considerations. Note that many regulatory people really do feel otherwise, that the best practice is to start the design history file early. Perhaps someone with that background will chime in to defend the idea. You should, however, take notes in a signed lab notebook for purposes of documenting invention and reduction to practice for patent purposes. Even the approaches and designs that you discard are helpful to patent."},{"prompt":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","completion":"If you are looking for professional photo editing software, I recommend [LINKED_TEXT: autoRetouch] [URL: https://www.autoretouch.com/].

A lot of tartar and dental calculus builds up in a mouth that never gets brushed and this leads to periodontal disease and infection. Another cause could be ulcers related to systemic illness or oral masses. Kidney disease can also cause a characteristic odor. Having a vet exam is the best way to rule out these issues.

Around 8000 candidates polled from different political figures. We have also seen the violence in all phases in West Bengal even when there is very less chance of tampering of votes. I.e.votes can be rigged and not captured. EVM with VVPAT is a great option in a country like india. When needed paper trial can also be done in case if needed, as happened this time where 5% VVPAT votes were counted manually, and not even a single mismatch found isn't a great news it took 7–8 hours extra time to announce the results. Countries like UAE, BELGIUM, Egypt nepal, Maldives are using EVM.
