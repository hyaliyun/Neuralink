Dennis liked pop music, but Jason preferred classical music.","completion":"Dennis liked pop music, but Jason preferred classical music because he found that classical music offered a more intricate and layered listening experience. Jason enjoyed the complexities of the compositions, which were deeply rooted in history and brought together the works of brilliant composers like Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who had infused their talents and emotions into their masterpieces. In contrast, Dennis was captivated by the contemporary and catchy allure of pop music. He liked how the melodies were easy to memorize and hum along with, and he enjoyed the upbeat lyrics written by today's famous artists like Taylor Swift, Adele, and Ed Sheeran. For Dennis, the modern sounds of pop music were more relatable to his current lifestyle and the everyday experiences he encountered. While Dennis appreciated the ways that pop music promoted connections between people through shared interests and common themes, Jason found that classical music allowed for a more personal experience. He felt that classical music was a transcendent medium that enabled him to tap into his emotions and convey his deepest thoughts without worrying about adhering to societal norms and trends. One of the main differences between pop and classical music for Jason was the element of timelessness that accompanied classical music. He believed that, unlike pop music, classical works remain relevant and timeless, appreciated by generations and generations of people who find solace, inspiration, and beauty in these intricate creations. This timelessness led him to develop a deeper appreciation for the art and contributed to his preference for classical music. Complete with the harmonies and simultaneous melodies present in classical music, Dennis still enjoyed the vibrant and infectious sound of pop music. He loved how it has evolved over time, from the intriguing tunes of the 80s to the pulsating beats of the contemporary era. He felt that pop music provided a soundtrack to his life and was the perfect companion during a lively Friday night with friends or while driving down a sunny highway. Despite their varying tastes in music, Dennis and Jason both respected each other's preferences. While conversations regarding musical choices often leaned towards healthy debates, they were able to find common ground through their shared love for music as an art form that could evoke different feelings and emotions, and provide an avenue for expression and creativity. This mutual understanding led to a deeper appreciation for the diverse world of music and how it could uniquely affect each listener, making it an invaluable facet of human culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia. - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent. - The Armenian Catholic Church (\\"Hay Katoik Ekeeci\\") is one of the Eastern particular churches \\"sui iuris\\" of the Catholic Church. They accept the leadership of the Bishop of Rome, known as the papal primacy, and therefore are in full communion with the Catholic Church, including both the Latin Church and the 22 other Eastern Catholic Churches.

The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - A prelate is a high-ranking member of the clergy who is an ordinary or who ranks in precedence with ordinaries. The word derives from the Latin \\"prælatus\\", the past participle of \\"præferre\\", which means \\"carry before\\", \\"be set above or over\\" or \\"prefer\\"; hence, a prelate is one set over others. - Sui iuris, commonly also spelled sui juris (or ), is a Latin phrase that literally means \\"of one's own right\\". It is used in both civil law and canon law by the Catholic Church. - The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (Latin: Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium, abbreviated CCEO) is the title of the 1990 codification of the common portions of the Canon Law for the 23 of the 24 \\"sui iuris\\" Churches in the Catholic Church.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \\"cleric\\", \\"clergyman\\", \\"clergywoman\\", \\"clergyperson\\" and \\"churchman\\". - In Christian ecclesiology, full communion is a relationship between church organizations, groups, and individuals that mutually recognize their sharing the essential doctrines of Christianity and \\"are able to recognize in one another the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church in its fullness\\". Thus a profession of faith is required of people wishing to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church, even if they have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid. Being \\"in full communion with the Catholic Church\\" is incompatible with denying what it has definitively proposed as its teaching on faith and morals. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Paul Coussa ( 9 September 1917 -- 7 July 2012 ) was a Syrian born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church .

He was a Syrian-born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church. After being ordained a priest in 1941, he was appointed bishop of the Armenian Catholic Diocese of Baghdad, where he served until his retirement in 2001. Aleppo has a rich history, with one of the oldest and continuously inhabited cities in the world. The city's importance grew as it became a significant trading center in the ancient world. As a side note, the complex geopolitical situation in the region, with various countries and cultures interacting with each other, has led to a diverse heritage. The nations mentioned above, such as Turkey, Lebanon, Armenia, and Israel, all have their unique cultural backgrounds, languages, and religions. This diversity is a testament to the historical importance and ongoing relevance of Western Asia in the broader context of the world. Western Asia, also known as Middle East or Southwest Asia, comprises numerous individual countries, many of which share a complex history marked by both cooperation and conflict. It is characterized by a melting pot of various cultures, traditions, languages, and religions. This diverse makeup is the result of millennia of interactions between the different civilizations inhabiting the area, from ancient Mesopotamia to the more recent historical phenomena, such as the spread of Christianity and Islam. The region's position as the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa has infused it with a rich array of cultural influences, from ancient Greeks and Romans to the powerful empires of Persia, the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the region's history has also been shaped by the emergence of major religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Islam, which were both born in and significantly influenced the various societies throughout Western Asia. Today, Western Asia remains one of the most vibrant and diverse regions globally, a hub of culture, religion, and commerce that continues to have a significant impact on the rest of the world. Although political and social challenges persist, the region's extraordinary history and the contributions of its people make it a fascinating and essential component of the broader tapestry of human civilization. In conclusion, situated at the crossroads of three continents, Western Asia has developed a complex intermingling of various cultures and traditions influenced by the historical movements and civilizations passing through the region. This is evident in Aleppo, Syria, where Paul Coussa was born. The nations in this region continue to play essential roles in global culture, commerce, and politics, with their diverse heritages as both distinctions and connections that bind them as a unique yet interconnected collective."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence and a question in the input.

Primark's Twice as Sweet as Sugar Sweeter sugar. Poorer Primark. That's the opposite of what the market has come to expect from Associated British Foods. This time around it was the British conglomerate's sugar division that shone like a silver teaspoon, not its cut-price fashion chain. It made an operating profit of 6 million pounds (8.6 million) in the six months to February 27, reversing a 3 million pound loss last time. The division was helped in the first half by tighter stocks in the global sugar market and lower costs. At last, prices in the European market are starting to rise. Improvement in the sugar division is badly needed. It has seen its profit dissolve from 35 per cent of ABF's total in 2013, to just 4 per cent in the year to September 2015. It's all down to the end of EU sugar sales quotas in September 2017, which has forced producers to fight for big contracts. AB Foods has comfortably out-performed the FTSE 100 over the past year ABF believes sugar has bottomed. It forecasts significantly higher profit for the division next year. In contrast, operating profit at group superstar Primark went backwards, to 313 million pounds in the six months to February 27, from 322 million last time. That's primarily down to sterling's weakness against the dollar. Primark sources almost all its products from suppliers in China and south Asia. It pays in dollars, so the strength of the greenback makes that more expensive. Still, the drop was less than expected because Primark made the most of lower input costs elsewhere, in cotton, oil and freight rates, to offset the dollar strength. Primark sales from stores open at least a year also fell in the first half, although by less than 1 percent. Still, Bernstein analysts estimate this is its first reduction in same-store sales since they started tracking them in 2004. It would be tempting to think we've reached peak Primark, with sugar starting a comeback. But that would be a mistake. True, the outlook for sugar is better than for some time. But Primark, accounting for 42 percent of sales and almost 60 percent of operating profit in the year to September 2015, remains the driver of ABF's fortunes. Sugar has become a much smaller percentage of Associated British Foods' operating profit The U.K. market is tough, but continental Europe and -- most crucially -- the U.S. are performing well. Primark has been well received in the U.S., ABF says, even though Americans don't like its flannel pajamas and U.S. men prefer black and white boxer shorts to other colors and patterns. As Gadfly has argued, while ABF's management has done a pretty good job in steering its disparate collection of businesses, a split between Primark and the food arm would unlock value. Much of the rationale would be to give Primark a higher rating because of its strong potential in the U.S. It trades at a similar level to Zara-owner Inditex when looking at 2018 earnings, but would warrant a stand-alone premium because of those U.S. hopes. The turnaround in sugar lends weight to the break-up argument. ABF's sugar, grocery and agriculture divisions are on a similar multiple to the broader packaged foods industry. With the prospect of a profit rebound in sugar, there's potential to push that higher. All the more reason for ABF to ditch the conglomerate structure.

Context: April 2-May 2 is the worst 30 day period for me. The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. Question: Who died? Options: A.

Rooney, who has 18 months left to run on his contract, has attracted interest from Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid.

The signing of Juan Mata added to the squad depth and boosted team morale, making United stronger in both domestic and European competitions. Fans rejoiced as Rooney and Mata formed an impressive partnership on the field, leading the team to multiple victories. This story ends with the renewal of Rooney's contract, ensuring his legacy continues with Manchester United. Option 2: Rooney transfers to another club On the final day of negotiations, Wayne Rooney, his agent, and Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward failed to reach a consensus. With Rooney's contract set to expire in 18 months, Manchester United reluctantly decided to cash in on their star player. Rooney's transfer sparked a bidding war among various clubs, with Chelsea and Real Madrid leading the charge. After much consideration, Rooney decided to seek a new challenge and signed with the highest bidding club.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form).

Born on April 4, 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, Heathcliff Andrew Ledger was a talented actor known for his memorable roles in a variety of films. Tragically, he passed away at the young age of 28 on January 22, 2008. He was found unconscious in his Manhattan apartment by his housekeeper, Teresa Solomon. Heath Ledger began his career in Australian television shows and films, and his early appearances included the children's TV series \\"Ship to Shore\\" and the teen drama \\"Sweat.\\" However, it was his role in the 1999 film \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" that caught the attention of the international audience. Ledger's career then took the upward trajectory as he starred in a range of movies, including \\"A Knight's Tale,\\" \\"Monster's Ball,\\" \\"Ned Kelly,\\" and \\"The Brothers Grimm.\\" One of his most notable roles came in the form of his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in the critically acclaimed film \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" Ledger's performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and various other awards and recognitions. It was his ability to deeply embody his characters and bring them to life on screen that made him a respected and admired actor in the industry. In 2007, Ledger was cast as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's superhero film \\"The Dark Knight,\\" another role that showcased his outstanding talent for immersing himself in complex and dark characters. Unfortunately, he did not survive to see the release of the film, as he was found dead on January 22, 2008, in his New York apartment. His housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, discovered him unconscious and unresponsive. The official cause of Heath Ledger's death was determined to be an accidental overdose of prescription medications, which included painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleeping pills. It was announced that the combination of these substances caused the respiratory failure that led to his untimely demise. Following his death, Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his exceptional performance as The Joker in \\"The Dark Knight.\\" This role remains one of the most iconic portrayals of a movie villain, and his untimely passing left the film industry and fans mourning the loss of a truly gifted actor."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. Two people got stuck in a local blizzard. Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him. Which of the two people experienced a lower sensation of warmth? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the factors affected by alcohol consumption In this case, the factors are blood vessel dilation and nerve ending stimulation near the skin surface. Step 2: Understand the consequences of each factor Blood vessel dilation and nerve ending stimulation can create a sensation of warmth near the skin surface. Step 3: Determine the effect of alcohol on body temperature Alcohol can result in a lower core body temperature by promoting heat exchange with the cold environment. Step 4: Identify the condition of each person Tom consumed alcohol and found shelter in the snow, while Dan did not consume alcohol. Step 5: Compare the sensations of warmth between the two people Tom would likely experience a higher sensation of warmth near his skin surface due to alcohol's effect on blood vessels and nerve endings. However, his core body temperature might become lower because of the increased heat exchange with the cold environment. On the other hand, Dan, who did not consume alcohol, would not experience the same sensation of warmth due to nerve ending stimulation but might maintain a higher core body temperature. Answer: Dan experienced a lower sensation of warmth compared to Tom, who drank alcohol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

ObamaCare problems making coverage harder to afford, find When Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey announced recently that it’s 46 million in debt and shutting down, it became the 17th failed ObamaCare co-op since the Affordable Care Act launched three years ago. Those failures – just six of the original 23 co-ops remain – have left hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for coverage. Meanwhile, insurers claiming big losses are leaving some state exchanges -- including Indiana University Health Plans, whose exit is expected to result in 27,000 Indiana residents losing ObamaCare plans in 2017. And companies still operating in the federal and state exchanges are raising premiums for next year. Together, the developments are posing new challenges for Americans seeking affordable coverage, and show the highly touted overhaul of the country’s health care system is in some cases not yielding the savings President Obama once promised. As a candidate on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama once said: “If you’ve got health insurance, we’re going to help that employer save 2,500 per family per year. … Those savings are going to be passed along to the workers.” Nationally, though, premium hikes are expected to average 8 percent next year. Many insurance companies are seeking much more than that, for the exchange plans and those offered to employers. Premera in Washington state is approved to charge 19 percent more next year. Rates across California will go up an average of 13 percent. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas is asking to raise premiums a stunning 60 percent. Long-time critics of ObamaCare say they saw it coming. “That basic promise, that it’s going to make health care more affordable, it’s not making health care more affordable,” said Avik Roy, an author and Republican adviser. “It’s making health care more expensive, especially for the uninsured.” The problem remains a risk pool with too many sick people and not enough who are young and healthy. Also, federal backstop programs, aimed at helping companies that miscalculated how much to charge, are now expired. So insurance companies need higher premiums to cover payouts to doctors and hospitals. The alternative is pulling out of health exchanges, which many companies have been doing. In recent months Aetna, United Health Care and several Blue Cross and Blue Shield subsidiaries have announced they will be leaving many of the exchanges in 2017. “That’s going to be the future,” said Roger Stark of the Washington Policy Center in Washington State. “What we’re seeing here is the beginning of a death spiral as far as exchanges are concerned as more companies pull out.” In Indiana, the company pulling out of the exchange had covered 15 percent of those covered under ObamaCare. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, a Republican, told The Washington Times this is further evidence the health care law is “collapsing before our eyes.” The Obama administration says its signature legislation can boast plenty of successes. Twenty-million additional people are insured, whether through the exchanges, through expanded Medicaid or young adults who are able to stay on their parents’ policies. Also, the growth in health care spending nationally has slowed. As for rising premiums, many Democrats including presidential nominee Hillary Clinton favor offering a government public option that would compete directly with for-profit insurance companies. “If a public option could bring premiums down, primarily by paying doctors and hospitals less and having lower overhead and no profit, that would lower federal government costs,” said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes a public option. Trump has called for scrapping ObamaCare and starting over. He favors more competition by allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines. Dan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"ObamaCare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, was created to help people in the United States get health insurance, but some issues have made it harder for people to find and afford the coverage they need.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Anton for the following movie plot: It is New Year's Day of 2006, more than a year after the events of Night Watch. Anton Gorodetsky, the protagonist of the first film, finds himself in the middle of an approaching conflict between the Light and Dark Others, who are still bound with an uneasy truce. Anton is still a Night Watch operative, now working with his trainee and romantic interest, Svetlana. As his son Yegor has now become a Dark Other, Anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of Yegor's attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the Night Watch unable to sentence Yegor. To redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch's service to kill the unborn Yegor (shown in the beginning of the first film), Anton seeks the legendary Chalk of Fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once Tamerlane's property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes. Meanwhile, Zavulon, the leader of the Dark Others and their Day Watch, is waiting for Yegor's birthday. At the birthday, Yegor would become a Great Other and acquire the power that would allow the Dark Others to break the treaty (which is only supported because the Others fear that the two sides will destroy each other). Zavulon's gratitude to Anton for covering Yegor's violations of the treaty doesn't stop him and the Day Watch from attempting to frame Anton for murder and bring him in front of the Inquisition. They succeed, despite the efforts made by Gesser, the head of the Night Watch, to protect Anton from the Dark Others by putting him in Olga's body. While in her body, Svetlana confesses that she loves Anton to the person she thinks is Olga, which pushes their relationship forward. This happens despite Svetlana's initial anger at Anton for not telling her that he was in Olga's body. Anton obtains the Chalk of Fate from its hiding place in a Central Asian cafe in Moscow and uses it to summon Yegor. They initially get on well, but Yegor is resentful when Anton refuses his request to patch things up with Yegor's mother....

The incident in March prompted global outrage as protesters decried another killing of a black American by police. One of the officers likely to be dismissed obtained the search warrant for Ms Taylor's home in Kentucky. The other fired the shot that killed her, lawyers say. Ms Taylor, 26, died when police raided her home in connection to a drug case. Ms Taylor's boyfriend fired at the officers who he said he believed were attackers breaking into their home. Police say they knocked on the door to announce their presence before breaking down the door with a battering ram. Ms Taylor's boyfriend said police did not make their presence known, and he fired out of self-defence. Three officers returned fire with 32 shots, six of which hit Ms Taylor. Ms Taylor's name became a global rallying cry as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death. Of the police officers present at the raid, one has been sacked so far. Brett Hankison has pleaded not guilty to charges of wanton endangerment for firing three shots into adjoining apartments during the narcotics raid. In September a grand jury ruled that the two other officers should not face charges. In October, after a judge gave permission for jurors to speak about the secret proceedings, a juror said prosecutors had not given homicide or manslaughter charges for them to consider. One officer, Jonathan Mattingly, who shot Ms Taylor's boyfriend in the leg, later said the case had \\"nothing do with race\\". In the latest development, two officers received letters this week from Louisville police department that indicate they will soon be removed from their positions, according to the New York Times. Officer Joshua Jaynes was told that an investigation by the department found he had lied when preparing the paperwork to obtain permission to conduct the search of Ms Taylor's home, reported US media. The letter also said he did not plan the raid appropriately. \\"Because the operations plan was not completed properly, a very dangerous situation was created for all parties involved,\\" it said, according to CBS news. A lawyer representing Mr Jaynes told CBS that the officer had not created the plan himself and that senior colleagues were present when the warrant was signed off. Mr Jaynes will be allowed to defend himself against the claims on Thursday, CBS says. Officer Myles Cosgrove also received the notification. Kentucky's attorney general has said Mr Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. Black Lives Matter activists in the US have demanded that Louisville police take stronger action against the officers in the case and say that police too often escape unpunished after killing members of the public. Racial injustice and inequality in the US was again thrust under the spotlight in 2020 following Ms Taylor's death and the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May. But the issue remains divisive. On Tuesday a statue of Ms Taylor erected in Oakland, California, was found smashed just two weeks after it was installed.

The official cause of her death was ruled as accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. The toxicology report revealed several substances in her system at the time of her death, including: 1. Cocaine: Cocaine use was determined to be a contributing factor to her death. The toxicology report indicated that Houston had used cocaine shortly before her death, and it had caused heart issues leading to her drowning. 2. Benzoylecgonine: This substance is a metabolite of cocaine, suggesting cocaine had been processed by her body. 3. Marijuana: The presence of a marijuana metabolite, THC-COOH, was detected in her system. 4. Xanax (Alprazolam): This prescription drug is a benzodiazepine used for treating anxiety and panic disorders. It was detected in her blood, but in therapeutic rather than toxic levels. 5.

Benadryl (Diphenhydramine): An over-the-counter antihistamine medication used for allergies and cold symptoms, also found in her system at therapeutic levels. It is important to note that although several drugs were detected in Houston's system, the official cause of her death was determined to be accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the Anglican Church? from the following article ? According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.

This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the cyclone increases in size will the measurement of its outermost isobar have increased or decreased? Hint: There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).","completion":"Given that the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost isobar will have increased."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An American study suggests that being surrounded by happy friends and neighbours could have more of an effect on your happiness than money.That is the finding of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego. Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler studied the emotional health of more than 4,700 people.They used information from the Framingham Heart Study.That study began sixty years ago in the American community of Framingham.Massachusetts.It was started to learn more about the risks of heart attack and stroke. For the new study,the researchers examined the emotions of the men and women in the Framingham Heart Study.The information was gathered from 1983 to 2003. The researchers found that friends of happy people had a greater chance of being happy themselves.That means that happiness spreads,or has a contagious effect,among people.And,the smaller the physical distance between friends,the larger the effect they had on each other's happiness. Sadness was also contagious among friends,but not as much as happiness.The researchers say social groups did not influence happiness as much as personal situations. However,people removed by as much as three degrees of separation still had an effect on one's happiness.The expression three degrees of separation means the friends of an individual's friends. In fact,persons with three degrees of separation had a greater effect on an individual's happiness than having five thousand dollars.The researchers say the study is historic because it shows that social effects on health can be spread among people. Another finding is that people who work together or are married do not have as much of an effect on happiness levels as friends.The researchers say this is often true among friends of the same sex.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; Data modeling is an essential aspect of database development, as it provides a clear framework and a robust method for defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of an organization's data. This ensures that data is stored, accessed, and managed efficiently and accurately, enabling organizations to make better data-driven decisions. Several reasons underscore the importance of data modeling in database development: 1. Improved communication and collaboration: Data modeling helps multiple stakeholders - business users, data architects, developers, and database administrators - to communicate and collaborate more effectively, as it establishes a shared vocabulary, reduces ambiguity, and clarifies the data landscape. 2. Enhanced data quality: With a well-defined data model, it's easier to maintain data integrity and enforce database constraints, ensuring that data is accurate and consistent throughout an organization. This reduces the risk of errors and improves overall data quality. 3. Facilitated application development: Data models enable developers to leverage a standard structure and design for building applications and generating code, which results in more efficient development processes, less rework, and lower maintenance costs. 4. Streamlined data integration: Developing comprehensive data models allows organizations to understand the relationships between various data points and integrate disparate data sources more effectively. This enhances data usability, drives consistency across data sets, and enables better decision-making. 5. Improved performance: Well-structured data models optimize database performance by defining indexes, keys, partitioning, and other performance-related aspects. This results in faster query response times, minimized data corruption, and increased system availability. 6. Scalability and flexibility: Data modeling promotes a flexible and scalable database design, allowing organizations to adapt to changing business requirements and incorporate new data sources when needed. 7. Regulatory compliance: With increased scrutiny on handling sensitive data, a robust data model enables organizations to manage access control and comply with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA. 8. Reduced complexity: Data modeling helps break down complex business processes and systems into simpler and more manageable components, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the data landscape and identify potential issues. 9. Better data analytics and insights: Accurate data models enable organizations to extract valuable insights from their data, helping them make more informed business decisions and achieve a competitive advantage. In summary, data modeling plays a crucial role in database development, contributing to enhanced communication, data quality, application development efficiency, data integration, performance, scalability, regulatory compliance, reduced complexity, and better analytics.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear?, using the article: George Frideric Handel was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil..., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear is Handel. George Frideric Handel was a renowned German composer whose early musical training was not well-documented due to his father's, Georg Händel's, lack of interest in music and initial discouragement of his son's talents. Despite this uncertainty, it is evident that George Frideric Handel possessed an immense musical talent from a young age and went on to have a highly successful and influential career in music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: How China's Richest Man is Reinventing Dalian Wanda Group The first thing you should know about China’s richest man, Wang Jianlin, is that he’s not afraid to go big. When his Dalian Wanda Group conglomerate opened its first “theme park city” this May, in the small Chinese city of Nanchang, it stretched across two square kilometers, doubling as China’s largest new tourist trap and ammo for Wang’s outsized ambitions for taking on Disney. “The frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,” Wang told China’s CCTV the week before the Nanchang unveiling, in words that were brash even by the outspoken billionaire’s standards. Disney’s new Shanghai park was set to open the following month, but Wang said his park—along with 15 to 20 more that he plans to build—would keep it unprofitable for the next decade. Of Disney dis , he added, “They shouldn’t have entered China.” Not that Wang himself has any trouble crossing borders. Two months later, in mid-July, Wanda was reported to be in the running for a 49% stake in Paramount Pictures, the Hollywood studio controlled by Viacom viab that dates back more than 100 years. The studio’s total valuation might run as high as 8 billion to 10 billion. If Wang were to win the bidding, it would be Asia’s biggest deal in Hollywood since Sony bought Columbia Pictures in the 1980s. And it would top Wang’s last Hollywood deal, which happened just six months ago. In January Wanda spent 3.5 billion on the movie production house Legendary Entertainment, the producer behind Jurassic World and the Hangover trilogy. Even aside from its Hollywood and theme park aspirations, Wanda has been growing—and growing abroad—so fast that the world outside China has begun to pay attention. In 2015 alone, Wanda bought race organizer World Triathlon Corp.; Infront Sports & Media, which is selling Asian broadcasting rights to the next two soccer World Cups; and a stake in Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid, for a total of 5 billion in overseas spending during the year. Back home, its sprawling web of malls and real estate generated enough cash for Wanda to make the Fortune Global 500 list for the first time this year. Wanda ranks No. 385 on the global list, with 27.4 billion in sales and 2.4 billion in profits in 2015, up 18.8% from 23 billion in 2014. If Wanda were an American company, it would rank just above Macy’s m in sales and not far behind entertainment giant Time Warner twx . Wanda’s route to the list, however, has been anything but ordinary. By Wanda’s own count, it is on its fourth company-wide transformation in less than three decades, having started as a small, state-owned real estate developer in the northeast coastal city of Dalian. Its ongoing rise reflects the growing clout of Wang, who has proven himself to be both an inventive businessman and a favored government friend in an economy where such ties are important. Now, he and Wanda are helping China spread its soft power abroad, through everything from stakes in foreign companies to constructions projects along the Thames in London and in downtown Chicago. Wang, 61, was born to a father who served in Chairman Mao’s revolutionary army. Wang himself joined the People’s Liberation Army at the age of 15. But at 32, after tiring of his own officer track, he left for a government job. Wang eventually joined the Xigang Development Company, a residential developer in Dalian, a port city and trading hub near China’s border with North Korea. Wang revived the failing state-owned builder after getting an army buddy’s help securing a loan. He changed the firm’s name from the lifeless Xigang to Wanda (which means “everything being accomplished”) after soliciting names through a newspaper contest. As China tested its first market reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wanda became one of the country’s first companies to issue shares; it privatized over the following years, with Wang becoming its largest shareholder. Tourists visit the Wanda Group’s newly open “theme park city” in Nanchang.Photograph by STR AFP/Getty Images Wanda expanded beyond Dalian and went national in the early 1990s, completing what became its first transformation. It then branched into commercial properties beginning in 2000, when the company’s shopping malls—called Wanda Plazas—began dotting the country. That was its second transformation; a third came as the company branched into tourist projects in the late 2000s. Wang, meanwhile, became a public figure whose slender-cut Western suits and widow’s peak gave the appearance of a leader straight from an executive MBA program, belying his relatively humble origins. Wanda’s fourth transformation started last year, as the company began spreading its money around the world. Wang plans to flip Wanda’s focus from real estate to a few key domestic services sectors. By 2018, Wanda expects two-thirds of its sales to come from consumer services, up from about 40% last year, with an emphasis on tourism, entertainment and sports. Those three sectors happen to be three main drivers of China’s transition into a consumer-led economy, and the government has declared that expanding them is a priority. The ruling State Council released a goal last October to nearly double the value of sports as a percentage of China’s GDP (currently 0.63%), which would make it a 775 billion sector by 2025. “If you can leverage favorable policies, it’s good,” says Wang Xin, president of Greater China for consultancy Frost and Sullivan, of Wanda’s strategy. “In the long haul it’s not about leveraging policies alone, it’s about understanding future trends.” Wang doesn’t hide the fact that Wanda chases government-sponsored trends. “Wanda’s transformation is consistent with China’s economic strategy,” he said in a 2015 speech in China. The State Council released guidelines several years ago encouraging private companies to expand globally: “It can be said that Wanda answered that call,” Wang told Harvard Business School students last October. Wanda Group did not make Wang available for an interview. But Liu Mingsheng, a spokesman, said of the company’s strategy, “The entire Chinese economy is going through transitions. The main objective is to achieve a state of economic growth that is based on domestic consumption. Wanda’s transition is consistent with China’s economic strategy.” Wang’s rise accelerated in 2007, around the time that investors related to top government officials began taking stakes in his private firm. Until then, Wanda had only one other outside shareholder. Wanda was little known, and Wang not yet a billionaire. By last year he had passed Alibaba’s Jack Ma as China’s richest man, worth 34 billion, according to the Hurun Rich List, an annual ranking of China’s wealthiest individuals.

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)VCG VCG via Getty Images According to a 2015 investigation by Michael Forsythe in the New York Times, stakes in Wanda were offered to business partners and relatives of two then-members of the ruling Politburo, and later to the sister of China’s now president, Xi Jinping. In one example, an investor’s stakes multiplied from the 500,000 and 200,000 they paid to more than 900 million. There is nothing illegal about the deals, and Wang has emphasized Wanda does not pay bribes. Wang also appears to have come through Xi’s anti-corruption drive unscathed. Wang responded to the Times report in the speech at Harvard last October, saying Xi’s sister and her husband, Deng Jiagui, sold their shares in the Dalian Commercial Properties unit before it went public in 2014. “Deng sold all the shares held by his investment company and fully exited at a low price point,” Wang said. Still, the financial interactions underscore Wanda’s closeness to Chinese leaders and state institutions and leave the impression of Wang as a favored son. When Wanda bought the U.S. theater chain AMC in 2012, beginning a string of overseas acquisitions, a group of state banks including the government’s State Export-Import Bank helped finance the 2.6 billion deal, offering aid that private-sector companies seldom get. “China still has a long way to go to build its own soft power,” wrote state-run nationalist tabloid Global Times earlier this year. “Companies like Wanda are pioneers on the road of China’s modernization and they deserve more encouragement.” Wanda’s latest transition into consumer services brings it even closer to the government. As part of its move, Wanda wants to reduce the need to invest huge piles of its own money in real estate development. Although it plans to expand the number Wanda Plazas—it will open 55 this year, it says, for a total of around 180—more than 20 of those will be funded by outside investors who hold the land, usually governments or government-affiliated companies. Wanda will share the rental income, but will save its capital for projects like the Nanchang theme park, overseas acquisitions, and a movie studio Wanda is building in coastal Qingdao to rival those in Hollywood. Earlier this year, Wang laid out Wanda’s goals for the next five years. By the end of 2020, he says, the company will reach 100 billion in sales and 10 billion in profits, and overseas sales will bring in 30% of the total. The company treats the figures almost as military orders. Managers head to daily management meetings and see numbers changing from green to yellow to red on their computers, depending on their progress toward these goals. These are audacious figures, not least because Wanda’s sales are expected to fall this year amid a real estate slowdown that has forced many department stores in its malls to close. Wanda says overall sales will fall by 12% in 2016. Unless it goes on a hyperbolic growth streak starting in 2017, expanding sales more than 25% a year, the 100 billion goal looks out of reach. People wear 3-D glasses while watching a movie in a Wanda Plaza cinema in Tongzhou, China.Tomohiro Ohsumi — Bloomberg via Getty Images But 100 billion by 2020 is probably not Wanda’s ultimate goal, anymore than keeping Shanghai Disneyland unprofitable for a decade is a real strategic objective. Instead, Wang wants Wanda to become an international brand, with the same name recognition as Microsoft, Apple, and Walmart. “That’s my dream,” he said at Harvard. That aligns very closely with the Chinese government’s goal: a strong Chinese private-sector presence on the world’s corporate stage, where the country now is represented only by a handful of state-owned banks and energy giants, and a couple of tech companies. Wang is a natural spokesman for a newly assertive China: he’s savvy, sanguine, and brash. At Harvard, he opined on how long it might take for Wanda to become a real international brand. “Speaking of when I could achieve it, maybe in 4 or 5 years the fastest,” he said. “Or 7 to 8 years in a slower pace.” If Wang does reach that goal, it will be both Wanda and China sharing the international stage.

Near the city of Middleton, there are two forests. The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees. Which forest would require a higher temperature to burn?","completion":"To determine which forest—Trine or Jimpy—would require a higher temperature to burn, we must consider multiple factors such as tree density, species of trees, moisture content, and distribution of fuel. All of these elements play a crucial role in the likelihood of a forest catching fire and the intensity of the subsequent blaze. Trine forest, being tightly packed with trees, would have a higher tree density than Jimpy forest. This means there is an abundance of fuel, as trees are the primary source of it. Additionally, in a forest with more trees, the canopy layer becomes denser, trapping heat and potentially increasing the risk of the fire spreading rapidly in the crowns of the trees. Furthermore, with little open space between trees, there may be more accumulation of dead plant material such as leaves, branches, and logs, which provide even more fuel for a fire. However, the species of trees in both Trine and Jimpy forests are also important in determining their susceptibility to fires. Different species carry different flammability and resistance to fire. For instance, trees with resinous bark, like pine and spruce trees, are more likely to catch fire than trees with thicker bark, like oak and maple trees. Therefore, the forest with a higher concentration of more flammable tree species would be more susceptible to burning. Moisture content is another crucial factor to consider when assessing the likelihood of a forest fire. Apart from the forest's vegetation, conditions like soil moisture and air humidity influence the likelihood and rate of fire spreading. In areas with higher tree density and less open space, such as Trine forest, there might be higher humidity due to less sunlight reaching the ground and evaporating moisture. This scenario could make it harder to ignite fires and make them spread and grow. However, a prolonged dry period could still leave the forest vulnerable to fires. Considering fuel distribution, Trine forest's tightly packed trees and fewer open spaces might create a continuous fuel landscape that could enable fires to spread more easily, while the more open Jimpy forest might have breaks in fuel sources that could hinder the fire's spread. Given the factors discussed, it is difficult to definitively determine which forest would require a higher temperature to burn without further information about the types of trees, the moisture content, and related forest conditions. However, based on the tree density and fuel availability alone, Trine forest might have a higher propensity to burn, especially if the tree species are highly flammable. Thus, it may require a lower temperature to ignite and sustain fire compared to the more open Jimpy forest. However, it is important to remember that unique combinations of factors like tree species, moisture, and fuel distribution must be considered to accurately evaluate these forests' potential to burn."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"The phrases \\"MS\\" and \\"PG\\" typically refer to Master of Science and Postgraduate Diploma, respectively. Both are educational qualifications in Canada, but they have different scopes, durations, and outcomes. Before comparing the two, it is important to note that the questions you put forth are quite similar, as both are asking for a comparison between MS and PG in Canada, and therefore, the answer to the question on their similarity would be (b) yes. However, determining which option is better will depend on your personal preferences, field of study, and career goals. 1. Program Duration: The most apparent difference between MS and PG is the program duration. Typically, MS programs require a longer study period to complete than PG. A full-time MS program in Canada generally lasts around two years, whereas a full-time PG diploma program spans for about one year (could extend to two years, depending on the program and college). This distinction could play a significant role in your decision-making, as a shorter program may align better with your time constraints and financial capabilities. 2. Course Curriculum: MS programs in Canada are usually more research-based and theoretical, involving in-depth studies in a particular area. This program equips students with the skills and knowledge to pursue further research or academic careers. On the other hand, PG diploma programs are more industry-oriented, with a focus on practical skills and knowledge that can be directly applied in the workplace. The diploma programs are tailored to equip students for specific professional domains. 3. Eligibility and Admission: MS programs in Canadian universities might be more competitive when it comes to admissions, as they often require a higher academic performance from applicants. The eligibility criteria for PG programs may be less demanding, offering greater opportunities for individuals seeking to gain skills and knowledge in their field but with fewer academic qualifications. 4. Cost: MS programs are usually more expensive than PG diploma programs because of their longer duration. However, opportunities for funding, scholarships, and research assistantships can help offset the cost of pursuing an MS in Canada. Overall, the cost of education will depend on the university and program chosen. It's essential to consider the financial implications and potential return on investment when selecting a pathway. 5. Career Prospects: MS might offer broader career prospects, as it is considered a higher level of education than a PG diploma. MS graduates can enter academia, research-based positions, or professional roles that require specialized skills and knowledge. On the other hand, PG diploma graduates may be suitable for roles that require practical, hands-on skills. The job market for each qualification varies depending on the field and local demands. 6. Potential for Further Education: MS graduates can generally pursue a Ph.D., as their research skills and background in advanced academics have prepared them for doctoral studies. PG diploma holders might not hold the same advantage due to their more applied and vocational focus. In conclusion, the better option between MS and PG diploma in Canada depends on your personal preferences, financial capabilities, time constraints, and long-term career goals. If you are looking for in-depth research, an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D., and a higher level of education, an MS might suit your objectives. Conversely, if you desire practical skills, industry-oriented knowledge, and a faster route to potential employment, a PG diploma might be the better choice for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts? ? Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns.

Answer this question: crimes that do not require mens rea are known as??","completion":"Crimes that do not require mens rea are known as strict liability offenses. The term mens rea, which is derived from Latin, means \\"guilty mind\\" and is a fundamental principle in criminal law. It refers to the mental element or intent to commit a crime, demonstrating that the accused was aware of the consequences of their actions and intended to perform the criminal act. Most criminal offenses require both mens rea and actus reus (the physical act of committing the crime) to establish guilt. Strict liability offenses, on the other hand, do not require the prosecution to prove that the accused had any criminal intent. In these cases, it is only necessary to prove that the accused committed the act in question, without demonstrating any intent or knowledge of committing an unlawful act. The rationale behind strict liability offenses is that in specific instances, protecting society and enforcing certain regulations is more critical than punishing those with a guilty mind. Strict liability crimes are typically established by statutory laws and may vary depending on the jurisdiction. The primary objective behind strict liability offenses is to promote compliance with the law, ensure public safety, or regulate conduct in areas where negligence can result in serious harm. Common examples of strict liability offenses include: 1. Traffic violations: Speeding, parking violations, and running red lights are considered strict liability offenses, where the precise intent behind the action is irrelevant, and the mere act of committing the offense is enough to establish guilt. 2. Statutory rape: In many jurisdictions, statutory rape is a strict liability offense where engaging in sexual acts with a minor is considered a criminal act, regardless of whether the accused knew that the other person was underage. 3. Product safety: Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers may be held strictly liable for selling defective or dangerous products, irrespective of whether they were aware of the defects. The goal is to encourage businesses to ensure product safety. 4. Environmental and public health regulations: Companies that violate pollution control and environmental protection regulations may be held strictly liable, regardless of whether they intended to harm the environment or knew about their actions violating the law. Although strict liability offenses help ensure compliance with essential regulations, they can be controversial as they may result in punishment without the presence of a guilty intent. Critics argue that without the requirement of mens rea, strict liability offenses may undermine the principle of justice that only those who have a \\"guilty mind\\" should be held criminally accountable. Regardless, strict liability offenses remain an essential part of criminal law in many jurisdictions and continue to be used as a tool to deter harmful or negligent behavior and maintain public safety and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who ordered warmer water? Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

Tweet:is trying to find people on twitter but is finding it really hard for some reason!","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet appears to be a mix of frustration and confusion with a slight hint of curiosity. The author is expressing their difficulty in finding people on Twitter and, as a result, is facing a certain level of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the overall experience on the platform. The sentiment is not strongly negative, as the author's tone does not suggest anger or extreme resentment, but more so an annoyance and a desire to understand the reason behind their struggle to find people on the social media network. The curiosity element comes into play with the phrase \\"for some reason,\\" indicating that the author is not only pointing out their difficulty but is also attempting to identify the cause. The fact that they are actively trying to find people on Twitter suggests that they are engaged and invested in exploring the platform, which imparts a sense of motivation and involvement. In summary, the sentiment of the tweet seems to be a blend between frustration, confusion, and curiosity. It is mainly driven by the user's need to understand their challenges in finding people on Twitter, and the potential willingness to take steps to rectify the issue and improve their experience on the platform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which camera would have higher beam quality? Hint: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. A:","completion":"In the context of the information provided, we can determine that Camera A with the small pinhole would have a higher beam quality than Camera B with the larger aperture. The paragraph explains that the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength. It is also mentioned that if the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved, although at the cost of reduced power. On the other hand, if the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much. We can infer from this information that Camera A, with a very small pinhole, is likely to have better beam quality due to the smaller aperture. The drawback of this design choice is that it may result in reduced power. However, it should be noted that if David intends to use a focusing lens with a low f-number and can ensure that the lens will not add significant aberrations to the beam, the smaller pinhole in Camera A would be an optimal choice for higher beam quality. Nevertheless, it's imperative that David considers the trade-offs between beam quality and power when selecting the camera that best suits his requirements for the photography class."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He started to date Minnie Crozier ( Katrina Devine ) but clashed with both Fergus Kearney ( Paul Ellis ) and Mackenzie Choat ( Ingrid Park ) .","completion":"While these two sentences appear to convey a similar situation, there are subtle differences between them. Let's break down each sentence to analyze their meanings: 1. \\"He started to date Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis), but competed with Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) and Mackenzie Choat (Ingrid Park).\\" In this sentence, the individual starts dating Fergus Kearney. However, he also competes with Minnie Crozier and Mackenzie Choat. This competition could refer to their personal relationships with Fergus, or it could be a separate challenge or situation altogether. The main focus of this sentence centers around the individual dating Fergus, while Minnie and Mackenzie serve as secondary characters with whom he competes in some unspecified context. 2. \\"He started to date Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) but clashed with both Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis) and Mackenzie Choat (Ingrid Park).\\" In this sentence, the individual starts dating Minnie Crozier. At the same time, he experiences conflicts with both Fergus Kearney and Mackenzie Choat. The term \\"clashed\\" implies a disagreement or conflict. Though the sentence does not explicitly specify whether these clashes relate to Minnie Crozier, it's reasonable to assume that the conflicts mentioned involve the relationship or personal matters between them. To summarize, both sentences involve the main character entering a new relationship. However, the first sentence states that he dates Fergus Kearney and competes with Minnie Crozier and Mackenzie Choat, whereas the second sentence says he dates Minnie Crozier and clashes with Fergus Kearney and Mackenzie Choat. Although both sentences imply the possibility of romantic competition or conflict, the specifics are different. The first one suggests a more direct competition with the other characters, while the second refers to conflict that could be caused by disagreements, differing opinions, or unrelated issues."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This will give the arrangement a sense of stability. It will also first draw the viewer’s eyes to the center of the arrangement. In a peony arrangement, place a larger red flower in the center. Surround it with pink and white blossoms either in full bloom or in a budding stage. Add some support to the bouquet so that it doesn’t lean to one side. Use tree branches or twigs adjusted to the size of the arrangement to hold up more delicate flowers. Make sure smaller or flowers or buds are interspersed throughout the larger ones to prevent a sense of lopsidedness. For example, intersperse pink tulips, white peonies, irises, and pink delphiniums so that each color is evenly distributed throughout the arrangement. Vary the blossoms in height and color evenly throughout the arrangement. Tuck smaller flowers or buds around the edges. Keep taller plants toward the center and top. For example, arrange aster, blue veronica, blue lisianthus, and larkspur as the base colors. Add accents to the color scheme with red dahlias and “Black Prince” snapdragons inserted between the lighter hues. Do this constantly as you place the flowers inside it. Rotation will ensure you don't neglect any one area and give an even hand to the entire bouquet.

Question: This article: Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face. Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia (also played by Steele). She tells them that she lives with her father, Prince Vajda (Garrani), and brother Constantine (Enrico Oliveiri) in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Gorobec is instantly smitten by the beautiful young woman. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. The witch Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and Kruvajan watches in horror as her coffin... Answer:","completion":"Asa's plan to \\"drain Katia off\\" refers to Asa's intention to drain the life and vitality from Katia in order to maintain and strengthen her own resurrected existence. This process is a common trope in films with supernatural themes, especially those involving witches, vampires, and other undead creatures. In \\"La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday,\\" draining Katia would allow Asa to continue her quest for vengeance against her brother's descendants while at the same time gaining more power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Field goal percentage in basketball is the ratio of field goals made to field goals attempted . Its abbreviation is FG % . Although three - point field goal percentage is often calculated separately , three - point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage . Instead of using scales of 0 to 100 % , the scale . 000 to 1.000 is commonly used . A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency . In basketball , a FG % of . 500 ( 50 % ) or above is considered a good percentage , although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions . Guards usually have lower FG % than forwards and centers . Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player , but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots . In the NBA , Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG % ( around . 580 ) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks .

Damien Gayle. PUBLISHED:. 06:11 EST, 20 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:36 EST, 20 March 2013. Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space. Personnel aboard the ISS often spend months at a time in space, so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential. Captain Williams, who holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman at 195 days, revealed details of the 'orbital outhouse' in a video tour of the station. Stinky: Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams demonstrates the orbiter's smallest room in space in a Nasa video. Her tour of the £12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space. The toilet, she explains, unsurprisingly 'serves for two functions' - number one and number two - with different colour-coded receptacles to accept each. Pointing out the number two loo, she says: 'You see it's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim, and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction.' Pinching her nose, she adds: 'And it smells a little bit, so I'm closing it up.' This is for number ones... Captain Williams holds up the colour-coded tube where astronauts urinate. And this is for number two: Both units have suction 'to keep things going in the right direction', she revealed. 'Also there's a selection of paper,' she says, including a soft kind for U.S. astronauts and a coarser, rough variety preferred by Russian cosmonauts. Captain Williams, a U.S. Navy test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space, says the crew are provided with gloves, nappies and disinfectant wipes, 'in case things really get out of control'. 'The number one stuff can get really all over the place if you don't aim correctly,' she warns. Although, she adds, both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things 'going in the right direction'. For that fresh feeling: Captain Williams points out the baby wipes made available for astronauts. A little privacy please... Captain Williams slides shut the folding door that preserves astronauts' modesty. Of course, that's assuming that all the high-tech components aboard the ISS keep working as designed. In 2009 there was a crisis aboard the station when its main toilet broke down with a record 13 people aboard. One of the pumps in the crew's main bathroom flooded, which is connected to the station's wastewater-recycling system. Astronauts were forced to don goggles, gloves and masks for some impromptu plumbing. They ripped apart the compartment, working well into the evening but failed to solve the problem until spare parts were sent from Earth.","completion":"1. Former International Space Station (ISS) commander Suni Williams provides insight into how astronauts use the toilet in space. 2. The ISS toilet serves two functions, with color-coded receptacles for urine and feces. 3. Accurate aim is important when using the toilet, as waste can easily float around in zero gravity. 4.

If you just bought a new shirt put it on.","completion":"How to meet a girl at a party Prep yourself. First things first: wear your favorite clothes. If you just bought a new shirt, put it on. As the night goes on and the party starts buzzing, confidence will be key to successfully meeting a girl. After all, feeling good in your outfit can boost your self-esteem and make you more approachable. Remember to groom yourself well and wear a light, pleasant fragrance - you don't want to overwhelm anyone with a strong scent. Maintaining good posture and making eye contact are also important aspects of body language that will make you appear more approachable and engaged. A smile will be your best accessory; it's inviting and shows that you're genuinely enjoying yourself. Once you feel ready, take a moment to scope out the room, and observe the party's vibe. Try to find a group or individual that has caught your eye, preferably someone who shares common interests. This will make striking up a conversation more natural and comfortable. When you approach the girl you want to meet, remember to ease into the conversation — don't charge in and start firing off questions. Start with small talk or a light comment about the party, the music, or a mutual friend, and then proceed to ask open-ended questions. This will engage her in conversation and make her feel more at ease. Pay attention to her responses, and listen actively, showing genuine interest in getting to know her better. While chatting, be aware of the girl's body language and overall reception to your advances. If she appears uninterested or closed off, don't push too hard or force her to engage. This might make her uncomfortable or create an undesirable impression. Instead, accept the outcome and excuse yourself gracefully, while leaving the door open for potential future interactions. As the night progresses and you've successfully connected with the girl, continue building on that rapport. Show your sense of humor, but also be curious and attentive to her thoughts and stories. At some point in the conversation, gauge whether or not it is appropriate to ask for her phone number or social media contact details, ensuring that you've laid the groundwork for future conversations and meetings. In conclusion, meeting a girl at a party is a delicate process that requires confidence, patience, and active engagement in conversation. Presenting yourself well, wearing your favorite clothes, and being conscious of your body language are the first steps towards a successful interaction that can potentially lead to a deeper connection. So, the next time you find yourself at a party, remember these tips, and create long-lasting connections while having a fantastic time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Dwarf gouramis have a fecundity of about 600 eggs.(1) Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest.The male will protect the eggs and fry. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch, and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free swimming and leave the nest. When the fry are two to three days old the male should also be removed or he may consume the young. Question: can male and female dwarf gouramis live together? Choices: --no --yes","completion":"Yes, male and female dwarf gouramis can live together. They build a nest and the male courts the female.

FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public.

We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797 22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - Stirtonia is an extinct genus of New World monkey from the middle and late Miocene . Its remains have been found in South America . It is classified in Alouattini with howler monkeys . - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as birds, small mammals and fish. Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The crocodilian lies motionless beneath the water's surface with only their nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the water's edge. The crocodilian then lunges out of the water, taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed.

The ex-spy chief said trust between governments and internet companies had been shattered and needed rebuilding. Another UK terrorist attack \\"would get through\\" at some point, he said. Speaking at the launch of a study by public affairs firm Edelman on attitudes towards bodies like the security services, the ex-chief of the Secret Intelligence Service said it was not possible to stop terrorist attacks like those in Paris without a data-sharing agreement to allow the security agencies to monitor people's activity online. \\"Of course there is a dilemma here because the general public and politicians and the technology companies, to some extent, they want us to be able to monitor the activities of terrorists and other evil doers but they do not want their own activities to be open to any such monitoring,\\" he said. \\"If you allow areas which are completely impenetrable, then, okay, you might feel comfortable that your communications are private and no one else can see them, but so are those who are trying to do you down and undermine your society.\\" Sir John said a breakdown in trust between between internet companies and the government was the result of revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former US spy agency contractor who disclosed the extent of surveillance and electronic monitoring by US and British government agencies. \\"Snowden threw a massive rock in the pool and the ripples haven't stopped yet,\\" he said. Sir John also warned a \\"hardened core\\" of fighters returning to Britain from Iraq and Syria posed a real threat. \\"At some point these threats will get through and there will be another terrorist attack in this country,\\" he said. Sir John Sawers has spent most of the last five years hidden from the public. As the recently retired Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, more commonly known as MI6, he oversaw what he called 'a root and branch' programme of modernisation, moulding the spy agency to face 21st Century threats. He has also had to deal with allegations that, in the years immediately following the 9/11 attacks, MI6 officers were complicit in the rendition and abuse of suspected terrorists. He said these allegations needed to be taken seriously, and they are still under police investigation. Referring to MI6's partner agency, the CIA, he said they had run into problems because they became involved in \\"lethal operations\\". British intelligence agencies, he said, acted in support of the military but did not get involved in \\"kinetic operations\\" involving the use of lethal force. The former spy chief has now left government service and is poised to begin a new career in the private sector. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised laws giving greater access to online communication if he wins the May general election. Some opponents, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have objected to the so-called 'snoopers' charter', saying it goes too far. But Sir John, who was formerly known in Whitehall as \\"C\\", backed the prime minister's stance. He said online communication services like Facebook's WhatsApp and Apple's FaceTime could not be beyond the reach of monitoring agencies. \\"I think one benefit of the last 18 months' debate is that people now understand that is simply not possible and there has to be some form of ability to cover communications that are made through modern technology,\\" he said. Sir John was Britain's ambassador to the United Nations before being named as the head of MI6 in 2009. He stepped down from the role in November. He also spent three years as Tony Blair's foreign policy adviser. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The former Chief of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Sir John Sawers, spoke publicly for the first time since stepping down from his position, saying that governments need access to online \\"no-go areas\\" to prevent terrorist attacks and monitor people's activity online. Trust between governments and internet companies, which Sawers believes has been shattered, needs to be rebuilt. He acknowledged the desire for privacy but stressed that impenetrable areas in the digital sphere could also harbor individuals seeking to cause harm and undermine society. Sawers partially attributed the breakdown in trust between internet companies and governments to Edward Snowden's whistleblowing. Furthermore, he warned about the threat posed by fighters returning to the UK from Iraq and Syria, acknowledging that a terrorist attack was likely to occur in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What were five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time? Answer the above question based on the context below: Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\".

New classes or groups in society: As the city became a center for industrialization, various social classes and occupational groups formed, including factory workers, merchants, and artisans. 4. New religious sects: The growth and change in Manchester led to the emergence of new religious groups and sects, influenced by the diverse population in the city. 5.

The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby's reinvention of a similar, previous character, the android Human Torch of the same name and powers was created in 1939 by writer-artist Carl Burgos for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, Timely Comics. Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Storm gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays. Growing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional Long Island suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon Franklin Storm, escaped unharmed. Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, Sue Storm. At 16, Storm joined his sister and her fiance, Reed Richards, in a space flight in which cosmic radiation transformed those three and spacecraft pilot Ben Grimm into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated superhero team the Fantastic Four. Storm, with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project fire, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the World War II-era hero of that name. In The Fantastic Four #4, it is Storm who discovers an amnesiac hobo whom he helps regain his memory as the antihero Namor the Sub-Mariner, one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics' 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, returning him to modern continuity. Though a member of a world-famous team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School. Here he thought he maintained a secret identity, although his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become the recurring Fantastic Four foes the Wizard and Paste-Pot Pete, later known as the Trapster. In Storm's home life, Mike Snow, a member of the high-school wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Storm dated fellow student Dorrie Evans, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship. Did he have any siblings?","completion":"Yes, Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Storm, also known as the Human Torch, did have a sibling. He had an older sister named Sue Storm. Sue is a significant character in the Marvel Comics universe and is known for being a part of the Fantastic Four, the same superhero team that Johnny is part of. Sue, like her younger brother Johnny, was exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation during a space flight with Reed Richards, who would later become her husband and the leader of the Fantastic Four known as Mr. Fantastic. This exposure to cosmic radiation gave her and the other team members their unique superpower abilities. In Sue's case, she gained the power to create force fields and render herself invisible, leading to her superhero alias, the Invisible Woman. The Storm siblings shared a strong bond, not only due to their family ties but also because of their mutual experiences as part of the Fantastic Four. Overall, the relationship between Sue and Johnny Storm is complex and multi-faceted. They often found themselves dealing with their shared loss and family history, all while navigating their heroic duties. Throughout their many adventures, they proved to be not only powerful superheroes but also caring and protective siblings. Johnny's impulsive nature often contrasted with Sue's more reasoned approach, leading to a dynamic and evolving sibling relationship. Despite the challenges they encountered, both as ordinary individuals and as superheroes, Johnny and Sue Storm embodied resilience and perseverance, helping each other to face numerous battles and personal trials. As one half of the Fantastic Four, they represent two key pieces of this iconic superhero ensemble, further enriching the narrative landscape of the Marvel Comics universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to narrating the show, Ringo also portrayed the character of Mr. Conductor in the American spin-off series \\"Shining Time Station.\\" However, after Ringo Starr's departure from \\"Thomas & Friends,\\" Michael Angelis, a British actor and voice artist, took over as the narrator for the third series, which began airing in 1991. Angelis continued to provide the narration and voice the characters of the series in the UK for 21 years, making him the longest-serving narrator in the show's history. He stepped down from his role in 2012, and was succeeded by Mark Moraghan, who took over the narrating duties from the seventeenth series onwards. Aside from the narration, \\"Thomas & Friends\\" has experienced a number of changes and evolutions over its long-running history. Since its inception, the show has transitioned from using model trains and stop-motion animation to computer-generated animation. The series has evolved over the years, expanding its cast of characters and the world of Sodor, making it a favorite among generations of young viewers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To summarize the entire process: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food, primarily in the form of nectar from flowers. 2. While gathering food, bees also collect small amounts of pollen which helps in the process of cross-pollination, essential for the reproduction of plants. 3. Bees convert the nectar they have gathered into honey by storing it in honeycombs and evaporating the excess water content. 4. Bees produce wax from special glands in their abdomen, which they use to build the bee hive with hexagonal cells structured together, known as the honeycomb. 5. Bees then make food called honey, created from the nectar they have gathered from flowers combined with enzymes from their saliva. They store the honey in the honeycomb cells. 6. The final step involves using a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis to maintain the integrity of the hive. Bees collect plant resins and mix it with their enzymes to produce propolis. They use it to seal cracks, strengthen the hive structure, and protect it from external threats such as bacteria and fungi. Overall, the process highlights the essential tasks bees perform in sustaining the hive, producing honey, and maintaining the health and structure of the hive through the use of propolis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Quarantining infected people and their family members, closing schools, and imposing workplace distancing and homeworking can all limit the spread, the study found, but a combination of all three is most effective in reducing cases. The global number of confirmed cases passed 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of 0200 GMT on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, with more than 16,500 reported deaths. Singapore, which according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data had reported 455 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two deaths as of March 22, has imposed some social distancing recommendations but has not closed its schools. Elsewhere, millions of children have seen their schools closed in the United States, across much of Europe and in many other countries as governments have imposed strict social lockdown measures to stop people meeting and mingling in groups. Published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the study, conducted by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS), looked at a simulated Singapore setting to analyze the potential impact of social distancing policies. It found that while less effective than the combined three-pronged approach, quarantine plus workplace measures presented the next best option for reducing COVID-19 cases, followed by quarantine plus school closure, and then quarantine only. “The results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of enhanced outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner,” said Alex R Cook, an associate professor at NUS who co-led the work.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose water bottle was destroyed? During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur. He rolled and rolled until he hit into Bluebird's tree heavily. No matter how much he tried, foolish Coyote could not shake the dust from his fur. And so the fur of all coyotes had the dull colour of dust to this very day. Question: Where did Coyote go after his fur turned blue? Options: A: To the lake. B: To the tree. C: To the cave.

The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties. Hint: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Fire sweeps clothing factory in Bangladesh -- more than 100 killed Bangladeshi firefighters battle a fire at a garment factory in the Savar neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh, late Saturday. By NBC News wire services Updated at 3:25 p.m. ET: DHAKA, Bangladesh -- At least 112 people were killed in a fire that raced through a multi-story garment factory just outside of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, an official said Sunday. The blaze broke out late Saturday at the eight-story factory operated by Tazreen Fashions Ltd., a subsidiary of the Tuba Group, which supplies Walmart and other major retailers in the U.S. and Europe. By Sunday morning, firefighters had recovered 100 bodies, fire department Operations Director Maj. Mohammad Mahbub told The Associated Press. He said another 12 people who had suffered injuries after jumping from the building to escape the fire later died at hospitals. The death toll could rise as the search for victims was continuing, he said. Local media reported that up to 124 people were killed in the fire. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, and authorities have ordered an investigation. Army soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed to help police keep the situation under control as thousands of onlookers and anxious relatives of the factory workers gathered at the scene, Mahbub said. He would not say how many people were still missing. Working conditions at Bangladeshi factories are notoriously poor, with little enforcement of safety laws, and overcrowding and locked fire doors are common. The cause of this fire was not immediately known. Tazreen was given a \\"high risk\\" safety rating after May 16, 2011, audit conducted by an ethical sourcing assessor for Wal-Mart, according to a document posted on the Tuba Group's website. It did not specify the conditions or violations that led to the rating. A spokesman for Wal-Mart said online documents indicating that the factory received an orange or \\"high risk\\" assessment after the May 2011 inspection and a yellow or \\"medium risk\\" report after an inspection in August 2011 appeared to pertain to the factory where the fire occurred. The August 2011 letter said Wal-Mart would conduct another inspection within one year. Spokesman Kevin Gardner said it was not clear if that inspection had been conducted, or if the factory was still making products for Wal-Mart. If a factory is rated \\"orange\\" three times in a two-year period, Wal-Mart won't place any orders for one year. The May 2011 report was the first orange rating for the factory. There was no indication whether the violations had been fixed since the May inspection. Neither Tazreen's owner nor Tuba Group officials could be reached for comment. The Tuba Group is a major Bangladeshi garment exporter whose clients include Walmart, Carrefour and IKEA, according to its website. Its factories export garments to the U.S., Germany, France, Italy and The Netherlands, among other countries. The Tazreen factory, opened in 2009 and employing about 1,700 people, makes polo shirts, fleece jackets and T-shirts. Bangladesh has some 4,000 garment factories, many without proper safety measures. The country annually earns about 20 billion from exports of garment products, mainly to the United States and Europe. In its 2012 Global Responsibility report, Walmart said that \\"fire safety continues to be a key focus for brands and retailers sourcing from Bangladesh.\\" Walmart said it ceased working with 49 factories in Bangladesh in 2011 due to fire safety issues, and was working with its supplier factories to phase out production from buildings deemed high risk. At the factory scene, relatives of the workers were frantically looking for their loved ones. Sabina Yasmine said she saw the body of her daughter-in-law, who died in the fire, but had no trace of her son, who also worked at the factory. \\"Oh, Allah, where's my soul? Where's my son?\\" wailed Yasmine, who works at another factory in the area. \\"I want the factory owner to be hanged. For him, many have died, many have gone.\\" Mahbub said firefighters recovered 69 bodies from the second floor of the factory alone. He said most of the victims had been trapped inside the factory, located just outside of Dhaka, with no emergency exits leading outside the building. Many workers who had taken shelter on the roof of the factory were rescued, but firefighters were unable to save those who were trapped inside, Mahbub said. He said the fire broke out on the ground floor, which was used as a warehouse, and spread quickly to the upper floors. \\"The factory had three staircases, and all of them were down through the ground floor,\\" Mahbub said. \\"So the workers could not come out when the fire engulfed the building.\\" \\"Had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the factory, the casualties would have been much lower,\\" he said. Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. The recovered bodies were kept in rows on the premise of a nearby school. Meanwhile, many of the bodies were handed over to families but at least 60 bodies remained unidentified till late Sunday, said police official Moshiuddoula, who uses one name. The unclaimed bodies were later taken to Dhaka Medical College where the corpses will be kept until Monday morning for identification. Otherwise, the bodies will be handed over to a charity organization, Anjuman-e-Mufidul Islam, for burial, said local chief government administrator Sheikh Yusuf Harun. The charity group is a voluntary organization which buries unclaimed bodies. By late Sunday, firefighters had concluded their search and left the scene, the fire department's control room duty officer Bhajan Sarker told The Associated Press by phone. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed shock at the loss of so many lives in the blaze and asked authorities to conduct thorough search-and-rescue operations. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said it would stand by the victims' families. Separately, a flyover under construction fell onto a busy market, leaving at least 14 people dead including three construction workers in southeastern city of Chittagong, an official said Sunday. Local fire official Abdul Mannan said the concrete structure collapsed on Saturday night, and authorities recovered the bodies by Sunday morning from under the debris in the second-largest city after Dhaka.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Kreider, Lundqvist end Rangers' skid with 3-2 win over Jets WINNIPEG — Oh, to be King for a day — again. Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves Tuesday night for his first win since returning from a seven-week injury absence, topping the Winnipeg Jets, 3-2, to snap a two-game team losing streak and push the Rangers back on top of the Eastern Conference. “I felt so much better than the last game,” Lundqvist said, citing Saturday’s 4-2 loss in Boston, his first start since being cleared to play. “Just my focus and being more comfortable, it’s night and day.” RELATED: RANGERS' MARTIN ST. LOUIS INTENDS TO PLAY THURSDAY IN MINNESOTA The Rangers (48-21-7, 103 points) struggled through several tough stretches but worked hard and got goals from Mats Zuccarello (goal, assist), Derick Brassard (goal, assist) on the power play and Chris Kreider on a blazing third-period rush to snap a 2-2 tie for the win at 16:14. “Usually I stay wide there,” Kreider said of darting into the middle to receive new linemate J.T. Miller’s feed at the blue line. “For whatever reason, I thought it would be a better option to dart across, and (Miller) made a great pass. My job was easy.” Defenseman Dan Girardi was credited with 10 blocked shots, a Ranger record since the NHL began tracking the statistic in 2005-06. Captain Ryan McDonagh (assist) laughed out loud when told of Girardi’s total. “He’s the master of blocking shots,” McDonagh said. Lundqvist won for the first time since making 33 saves in a 6-3 home win over the Florida Panthers on Feb. 2, before he was sidelined with a partially torn blood vessel in his neck. He truly looked like himself when Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien hammered one of the NHL’s hardest slap shots off the goalie’s helmet 11:23 into the third period, and he didn’t flinch. “I’m happy the mask worked,” Lundqvist said with a smile of the charity helmet crafted with the help of his fairly competitive friend, tennis legend John McEnroe. RELATED: CROSS-CHECK TO J.T. MILLER INFURIATES ALAIN VIGNEAULT Lundqvist was extremely patient, waiting for Jets shooters to make every first move. It made him look more stationary than usual but it was an effective, conscious strategy. “I corrected a couple things,” Lundqvist said. “Less movement is something we talked about after the first game, just to try to do a little less, not challenge too much. I felt like my timing was a lot better.” McDonagh said the win was important not only for Lundqvist but for the team, which had lost three of its last four coming in. Like Saturday in Boston, the Rangers again put Lundqvist in a hole early, surrendering the first nine shots to Winnipeg. They fell behind 1-0 and 2-1 on goals by Jets forwards Jim Slater in the first period and ex-Ranger Lee Stempniak in the second. But they rallied to hand the Jets (39-26-12, 90 points) a big loss as Winnipeg fights for a playoff spot in the West, while furthering their own hopes to lock up postseason home ice. They have six regular-season games remaining, beginning with Thursday night’s conclusion to this two-game road trip in Minnesota. “This last several games we weren’t really giving ourselves a chance,” McDonagh said. “But tonight with our battles, compete level, we were working hard all over the ice. “It might not have been pretty at times. We were pinned in our zone at times, but we did a great job of sticking with our structure and found a way to put the puck in the net.” Summary:","completion":"In their recent match, the New York Rangers managed to secure a 3-2 win against the Winnipeg Jets. The Rangers broke their two-game losing streak, with Henrik Lundqvist making 32 saves for his first win since a seven-week injury absence. Mats Zuccarello, Derick Brassard, and Chris Kreider each scored goals to help the Rangers get back on track. This win was essential for Lundqvist and the team as they push for the Eastern Conference lead and playoff positioning with six regular-season games remaining."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 04:29 EST, 5 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:34 EST, 5 June 2013. Tax havens which allow the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the UK taxman have been summoned to London to explain themselves. David Cameron has warned Britain's overseas territories and crown dependencies that he is determined to tackle the ‘scourge of tax evasion’ which costs Britain billions. Senior ministers from 10 territories including Jersey, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have been invited to a meeting this month where they will be urged to sign up to greater tax transparency. Scourge: David Cameron, pictured walking to Parliament today, has summoned ministers from British territories to a tax summit this month. Mr Cameron has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland on June 17 and 18. He has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘get our own houses in order’ and will attend the Open for Growth conference on the weekend before the G8 summit opens. Senior ministers from Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are expected to attend. Some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens, though they dispute this description and regard their low-tax regimes as vital to their economies. There is said to be disagreement in Whitehall about how much pressure to put on the islands, fearing excessive demands from London could lead to them refusing to co-operate. Mr Cameron is examining the idea of getting the tax havens to sign up to an OECD convention on the sharing of information on tax between countries, which is seen as a key to tackling evasion. Last month he wrote to the British overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance’ a priority for the G8 summit. Haven: A total of 10 overseas territories and crown dependencies, including Gibraltar, have been told to 'get their own houses in order' Summit: Ministers from the Cayman Islands (left) and Bermuda have been urged by Mr Cameron to ensure tax transparency ahead of the talks in London this month. He added: ‘I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership. ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all. ‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. ‘There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.'' A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We strongly welcome the overseas territories' positive engagement with our G8 presidency agenda on tax transparency and the significant progress they have made in this area. ‘We look forward to welcoming them to our G8 Open for Growth event in the run-up to the G8 leaders' summit and will continue to work with them and others to agree commitments to advance trade, ensure tax compliance and promote greater transparency.’ Last month Mr Cameron hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax. The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.

He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (Kil'ayim). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the father?","completion":"It is challenging to pinpoint an exact source or reasoning that dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the father. However, here is a possible explanation based on historical and cultural factors: In many ancient societies, the patriarchal system was the prevalent norm. Men often held primary power and authority, particularly when it came to lineage and succession. As a result, children would usually be recognized through the father's line, and their legal and social status would follow that of their father. In patrilineal societies, the father would be responsible for the financial support, protection, and social status of his children, so it would have made sense that children would be connected to their father's family lineage. However, this system may not have been applicable in cases where a legal marriage could not be contracted. In those instances, children would likely follow their mother's lineage, ensuring their affiliation and connection to a family group for social and legal reasons. Besides the general trend of patriarchal systems in ancient societies, it is essential to note that there might have been specific cultural, social, or legal factors that dictated lineage rules in various communities. These factors could have influenced individual societies to follow different lineage rules or make exceptions in particular cases. In the example of the Tannaim potentially being influenced by Roman law, the matrilineal transmission of offspring might have been adopted due to its compatibility with Roman legal principles, which were dominant at that time. In conclusion, there doesn't seem to be a specific source that dictated that offspring would follow the father when a parent could not contract a legal marriage. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider historical and cultural factors, including the patriarchal system in ancient societies, which could have played a role in the development of these lineage rules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization.

It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681. Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves .

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This is a natural substance that contains silica and other trace elements, and when taken correctly, it can kill mature parasites, larvae, and eggs. Additionally, it can also help improve your overall digestive health. Only use food-safe diatomaceous earth. Other varieties can be harmful if ingested. Typically, you'll need to start by dissolving 1 tsp (5 ml) of the powdered supplement into 8 oz (250 ml) of water. Drink this solution once daily. If necessary, you could gradually increase the amount to 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) if the infection persists for several weeks. The B-vitamins in apple cider vinegar can help nourish the body as it fights against infection, and its acidic pH can help neutralize the pH of the body while improving digestive health. Start by taking 1 tsp (5 ml) of apple cider vinegar up to three times daily. Taking it 30 minutes before each meal can improve your body's ability to absorb it. If you handle the initial dosage well, you might be able to gradually increase it to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) instead of 1 tsp (5 ml). Certain herbs and spices are believed to help strengthen the body and combat invading parasites. You can take most in the form of capsules, powders, and teas. Herbs commonly used against parasites include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise, wormwood, curled mint, and black walnuts. Similarly, cinnamon is one spice that may have anti-parasitic properties. Season your dishes with cinnamon or drink a solution made with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of cinnamon and 8 oz (250 ml) of water up to three times daily. Note that some herbs may have toxic side effects when taken for prolonged periods, and others can negatively interfere with other medications. Thoroughly research any herb before taking it medicinally. In particular, both coconut oil and olive oil may help your body get rid of intestinal parasites. Cook your meals with either oil instead of using butter, margarine, or other cooking oils. To aid your body as it fights the infection, consider taking either oil supplementally, as well. Dissolve up to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of coconut oil into hot tea. Toss 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of olive oil with any vegetables you consume or drink it straight. Dissolve 1/2 cup (125 ml) of Epsom salts in a full bathtub of hot water. Soak in the water for 15 to 20 minutes. While the salt bath may not kill the actual parasites, it can help remove the toxins left behind by those parasites, which helps your body's ability to fight the infestation. The salt water draws these toxins out of your body through the pores of your skin. Neem tree oil is an old anti-parasitic folk remedy originating in India, and you can take it as a capsule or tea. It kills parasites and flushes out the toxins left by dying parasites, and it may also help restore the health of your liver after infection. Follow the dosage instructions that come with the supplement. Precise dosage will vary depending on the severity of your infection, your age, and your overall health. It's best to talk to a healthcare provider before taking this supplement to avoid the risk of complication. Note that neem is not safe for women who are pregnant or nursing since it could severely hurt or kill the baby. It can also be toxic to young children. As you eliminate parasites from your intestines, you may experience severe bodily discomfort and abdominal pain. Going through the treatment at a fast pace will increase this discomfort. If you're receiving treatment under the guidance of your physician, follow the schedule set by your doctor to ensure the maximum benefit. When you're primarily relying on home treatment, you should try to stretch it out over the course of several weeks. Maintain an anti-parasitic diet for a few weeks before introducing some of the supplemental treatments (apple cider vinegar, diatomaceous earth, neem oil, etc.) into your system.","completion":"This article talks about using natural substances and methods, like special earth, apple cider vinegar, herbs, oils, and baths, to help get rid of parasites and make your tummy feel better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But a statement filed in court by the FBI gave the first detailed account of how the shootings unfolded. According to the FBI, Ciancia entered the airport’s Terminal 3 about 9:20 a.m. and approached the security checkpoint. Pulling a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber M&P-15 assault rifle from his bag, he fired multiple times at point-blank range at Hernandez, who was on duty and in uniform, leaving the screener wounded. Then, after starting up an escalator, Ciancia looked back at Hernandez, who appeared to move. Ciancia then went back to shoot him again. the statement said.Hernandez was fatally wounded. Ciancia then shot at “at least” two more TSA employees and one airline passenger, wounding all three, before two pursuing Los Angeles Airport Police officers wounded him, the FBI said. In a bag that Ciancia had at the airport, the FBI said, other law enforcement officers found a handwritten letter, signed by the suspect, saying that he had “made the conscious decision to try to kill” TSA employees. Ciancia’s possessions at the scene “included five magazine clips” of ammunition. Ciancia was taken to a hospital; an FBI spokesman said no information about his condition was being released Saturday night. The gunfire sent panic through the nation’s third-busiest airport and disrupted air traffic there along with the travel plans of thousands of would-be passengers throughout the nation. The airport was fully reopened on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. On Saturday, Hernandez’s wife spoke to reporters outside her Los Angeles area home, describing him as a “wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend.” She said her husband, who was about to turn 40, had come to the United States at age 15 from El Salvador and “took pride in his duty for the American public.” Still unclear Saturday was what had led Ciancia to make the TSA his alleged target, but there were signs of psychological trouble. According to an account from police in the New Jersey town where he grew up, Ciancia had sent a text message to his brother indicating that he might harm himself. The message had aroused enough concern to prompt his father on Friday to get authorities to check on him in Los Angeles, where he was living. “I understand that they tried to reach him,” said a neighbor of Ciancia’s father in New Jersey, “but they missed him.” The incident also raised questions about airport security and the possible mixture of mental illness and weapons, as well as about Ciancia’s state of mind.","completion":"The FBI has charged a suspect, Ciancia, with murder following a shooting incident at Los Angeles Airport (LAX), however, his motives towards the Transport Security Administration (TSA) remain unclear.

Thinking Hernandez was still alive, Ciancia went back to shoot him again. He then shot at two more TSA employees and one passenger, before being wounded by two pursuing airport police officers. In a subsequent search, the law enforcement officers discovered a handwritten letter in Ciancia's bag purporting his decision to take the lives of TSA employees and found that he had additional ammunition clips with him. With no current update given on Ciancia's medical condition, the incident has caused widespread panic, affecting air traffic and travel plans extensively. The airport was fully reopened the following afternoon. Hernandez, who had immigrated to the United States from El Salvador at age 15, was beloved by his family and was about to turn 40. Ciancia's motivation for the shooting remains a mystery, but there are indications of psychological instability. Prior to the incident, he had sent a troubling text message to his brother, suggesting self-harm which prompted his father to request a welfare check by the authorities in Los Angeles, where Ciancia was residing. This tragic incident has reignited debates over airport security, availability of weapons, and considerations about mental health. Detailed probes into Ciancia's psychological status and access to firearms are anticipated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation. Who would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with their boat? Hint: Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar.","completion":"Stephanie would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with her boat due to the cavitation."},{"prompt":"Instructions: This task is about translating a given French language sentence to English.

MyNoise is another great source of relaxing music that can help you center yourself and find some inner peace. Going for a walk or run is another good way to calm yourself down. Getting exercise not only tires us out and lets us release tension, it also releases endorphins, which are the brain chemical that regulates our emotions. Go for a quick jog around the block if you find you're having a hard time. Whether you're playing fetch with a dog or pirates with a five-year-old, having fun with someone who really knows how to embrace the joys of life can make a huge difference when you're having a tough time. Drama, either drama you cause or drama you find yourself in the middle of, can really get in the way of finding your inner peace. We tend to seek out drama because it makes life more exciting, but in order to find peace we have to make our lives more exciting by pursuing challenges instead. This is because the negative feelings associated with drama cannot create inner peace, which relies on positive feelings. If someone in your life is prone to just bringing the drama, try to cut them out as much as you can. There are lots of great, basic comfort activities that you can do to calm down and find peace when you're starting to get a bit on edge.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Jack London had endured more hardships by the age of twenty-one than most people experience in a lifetime. His struggles developed in him sympathy for the working class and a lasting dislike of hard work and provided inspiration for his career as a writer. London grew up in San Francisco in extreme poverty. At an early age, he left school and supported himself through a succession of un skilled jobs ----working as a paper boy, in bowling alleys, on ice wagons, and in canneries and mills. Despite working long hours at these jobs, London was able to read constantly, borrowing travel and adventure books from the library. The books London read inspired him to travel, and his job experiences led him to become active in fighting for the fights of workers. He sailed to Japan on a journey aiming at catching seals and joined a cross-country protest march with a group of unemployed workers. After being arrested for vagrancy near Buffalo, New York, London decided to educate himself and reshape his life. He quickly completed high school and entered the University of California. After only one term, however, the appeal of fortune and adventure proved uncontrollable. London gave up his studies and traveled to the Alaskan Yukon in 1897 in search of gold. Jack London was among the first of these miners. He may have searched for more than gold, however. London once commented, \\" True, the new region was mostly poor; but its several hundred thousand square miles of coldness at least gave breathing space to those who else would have choked at home.\\" Although he was unsuccessful as a miner, London's experiences in Alaska taught him about the human desire for wealth and power and about humankind's inability to control the forces of nature. While in Alaska, London also absorbed memories and stories that would make him known one hundred years later. Once back in California, London became determined to earn a living as a writer.

(CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods is set to return to the PGA Tour Thursday after a three-month hiatus, but this time without his longtime caddie Steve Williams. Woods' participation in the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio -- an event he has won a record seven times -- comes after months of recuperation following knee and Achilles injuries. Speaking to reporters after a practice round Tuesday, Woods said he was feeling the fittest he had in \\"years\\" and was experiencing no ill effects after surgery on his left leg. \\"It feels solid, it feels stable, no pain. That's one of the reasons why I took as long as I did to come back is that I want to get to this point where I can go ahead and start playing golf again like this,\\" he said.

Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \\"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie?, what is it ?

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who had an ancient model of humanism?\\" is in \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\".

Article: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill may play totally inept undercover cops in 21 Jump Street, but at the box office, they’re proving much more effective. The R-rated comedy scored a tremendous 35 million in its opening weekend, enough to easily top the chart. 21 Jump Street opened in the same range as films like Bad Teacher (31.6 million), Superbad (33.1 million), Wedding Crashers (33.9 million), and Scary Movie (42.3 million), but each of those films opened in the summer, when R-rated fare like The Hangover and Bridesmaids has traditionally captured raunch-loving audiences. For 21 Jump Street to earn 35 million over a weekend in mid-March is a far more impressive achievement. Indeed, only one R-rated comedy has ever debuted to higher numbers outside the summer season: Jackass 3-D, which started with 50.4 million in October 2010. 21 Jump Street also opened higher than fellow TV adaptations Starsky and Hutch (28.1 million), The Dukes of Hazzard (30.7 million), and Miami Vice (25.7 million). The strong debut marks a return-to-form for star Jonah Hill, whose live-action comedic catalog seemed less impressive after unremarkable box office performances from The Sitter (30.4 million total) and Get Him to the Greek (61 million), and a slew of more dramatic roles in Cyrus, Moneyball, and Funny People. 21 Jump Street finally delivered on the expectations set up by Hill’s breakout role in Superbad, which earned 121.5 million total in 2007. Channing Tatum, meanwhile, scored his second straight hit after The Vow, which has a running total of 121.1 million. These numbers bode well for his next two releases, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Magic Mike, both out in June. Sony and MGM, who have a potential juggernaut franchise on their hands, spent a sensible 42 million on 21 Jump Street, which earned a “B” CinemaScore grade from polled audiences. In second place, Universal’s smash animated hit The Lorax dipped 41 percent in its third weekend to 22.8 million. After 17 days, the 3D film has found an impressive 158.4 million, already more than the last Dr Seuss adaptation, Horton Hears a Who, which grossed 154.5 million total in 2008. Also impressive is the film’s per theater average, which remains a robust 6,049, even in its third weekend 3-D ticket prices are certainly helping). Considering The Lorax, which cost 70 million to produce, is headed for a final domestic gross right around 200 million, it’s no surprise that Universal and Illumination Entertainment are now getting to work on an animated version of The Cat in the Hat. Disney’s expensive misfire John Carter dropped by 55 percent in its sophomore frame to third place and 13.5 million. The 250 million project has now earned 53.2 million after ten days, and if it continues to play like a frontloaded fanboy flick (and it will), it will finish its run around 80 million. International receipts will need to be utterly gargantuan to save the Edgar Rice Borroughs adaptation — it’s taken in 126.1 million overseas so far. Project X and A Thousand Words came in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Project X fell 64 percent to 4 million, giving the party flick a total of 48.1 million against a 15 million budget. Eddie Murphy’s A Thousand Words dropped by a slim 39 percent to 3.8 million, for a two-weekend total of 12.1 million. The 40 million comedy will join the ranks of Imagine That (16.1 million) and Meet Dave (11.8 million) as major Eddie Murphy bombs. Over on the limited release front, Will Ferrell comedy Casa De Mi Padre proved to be the most caliente smaller title, drawing in 2.2 million from just 382 locations, enough for a sturdy per theater average of 5,759. Friends With Kids, meanwhile dipped by 26 percent to 1.5 million despite expanding from 369 to 641 theaters. Jason Segel/Ed Helms collaboration Jeff, Who Lives at Home proved less appealing, earning 840,000 from 254 theaters, though that was way better than Nicholas Cage thriller Seeking Justice, which found 260,000 from 231 theaters. Perhaps a direct-to-DVD run would have been a better option. 1. 21 Jump Street – 35.0 million 2. The Lorax – 22.8 mil 3. John Carter – 13.5 mil 4. Project X – 4.0 mil 5. A Thousand Words – 3.8 mil Next weekend, a little movie called The Hunger Games is coming out, and with some of the best tracking numbers ever seen a week before release, the hugely anticipated adaptation will likely score one of the best opening weekend’s of the year — maybe ever.

The film, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two cops who go back to high school on an undercover mission, collected a healthy 35 million, according to distributor Sony Pictures. \\"21 Jump Street\\" was the only film to hit theaters nationwide this weekend, though two new comedies debuted in about 60 of the country's top markets. \\"Casa de Mi Padre,\\" a Spanish-language spaghetti-western spoof featuring Will Ferrell, raked in a solid 2.2 million. Playing in 100 fewer theaters, \\"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\\" starring Jason Segel as an idealistic thirtysomething still living in his mother's basement, grossed a so-so 840,000. PHOTOS: Box office top ten \\"21 Jump Street\\" appealed to both genders in nearly equal measure, and all ages went to see it as well: Half of the crowd was under the age of 25, and half was over. However, it played far better with the younger audience, who assigned it an average grade of A, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Those age 50 and over gave the movie a C-, so the movie ended up with a B overall. Co-financed by Sony and MGM for about 42 million, \\"21 Jump Street\\" has earned strong critical reviews and was well-receieved upon its premiere at the South by SouthWest festival in Austin, Texas earlier this week. Loosely based on the '80s television series starring a young Johnny Depp, the film marked a return to comedy for Hill, who this year earned an Oscar nomination for his supporting role in the baseball drama \\"Moneyball.\\" It's also the second box office success of the year for Tatum, the heartthrob who propelled the romantic tear-jerker \\"The Vow\\" to over 100 million worth of ticket sales in February. Meanwhile, Ferrell developed \\"Casa de Mi Padre\\" through his Gary Sanchez Productions. In the low-budget flick, financed by Nala Films for 6 million, the actor plays a Mexican rancher's son who becomes involved in a drug war. The film debuted in 382 locations this weekend, for a per-theater average of 5,759. The movie is being released by Pantelion Films, Lionsgate's co-venture with Mexican media company Televisa. Since its inception in 2010, Pantelion has struggled to find success at the box office. \\"Casa de Mi Padre\\" will likely prove to be its biggest suggest, which to date is last year's 3-million grossing \\"From Prada to Nada.\\" \\"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\\" co-starring Ed Helms and Susan Sarandon, played in 254 theaters this weekend and ended up with a per-location total of 3,300. The low-budget movie was co-funded by Paramount's specialty label Vantage and independent production-financing company Indian Paintbrush. The film has the potential to become the biggest hit yet for filmmaking brother team Mark and Jay Duplass. After beginning their career with a series of \\"mumblecore\\" films -- ultra-inexpensive, documentary-style movies centered around naturalistic dialogue -- the brothers made their first studio project in 2010 with Fox Searchlight. That film, \\"Cyrus,\\" starring Hill and John C. Reilly, only grossed 7.5 million at the box office by the end of its run. [Updated, 12:38 p.m. March 18: It was another bad weekend for \\"John Carter.\\" After debuting with a lackluster 30.2 million last weekend, the 250-million-plus fantasy epic saw its ticket sales fall 55% to 13.5 million. In total, the film has now grossed 53.2 million since its domestic release 10 days ago. At this rate, it seems that word-of-mouth will not be strong enough to turn the film into a domestic success, given its gargantuan budget. Here are the top 10 movies at the domestic office, with international results when available, according to studio estimates: |||||Summary:","completion":"The R-rated comedy \\"21 Jump Street,\\" starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, earned an impressive 35 million on its opening weekend, topping the box office charts.

On December 4, as news came in about the discoveries in Jordan, National Security Council (NSC) Counterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke wrote Berger, \\"If George's [Tenet's] story about a planned series of UBL attacks at the Millennium is true, we will need to make some decisions NOW.\\" He told us he held several conversations with President Clinton during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\\" Mike was not diplomatic,\\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \\"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \\"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \\"The threat could not be more real. <sep>What is the president and the CIA's main goal in the article?<sep>To predict the millennium series of attacks A:","completion":"Is the answer \\"To predict the millennium series of attacks\\" valid?

Residents of Bac Giang in north-east Vietnam had never seen anything like the angry mob that choked the city's streets late last month. Thousands of people blocked the city centre for the entire afternoon. At the head of the protest was a coffin adorned with white-flower wreaths and a picture of a young man, Nguyen Van Khuong, who had died a day earlier in police custody. A video clip posted on YouTube showed a large group of men smash through the gate of the municipal People's Committee and hurl stones and rocks at the police. Security forces tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas and batons but the protesters only withdrew after the city's leaders came to negotiate with the family of the deceased man. \\"The police killed my relative Nguyen Van Khuong, there is no doubt of it,\\" said one member of the victim's family. Mr Khuong, 21, was stopped by traffic police in Bac Giang on 23 July for not wearing his motorcycle helmet and taken in for questioning. His girlfriend waited outside for more than an hour before being told that Mr Khuong had fallen ill and had been taken to hospital. When she arrived there, she was told he had passed away. \\"They just returned the body and did not provide any explanation, that's why we are so upset and decided to take his body to the People's Committee to demand [an explanation],\\" said Mr Khuong's relative. Only last week, more than 10 days after the incident, a local policeman was arrested on suspicion of causing the young man's death but the official media have not provided details on how it happened. Nguyen Van Khuong's case is the latest in a series of clashes between residents and local authorities. In May, an incident in Thanh Hoa province ended with two civilian fatalities. A 45-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy were shot when police tried to disperse a crowd protesting against a government industrial project. Dozens of people were arrested just weeks earlier in a Catholic commune in Danang during a rally by hundreds of residents against land confiscation. According to statistics released by the Government Inspectorate, during the past five years there were nearly 4,000 cases of public protest, 550 of which attracted more than 50 people. Although the main reasons for public grievance remain land policies, other causes include corruption and official wrongdoing. \\"The Vietnamese people are in general kind and peace-loving, they never want to cause trouble,\\" say Prof Tuong Lai, a leading sociologist in Vietnam. \\"They only protest when they have been pressed to the point of explosion. Like we say in Vietnamese: the dyke breaks when the flood water is too strong. \\"I don't believe they have been agitated by 'foreign reactionary forces' or 'extremist elements',\\" he says. Prof Tuong Lai says the increasing regularity of public protests indicates \\"serious problems in society\\" that need special attention from the leadership. \\"The Communist Party and the central government should make efforts to resolve social conflicts through being absolutely transparent and respectful of the laws,\\" says Prof Tuong Lai. \\"Gone is the time when [they] can shut down the media in order to conceal official wrongdoings and force their opinion on the public as there is so much information available on the internet.\\" But with the Communist Party Congress coming in less than six months, when the country's leadership for the next five years will be elected, analysts say people will want their voice heard and protests are bound to occur more often. Prof Tuong Lai warns that incidents like that in Bac Giang cannot be swept under the carpet. \\"For once, the public wants to see a responsible government that punishes wrongdoings in a most transparent manner.\\" Vietnam always takes great pride in having one of the most \\"safe and stable\\" countries in the world, Prof Tuong Lai says. But he says that public grievances might pose a grave threat to the regime if no action is taken to address them.

Answer the following question: “Please remember me to myself!” When sliding toward mania in 2016, I begged this of my therapist. He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

The city is known for its mysterious events and unsolved cases, but things have been quiet lately – almost too quiet. Step 2: Discovery of the abandoned cab While on a nightly patrol, Jimmy and his fellow officers notice a yellow cab parked in an abandoned lot – a strange sight in their neck of the woods. The cab itself, Yellow Cab 13, is notorious in the city for its history of unexplained incidents. Curious, the officers decide to investigate and to their horror, they find the dead body of the cab driver inside. Step 3: Initiate the investigation It soon becomes clear that something sinister is at play. The cab is searched for clues and its dashboard camera reveals a cryptic message, \\"The End Begins.\\" The officers consider all possibilities, from gang violence to supernatural forces.

They call themselves \\"The Keepers,\\" and have been using Yellow Cab 13 as a method to transport their high-level targets: criminals, whistleblowers, or those who pose a threat to them. The cab driver was a member of this organization, responsible for handling their dirty work.

Question: When was the airfield used? Context: In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange.

Review: I reflect back to the days when I held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when I was 16. The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years. Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments. That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter. But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth. The three main characters well played by all three actors (Kerry Wahington - Lanisha, Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations. They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day. The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models. These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day. They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with. Finding true love in a male, having good friends that you can depend on, gaining some respect/love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life. This is were this film cross the race, age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped. The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head, by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods. Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best. The one thing I know about (African Americans and Hispanics) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent. This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves. The HOPE FACTOR: I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did \` Today is a good day.' Yes poverty still exists, racism, sexism, and any other ism that we can added. Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive, everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future. I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision. I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think, reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place.

Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011. It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text shhh... let's not leak our hard work. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010. The leaked copy edition was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as \\"Windows 7\\". Milestone 2, Build 7955, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced by a new Black screen, although this was later scrapped.

The \\"Windows 7\\" logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying \\"Microsoft Confidential\\". On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later scrapped, and the circling dots as featured in the final (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber). It also had the text Welcome below them, although this was also scrapped.\\" Answer:","completion":"Before Windows 8, window text was aligned to the left instead of being centered as seen in Windows 8. This change was first introduced in Windows 8 Milestone 1, Build 7850, and marked a significant departure from previous Windows versions' text alignment within windows.

Alongside these changes, a new wallpaper with the text \\"shhh... let's not leak our hard work\\" was featured, hinting at Microsoft's desire to keep their work-in-progress under wraps. In addition to the previously mentioned changes in Build 7850, subsequent leaked builds of Windows 8 brought other alterations.

The family of a surfer who had his hand and part of his arm torn off in a shark attack have launched an appeal to help fund his long road to recovery. Sean Pollard is now in a stable condition at the Royal Perth hospital after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay, east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday. A Facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean's recovery and rehabilitation. Scroll down for video. Sean Pollard's family have launched an appeal for his long road to recovery. Department of Fisheries examinations have revealed that the bite marks on Sean Pollard's surfboard would indicate a Great White shark was responsible for the attack. A facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay on WA's south coast on Thursday. It read, 'Upon the attack he(Sean Pollard) was airlifted to RPH in Perth by the Royal Flying Doctors for further medical treatment.' 'The time ahead will be one of many challenges and he will be needing plenty of support & assistance. To assist Sean & his family, donations either small or large will be greatly appreciated.' The appeal comes as WA fisheries have revealed bite marks on the 23 year old's surfboard, indicate a Great White shark was responsible for his injuries. The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts. Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said. Surfer Sean Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia on Thursday. Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark. Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark. 'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.' An online appeal to help in Sean's recovery has also been launched and has already raised over 5000. 'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.' 'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley. WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety. 'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said. 'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials. Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible. Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident. Caution signs at key access points will remain in place, while department vessels which have been on the water will remain on patrol. Incident: The attack occurred in scenic Wylie Bay, on Western Australia's south coast. A separate online appeal has also been launched on Indiegogo Fundraiser, encouraging everyone to give generously towards Sean's recovery. Set up by Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA sharks culls campaign, it said,'Sean's medical assistance would not have been cheap at all! Let's show how much we really do care about people!' 'Every effort is being taken to get a hold of Sean's family in terms of this fundraiser, including calling Bunbury Police, South Bunbury Football Club and certain members of the media.' 'I got involved because it's a tragic incident and because of my connections with family and those who have had shark attacks before, they need all the support they can get,' said Ms Banks. So far the appeal has raised well over its 1000 goal and is at more than 5000 with more than 100 people donating. 'Blown away by the support of the community.' 'So we've been speaking to Paul De Gelder (shark attack survivor) in Sydney to see if he'll speak to Sean, depends if Sean is willing,' she said. 'Assist (fundraising money) Paul to go from Sydney to Perth, the rest will go all to medical expenses involved in surgery he has had and the treatment he's going to need, including counselling for family.' The campaign will close on October 14. The sharks campaigner says the system has let Sean down and more needs to be done to educate people in what's happening at their popular beaches. 'In Cape Town South Africa, there's a shark spotters program, flags and alerts, to alert people of shark activity.' 'We're not doing enough of this in WA. There needs to be a national view on this, I think, how can educating people harm the public,' said Ms Banks. 'Think government needs to do more for surfers and beach goers to have greater access to devices that are proven to work..., surf smart (electronic devices on surfboards), wet suits which deter sharks, these things should be available to the public at subsidised costs.' 'Why are these products not more accessible when our premier is talking public safety issues.'

Your birthday, the first day of your work or the day you win a prize. Many teenagers may think their birthday is the happiest time because they can receive many wonderful presents and have much fun with their friends. Others may regard the starting day of their work as the most meaningful. They think it's the first big step in their life and they can depend on themselves. They like to deal with challenges rather than to ask for the help of adults. According to a survey, more than half of the Chinese people, certain ages and birthdays are especially important. One hundred days after a baby's birth has special meaning. On that day, relatives and friends come to bless the baby. In northern part of China, like Inner Mongolia, a child's 12th birthday is a big day. This is when a child becomes a teenager. Eighteen is another important age, which means you must be responsible for what you have done in laws. As for adults, maybe the anniversary of their marriage is the most important.

Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more clouds that build up happens, how will it affect MORE or MORE POWERFUL lightning. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, we will examine the effect of an increase in cloud buildup on the formation and power of lightning. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the hypothesis: 1. Ice forms inside a cloud: If there are more clouds, this means there are more opportunities for ice to form inside these clouds. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges: With more clouds and more ice, there will be greater interactions between ice particles, leading to more electrostatic charges being generated. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: As more electrostatic charges build up in these clouds, the likelihood of these clouds turning into thunderclouds increases. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: With more thunderclouds, the buildup of electrostatic energy will be more significant, leading to stronger negative charges forming in these clouds. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: With stronger negative charges in the cloud, a greater amount of positive energy will likely be attracted from the surrounding environment. 6. This positive energy gathers on the ground: With stronger negative charges in the clouds, more positive energy is attracted to the ground, accumulating a larger overall charge. 7. The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning: As the charges between the ground and the cloud increase, the likelihood of lightning forming will also increase due to the stronger attraction between the positive and negative charges. In conclusion, if more clouds are introduced within the given scenario, it will most likely lead to more frequent lightning occurrences and, potentially, more powerful lightning. This is because the increase in cloud buildup creates more opportunities for ice formation and subsequent interactions, leading to increased electrostatic charges and an enhanced attraction between positive and negative charges. Thus, the perturbation hypothesis suggests a direct effect on the process of lightning formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Incandescent light bulb: In manufacturing the glass bulb, a type of \\"ribbon machine\\" is used. A continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs are created. After the bulbs are blown, and cooled, they are cut off the ribbon machine; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour. The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested. How is the evacuation tube sealed?","completion":"Okay, let me explain it simply. The evacuation tube is a little part in the glass stem that helps remove air from the light bulb. To seal it, they use a hot flame or fire that goes over it.

Question: Americans get some of their news and entertainment from public television and radio. These public media receive money to operate from private citizens, organizations and government. Many of their programs are educational. But most of the American media are run by businesses for profit. These privately owned media have changed greatly in recent years. Newspapers, magazines and traditional broadcast television organizations have lost some of their popularity. At the same time, online, cable and satellite media have increased in numbers and strength. So have media that serve racial groups and those communicating in foreign languages. In general, more media than ever now provide Americans with news and entertainment. At the same time, fewer owners control them. Huge companies have many holdings . In some areas, one company controls much of the media. One dramatic change in American media is the increased success of cable television. It comes into most homes over wires. It does not use the public airwaves to present programs, as broadcast television does. Like broadcast television, most cable television programs perform advertisements. This is true although people must pay to see cable television in their homes. Thirty years ago, few people had cable. Today, about sixty-eight percent of American homes have cable television. Television by satellite also is gaining popularity. Over the years, traditional broadcast organizations have tried to appeal to as many watchers as possible. Many cable companies, however, present programs for one special group of viewers. For example, there are cable stations for people who like books, cooking, travel, golf or comedy.

Information: - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief. - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\". - Jerry W. Jarrett Sr. (born September 4, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee) is an American promoter and former professional wrestler, and the father of wrestler Jeff Jarrett. He is the co-founder and former part-owner of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Like World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, Jarrett was initially a promoter and became a wrestler later in life. - The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in the late 1950s. - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama. - Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character also known as a \`\` gimmick '' that was originally introduced in Memphis ' Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) in 1984 . The character was based on a gang leader called \`\` the Humungus '' or at times \`\` Lord Humungus '' from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior . The original Lord Humongous was portrayed by Mike Stark , who was tall and physically impressive like the character in the movie . Since Lord Humongous always wears a Hockey mask it allowed promoters to replace the man under the mask without having to publicly acknowledge that it was someone else playing the part . The character became a recurring gimmick on the CWA but was also used in other promotions after the CWA closed . The character has been played by a number of wrestlers including Jeff Van Kamp , Sid Vicious and Barry Buchanan and Sid 's son Gunnar Eudy . - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring. - The United States Wrestling Association or USWA was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Wrestling Association. - The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is a professional wrestling governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA championship bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional \\"territory\\" system. - Continental Wrestling Association (later on Championship Wrestling Association) was a wrestling promotion managed by Jerry Jarrett. The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity. - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state. - Jeff VanCamp, Sr. is an American retired professional wrestler, who wrestled under the ring names Jeff Van Kamp/Jeff Van Camp as well as working as Lord Humongous in 1984 and 1985. He is a former NWA Alabama Heavyweight Champion and NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Champion. - Catch wrestling is a classical hybrid grappling style that was developed in Britain circa 1870 by J. G. Chambers, then later refined and popularised by the wrestlers of travelling funfairs who developed their own submission holds, or \\"hooks\\", into their wrestling to increase their effectiveness against their opponents. Catch wrestling derives from a number of different styles, the English styles of Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, Cornwall and Devon wrestling, Lancashire wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, styles of the Indian subcontinent such as Pehlwani, Jujutsu and Iranian styles such as Varzesh-e Pahlavani. The training of some modern submission wrestlers, professional wrestlers and mixed martial artists is founded in catch wrestling. - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports. - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. What is the relationship between 'lord humongous' and 'professional wrestler'? Answer:","completion":"Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character or \\"gimmick\\". It was originally introduced in Memphis' Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in 1984. The character was based on a gang leader from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. The character was physically impressive and always wore a hockey mask, allowing different wrestlers to assume the identity of Lord Humongous without needing to publicly acknowledge the change. Over the years, the character has been performed by several wrestlers, including Jeff Van Kamp, Sid Vicious, Barry Buchanan, and Sid's son, Gunnar Eudy.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

They made efforts to paint a picture of cooperation, even though there was a deep-rooted conflict between the two ideologies for many years before.

I found the following answer on Google: The princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut, having been created in the 1960s. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found is correct. Square diamonds are commonly known as \\"princess cut\\" diamonds. The princess cut is a modern and popular diamond cut which was indeed created in the 1960s. It is characterized by its square or rectangular shape, and offers a brilliant and eye-catching appearance due to its unique facet arrangement. The princess cut is the second most popular diamond cut after the round brilliant cut, and it is highly sought after for engagement rings and other jewelry items. The cut showcases the incredible sparkle and fire of a diamond while maintaining a geometric and contemporary look. This cut is particularly popular among those who appreciate a balance of brilliance and individuality; it offers a distinctive alternative to the more traditional round shape. The princess cut diamond's stunning appearance is attributed to the way it is cut, combining the classic step-cut approach with the more modern brilliant-cut technique. This combination maximizes the stone's fire, brilliance, and scintillation, creating a captivating visual effect. In addition to the princess cut, other square-shaped diamond cuts exist as well, such as the cushion cut (which has rounded corners and resembles a pillow) and the asscher cut (a square emerald cut with a high crown and deep pavilion).

The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace.

Consumed by his work, he harbors an unspoken attraction to Laura Claybourne (Samms), the selfish actress playing the lead character of Rachel Hedison. Made late to the office by a long wait for a visit by an unpleasant cable repairman, Jack crosses paths with Louise (Hemingway), an actress who is there to interview for the part of Janet DuBois, a character Jack had made plain he did not want introduced. Jack then has a contentious meeting with his co-producers, the Sherwoods. The Sherwoods reveal that they are displeased with several elements of Jack's outline for the upcoming season and wish to kill off Rachel Hedison, due to Laura's outrageous contract demands. Feigning compromise, the Sherwoods immediately hire Arnie Federman, a rival of Jack's, to make the changes they desire. At the same time, Jack has suggested a new character into the show, Jack Gates, a ruthless millionaire tycoon (\\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\") who reflects a character Jack dreams for himself. The Sherwoods make no promise of writing Jack Gates into the show, despite Jack's interest in the character. Planning an escape to Vermont for the weekend, Jack is contacted by Laura. She has just broken up with her boyfriend Dennis, the actor who plays Rachel's boyfriend Dr. Paul Kirkwood on the show, and wishes to accompany Jack. As Jack loads their luggage into his car, Dennis suddenly appears and calls out to Rachel. Jack looks up from his trunk to see them kissing passionately.

Q:Given the following context: Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces.... answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose literary style was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent? A:","completion":"The name of the person whose literary style was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent is Jean Cocteau."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot title: Stalag 17 Movie plot: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the...

Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Who is more likely to die after this event? Hint: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" A:","completion":"Michael is more likely to die after this event, as he was exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time, which can result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS).

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: On April 12 what island did Shackleton decide to travel to? , can you please find it? The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as −20 °F (−29 °C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from...

The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to 900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did Governor Keith Miller propose the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale?","completion":"Governor Keith Miller proposed the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale for a combination of reasons, primarily rooted in fiscal responsibility and ensuring a sustainable economic outlook for the state. Here are some of the key factors that contributed to his decision: 1. Anticipation of substantial oil revenues: In 1969, Alaska was on the verge of experiencing a significant windfall from the Prudhoe Bay lease sale. The sale was expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Gov. Miller believed that it was important to protect and manage these funds in an organized way for the long-term benefit of Alaskans. 2. Preventing reckless spending: Gov. Miller was concerned that if the entire proceeds from the Prudhoe Bay lease sale were made immediately available to the legislature, there was a potential risk that the funds would be rapidly spent without due consideration for the future. By proposing the establishment of the Alaska Permanent Fund, he intended to create a mechanism that would encourage responsible allocation and deployment of the petroleum wealth. 3. Economic stability: Miller sought to ensure that the revenue generated from the oil industry would not just be a one-time boost to the state's economy but would also be a steady source of funds for future generations. Establishing the Permanent Fund was a way to create a savings account for Alaska that could generate income for the state, contributing to economic stability even after the oil reserves had diminished. 4. Diversification of the state's revenue: One of the goals behind the Permanent Fund was to create a diversified source of revenue, instead of being heavily reliant on the oil industry. By investing a portion of oil royalties into this fund, the state could grow its financial assets through various investments, providing a more stable and diversified flow of income. 5. Equitable distribution of wealth: Gov. Miller, along with subsequent advocates of the Permanent Fund, wanted to make sure that all Alaskans benefitted from the state's vast oil resources. This philosophy was later materialized through the annual Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, which distributes a share of the fund's earnings directly to the state's residents. In summary, Governor Keith Miller proposed the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale to ensure responsible management of the state's oil revenues, prevent reckless spending, create a lasting savings account, diversify the state's sources of income, and provide equitable distribution of wealth among Alaskans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born on May 9, 1934, in Leeds, England, Bennett has made significant contributions to the fields of drama, screenwriting, and literature throughout his career. \\"Forty Years On\\" premiered in London's West End in 1968 at the Apollo Theatre, where it starred veteran actor John Gielgud, renowned for his work in Shakespearean theatre. The play revolves around Albion House, a British boys' school, where a retiring headmaster and an assemblage of students perform a play highlighting several moments from British history and culture. The narrative structure of \\"Forty Years On\\" is unique, with a play-within-a-play format. It comprises a series of vignettes combined with speeches made by the headmaster, who is a genuine and sincere character, as well as other members of the school staff who deliver humorous and sometimes satirical commentaries on British society and its values. Throughout his career, Alan Bennett has written numerous plays and screenplays that have been celebrated for their wit, humor, and insightful explorations of British society at different points in history. Some of his best-known works include \\"The Madness of King George\\" (the play \\"The Madness of George III\\" and its subsequent film adaptation), \\"The History Boys\\" (a play set in a boys' school similar to \\"Forty Years On\\" that won multiple awards and was also made into a film), and the television series \\"Talking Heads,\\" which features a series of monologues by various characters.

Q:I read this background article the other day: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. I am facing a new situation today: The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island had more big-beaked birds survive? A:","completion":"Using the knowledge from the background article, we can answer the question step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the information from the background article - Drought occurred on the Galápagos - Fewer seeds were available - Birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds - Birds with bigger beaks could eat seeds of all sizes - Small-beaked birds died in the drought - Big-beaked birds survived and reproduced - Average beak size in the finch population increased - Evolution by natural selection had occurred Step 2: Analyze the new situation - Explorers visited two islands (Galapagos 1 & 2), part of the same archipelago - Island 1 experienced a drought - Both islands had bird populations Step 3: Apply the information from the background article to the new situation Given the drought that occurred on Island 1, we can infer that the same sequence of events took place as in the background article. This means that birds with bigger beaks on Island 1 would have had a higher chance of survival due to their ability to eat seeds of all sizes, leading to a higher population of big-beaked birds on that island. Therefore, answering the question: Island 1, which experienced a drought, would have more big-beaked birds survive due to the increased need for larger beaks to access limited food sources, ultimately leading to natural selection favoring birds with larger beaks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Background: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. Paragraph: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for. She used to live in a city up in the mountains named Midgar. She liked living there due to the hikes she could go on and seeing the beautiful nature of the hills and mountains. The town she lives in now, Treno, is closer to sea level and is mostly flat plains and farm land. It's a change of scenery, and she hopes she starts to enjoy it more. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city has an atmosphere with less depth? A:","completion":"Midgar Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background.

From the paragraph, we know that Molly used to live in Midgar, which is up in the mountains and has now moved to the city Treno, which is closer to sea level and mostly consists of flat plains and farm land. Step 3: Compare the locations using the relevant information. Since Midgar is located in the mountains, it has a higher altitude than Treno.

Combine -930*m and -799*m on the left side of the equation: (-930 - 799) * m = -1729*m The equation becomes: -1729*m + 50278 = 331*m - 13582 Step 2: Move all m terms to one side of the equation.

This will give you an idea of if your caffeine intake is at an unhealthy level. 400 milligrams (the amount in four cups of coffee) of caffeine per day is usually considered safe for most adults. However, some people are more sensitive to it and should not even consume this much. If you consume caffeine and you have insomnia, restlessness, anxiety problems, fast heartbeat, headaches, muscle tremors, or extreme fidgeting you may be extra sensitive to caffeine and should cut back to little or no caffeine at all. This will allow you to avoid withdrawals or headaches. Caffeine is a drug that creates adrenaline surges, which your body gets used to. It could take a month to wean yourself from caffeine. If you are consuming a very high amount of caffeine, cut back slowly. Quitting quickly will cause withdrawal symptoms, like headaches. Too much refined sugar and foods with added processed sugar (candies, pop, cakes and cookies, some cereals) creates energy bursts and troughs, leaving you craving more. During the brief energy bursts, you are likely to fidget. Keep a log in a notebook, similar to your caffeine recordings, of how much refined sugar (candy, pop, cookies, etc.) you consume in a week. Fruit has some natural sugar, and this will help to slowly lower your intake of refined or artificial sugar because if you eat plenty of fruit you will crave other sugars less. Fruit is part of a healthy diet, and you should try to consume 4 servings (a serving is one piece of raw fruit the size of a baseball, or one cup of smaller fruits or 100% fruit juice) of fruit per day. If you are lacking in energy and turning to caffeine or refined sugar snacks to give you a boost, it may be because your diet is generally unhealthy. Be sure that you are consuming the right amount of a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean proteins each day. You should try to eat 4 servings of vegetables (one cup of raw or cooked veggies or vegetable juice, or 2 cups of leafy greens is one serving), 4 servings of fruit, 6-8 servings of whole grains (depending on age, gender, and activity level), 2-6 servings of lean protein (depending on age, gender, and activity level), and 2-3 servings (one cup) of dairy or dairy equivalents daily.","completion":"To determine if your caffeine intake is at an unhealthy level, keep a log for a week, documenting your daily consumption of coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate. A daily intake of 400 milligrams of caffeine (equivalent to four cups of coffee) is generally considered safe for most adults. However, some individuals may be more sensitive to caffeine and should limit their intake, especially if they experience insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, fast heartbeat, headaches, muscle tremors, or excessive fidgeting. Gradually reducing caffeine consumption over a month can help prevent withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches. In addition to monitoring caffeine intake, keep track of your consumption of refined sugar, such as candies, soda, cookies, and other processed foods. Refined sugar can cause energy peaks and troughs, leading to cravings and increased fidgeting. Consuming fruit, which contains natural sugar, can help curb cravings for refined sugar, and promote a healthier diet overall. Aim to incorporate four servings of fruit daily as part of a balanced diet. A serving is equal to one piece of raw fruit (the size of a baseball), one cup of smaller fruits or 100% fruit juice. To maintain a healthy diet, consume the following servings daily: 4 servings of vegetables (1 cup of raw or cooked vegetables, vegetable juice, or 2 cups of leafy greens), 4 servings of fruit, 6-8 servings of whole grains (depending on age, gender, and activity level), 2-6 servings of lean protein (depending on age, gender, and activity level), and 2-3 servings (1 cup) of dairy or dairy equivalents. If you find yourself reliant on caffeine or refined sugar to boost your energy, it may be an indication of an unhealthy diet. Ensuring proper consumption of various vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean proteins will help regulate your energy levels and reduce the need for unhealthy stimulants like caffeine.

The first statement implies that there is a girl who is currently in the process of going down a slide, and the second statement, while in a different tense, still conveys the same idea of the girl actively going down the slide. In a broader sense, language and communication always include some level of context to provide a clearer understanding.

Possible A: drowsiness, sleeping in, insomnia, exercise, pregnancy Why is \\"pregnancy\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"Pregnancy is an answer aligned with human common sense for the question about weight gain and going to bed early due to multiple factors associated with the physiological, emotional, and lifestyle changes that occur during pregnancy. 1. Hormonal Changes: During pregnancy, a woman's body experiences significant hormonal changes that can lead to weight gain. The increase in hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) promotes fat storage and plays a crucial role in fetal development. Additionally, hormones like relaxin, which help to relax the joints and ligaments in preparation for childbirth, can also result in weight gain as the body retains fluid. 2. Fetal Development: As the fetus grows inside a pregnant woman's body, its weight contributes to the overall weight gain of the woman, adding to the gradual increase in body weight throughout pregnancy. 3. Increased Appetite: Pregnant women often experience increased appetite, which is the body's natural response to support the development of the fetus and provide adequate nourishment. Consequently, this can lead to weight gain due to increased caloric intake. 4. Reduced Physical Activity: Due to the physical discomfort and fatigue associated with pregnancy, many women consciously or unconsciously cut down on their physical activity levels. This reduction in physical activity, along with the increased caloric intake, can contribute to weight gain. 5. Fatigue and Sleep Pattern Changes: During pregnancy, it is common for women to feel more fatigued and tired, which may cause them to go to bed earlier than usual. This is due to the increased demands on the woman's body and the need for additional rest. The feeling of fatigue can be amplified by hormonal changes, particularly in the first trimester when the body is adjusting to the pregnancy. 6. Emotional Changes: Emotional changes caused by hormonal fluctuations, stress, and anxiety related to pregnancy may also lead to weight gain. Some women may find comfort in eating during this period or decrease their regular physical activities due to emotional distress, leading to weight gain. In summary, pregnancy is an answer aligned with human common sense as it involves significant physiological, emotional, and lifestyle changes that can cause weight gain and result in pregnant women going to bed early. These factors include hormonal changes, fetal development, increased appetite, reduced physical activity, fatigue, and emotional changes that can contribute to the overall weight gain and altered sleep patterns during pregnancy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He made his debut in 1993 with the single \\"What's It to You\\", which reached Number One on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, as did its follow-up, 1994's \\"Live Until I Die\\". Both singles were included on his self-titled debut album, released in 1993 via Giant Records. He stayed with the label until its 2001 closure, later recording for Warner Bros. Records and RCA Records before joining his current label, Asylum-Curb Records, in 2007. Context: Walker released his twenty-third single, \\"Say No More\\", for Giant in early 2001. It was the first single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write \\"If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again\\", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's \\"La Bamba.\\" Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that \\"the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes you want to run right out and hug the one you love.\\" Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being \\"full of bad lyrics and overwrought production cliches.\\" In 2002, Walker wrote and recorded a song for the National Football League's expansion team, the Houston Texans. Titled \\"Football Time in Houston,\\" the song was used as the team's official fight song during its inaugural season. In an interview with CMT, he said that he donated the song to the city of Houston, and that he sings \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at the team's opening game every season. Although he had left Warner Bros. for RCA Records' Nashville division in May 2002, Warner Bros. released a Christmas music album entitled Christmas in September of the same year. It included a cover of Jose Feliciano's \\"Feliz Navidad\\", which Walker took to number 49 on the country chart in January 2003.

The premise given is: \\"I am Jon, said the man, turning back to the polished metal.\\" This statement provides information about a man, presumably named Jon, interacting with a polished metal object. However, the specific nature of the interaction or the exact object is not detailed. The 'polished metal' can be any sort of object, not necessarily a gun. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states: \\"Jon was holding a metal gun.\\" Although it indeed refers to the same person in the premise (Jon), and introduces the concept of 'metal' which is consistent with the premise, it introduces a new, specific item - a gun. The hypothesis explicitly describes Jon as holding a gun made out of metal. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis isn't deductively logical, meaning the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis could be true, but we don't have enough information in the premise to be sure. In other words, the hypothesis is making a very specific claim that isn't directly supported by the evidence provided in the premise. Additional information, or e.g. multiple premises, would be needed to logically deduce the claim made in the hypothesis from the premise(s). The assumption here, that Jon interacts with a metal object and therefore it must be a gun, is a leap in logic absent of other specific details or direct information. For instance, the polished metal could refer to numerous items like a metal table, a car, a mirror frame or any other object that can be made out of metal and polished. The premise would need to provide more specific information to imply that the polished metal is indeed a gun, to logically validate the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two U.S. women suffered miscarriages after being infected with the Zika virus, according to officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The virus, which usually causes mild symptoms including fever, rash and fatigue, has already been associated with a rare birth defect in Brazil called microcephaly. The defect is characterized by an abnormally small head and brain. Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images Officials have also been concerned that the virus could cross the placenta, an organ that develops in a woman's uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. This development could potentially lead to miscarriages. CDC officials confirmed to ABC News that the women who miscarried were being monitored by their doctors after they were diagnosed with the Zika virus. In total, at least three women in the U.S. have been infected with Zika after returning from abroad with the virus. One woman in Hawaii gave birth to a child with microcephaly in January. That woman is believed to have been exposed to the Zika virus in Brazil last year. In all three cases the Zika virus was found in the placenta. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical School, said the possibility of the virus being associated with miscarriages has been an ongoing concern for health officials. \\"There has been a concern that is it possible that this virus...could also create sufficient inflammation in the placenta such that miscarriages can occur,\\" said Schaffner, explaining that the link was not yet definitive. \\"Two cases don't make the whole story but it certainly would be biologically consistent with the [fact.]\\" Schaffner said researchers would likely look to see if there is more physical evidence of the virus being linked to miscarriages in countries where virus transmission is active. ||||| Everything you ever wanted to know about the Zika virus and its spread across North and South America. (Daron Taylor,Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) Two U.S. women who contracted the Zika virus while traveling out of the country miscarried after returning home, and the virus was found in their placentas, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. Federal health officials have not previously reported miscarriages in American travelers infected with the mosquito-borne virus while abroad. But there have been miscarriages reported in Brazil, the epicenter of a Zika epidemic that now spans nearly three dozen countries. Researchers in Salvador, Brazil's third largest city, are investigating some miscarriages and still births at three maternity hospitals for possible links to Zika. The STAT website first reported the U.S. miscarriages, based on information from the CDC's chief pathologist. The pathologist told STAT the women miscarried early in their pregnancies but provided no additional details. [Zika and sex: Seven key things you need to know about the case in Dallas] Last month, officials said a baby born in a Hawaii hospital was the first in the country with a birth defect linked to Zika. Hawaii officials said the baby's mother likely contracted the virus while living in Brazil last year and passed it on while her child was in the womb. Babies born with this rare condition, known as microcephaly, have abnormally small heads and brain abnormalities. In cases when women have one or two miscarriages, the cause is usually severe chromosomal problems, experts say. \\"It's absolutely possible for an infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, to result in a miscarriage,\\" said Zev Williams, an obstetrician-gynecologist who specializes in pregnancy loss at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \\"Whether it was caused by Zika remains to be determined,\\" he said, but urged individuals to take precautions to avoid contracting or transmitting the virus. Some virus infections in pregnancy, like Rubella or German measles infections especially early in pregnancy, can spread from the mother and infect the cells of the fetus and cause direct injury to it, said Jesse Goodman, an infectious diseases doctor at Georgetown University. Here's a look at the pandemics that made it to our shores. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) In testimony before Congress Wednesday, CDC Director Tom Frieden reiterated that the agency is learning more about Zika every day, including how it can be transmitted from mother to fetus. Increasing evidence in Brazil also is linking Zika to microcephaly and other suspected neurological complications. More than four dozen Zika cases have been confirmed in 14 states and the District of Columbia -- six involving pregnant women -- with at least another 21 cases in U.S. territories, the CDC said last Friday. Frieden also said that one U.S. case of Guillain-Barré syndrome may be linked to Zika. [Zika linked to serious eye defects in babies with microcephaly, study finds] It was unclear whether the two miscarriages were counted among the six cases involving pregnant women. Global health officials are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and the incidence of suspected neurological complications. Frieden has said the link between Zika and Guillain-Barré, which can lead to paralysis in adults, is growing stronger. Several South American countries have identified cases of the syndrome. The World Health Organization, which has designated the outbreak a \\"global public health emergency,\\" issued guidance Wednesday on how women should protect themselves against possible sexual transmission of Zika. It said that until more is known, \\"all men and women living in or returning from an area where Zika is present -- especially pregnant women and their partners -- should be counseled on the potential risks of sexual transmission and ensure safe sexual practices.\\" [NIH officials accelerate timeline for human trials of Zika vaccine, saying they will now begin in the summer] Those include the correct and consistent use of condoms, the WHO said. Last week the CDC issued its own detailed recommendations for preventing sexual transmission of the virus, including the suggestion that men who have traveled to Zika-affected regions consider abstaining from sex with their pregnant partner for the duration of the pregnancy.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing because they indicate two different actions taken by two people named Greg and Armstrong. In the first sentence, \\"Greg later was thanked by Armstrong,\\" the implication is that the individual named Armstrong expressed gratitude or gave thanks to Greg. The phrase \\"was thanked by Armstrong\\" denotes that Armstrong was the one who performed the action of thanking, making Greg the recipient of Armstrong's gratitude. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Armstrong was later thanked by Greg,\\" implies that the roles are reversed. In this case, Greg is the one expressing gratitude or giving thanks, directing his appreciation or gratitude towards Armstrong. The phrase \\"was thanked by Greg\\" signifies that Greg is the one performing the action of thanking, so it's Armstrong who is on the receiving end of Greg's gratitude.

The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, (sedimentary rocks). - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.

Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas. - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where do plants get the essential elements for photosynthesis? Context: Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Let your adult child make their own mistakes and then figure out how to fix them. This will improve their resilience and give them a sense of agency. This does not mean that you cannot be there to offer advice and help. It just means that they will have to do the work themselves and that you will not solve your adult child’s problems for them. Talk with your child about saving money, living frugally, and avoiding debt. Start doing this as early as possible. It is best to begin talking to your child about these things when they are still young. However, if you did not do this with your adult child, then you can do things to help them now. Help them come up with a weekly or monthly budget so they’ll be prepared to manage their money when they move out. Charging your child a reasonable amount of rent is a good way to prepare them for paying bills later. Offer to look over your child’s resume, do mock interviews with them, or help them pick out professional clothes. If you know people who might be able to help with networking, give your child their names and phone numbers. Avoid doing any of the actual work of job hunting. For instance, don’t call your professional contacts yourself – let your child do it. If your adult child is working hard to become less dependent on you, cheer them on. Poor self-esteem often contributes to low achievement in young adults, but genuine support and encouragement can help give your child the confidence they need to make it on their own. You might say something like, “I’m so proud of you for getting this big job interview. Even if you don’t get the job, it’s still a great start!” Failure to launch syndrome is often caused by underlying problems like mental illness or substance abuse.

Drake is now a member of military intelligence trying to track down what he believes is a sabotage ring led by a Paul Narvo. A bomber and its pilots crashed the day before. Chan offers his assistance. Chan is welcomed at the airport by New York Police Inspector Vance and, to Chan's surprise, his number two son Jimmy Chan. Chan goes to see Drake the next day at the apartment of George Kirby, where a dinner party is in progress. He finds his friend dead of poison gas in Drake's library, where he had gone to do some work. Drake's briefcase, containing all the information he had gathered about the sabotage ring, is missing.

Craig asked Joel to help him clean his Airpods case, but","completion":"Joel wasn't quite sure how to go about it. He had never cleaned an Airpods case before, but he was always up for helping a friend out. Both of them decided to look up some safe and effective ways to clean the Airpods case to avoid causing any damage. Here's the step-by-step method they came up with after researching and trying out different options: 1. Gather materials: They quickly realized that they would need some essential supplies such as a microfiber cloth, cotton swabs, isopropyl alcohol, and a soft-bristled brush or toothbrush. 2. Prepare the cleaning solution: Since the Airpods case is an electronic device, they knew it was essential to avoid using water. They decided to mix a small amount of isopropyl alcohol with an equal amount of water to create a cleaning solution that could safely clean the case without causing any damage. 3. Power off the Airpods case: To ensure safety while cleaning, they turned off the Airpods case and removed the Airpods from it. This way, they could avoid any potential electrical hazards. 4. Wipe down the exterior: They dampened the microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution and began to gently wipe down the outside of the Airpods case. The microfiber cloth helped to remove any dust and grime that had accumulated on the case's surface. 5. Clean the charging port: To clean the charging port, Joel carefully used a dry cotton swab to remove any dust and debris that had collected inside. It was essential to be gentle and not push too hard to avoid damaging the delicate components. 6. Scrub the interior: They dipped the soft-bristled brush in the cleaning solution and carefully cleaned the interior of the Airpods case, focusing on the areas where the Airpods sit. This step was crucial for removing any buildup that could affect the charging and overall functionality of the Airpods. 7. Clean the Airpods: While the case was drying, Craig and Joel took the opportunity to clean the Airpods themselves. They used a clean cotton swab dampened with the cleaning solution to clean the speaker mesh gently. For the rest of the Airpod, they used another corner of the microfiber cloth that had been dampened with the cleaning solution. 8. Dry and reassemble: Once the case and Airpods had been thoroughly cleaned, they let everything air dry for a few minutes to ensure no moisture was left. Then, they carefully placed the Airpods back in the case and turned it on to make sure everything was working correctly. In the end, their joint effort resulted in a clean and functional Airpods case. Both Joel and Craig were happy with the outcome and felt satisfied knowing they had successfully tackled a new challenge. Fueled by their sense of accomplishment, they agreed to help each other with cleaning and maintaining their electronic devices in the future as well. They shared some laughs and bonded over their newfound skills, turning a simple task into a fun and rewarding experience. This simple act not only improved the longevity of Craig's Airpods but also strengthened their friendship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoping to rebound from their last-second road loss to the Steelers, the Browns flew to M&T Bank Stadium for an AFC North rematch with the Baltimore Ravens. In the first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood as kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Browns increased its lead as RB Jamal Lewis (in his first game back in Baltimore) managed to get a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens managed to get on the board with LB Ray Lewis returning an interception 35&#160;yards for a touchdown. Fortunately, Cleveland responded with Dawson kicking a 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore took the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 2-yard TD run. Fortunately, the Browns replied with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run, while Safety Brodney Pool returned an interception 100&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens tied the game with kicker Matt Stover (a former Brown) managed to kick a 34-yard & a 41-yard field goal, while QB Kyle Boller completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling. Afterwards, Baltimore retook the lead with Stover kicking a 47-yard field goal. Cleveland tried to make a comeback, as they managed to get into field goal range. Initially, Dawson's 51-yard attempt was ruled no good. However, it turns out that the ball bounced off the left upright, went in, bounced off the support bar behind the crossbar, and then went back over the crossbar and onto the field. In the end, the Browns were awarded the field goal, tying the score at 30-30 and sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Cleveland sealed the Ravens' fate as Dawson nailed the game-winning 33-yard field goal.

However, it does not directly entail or confirm the hypothesis \\"You're right that I left out the part where Bush rigged the election in Ohio.\\" To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to consider three aspects: the context, the scope of simplification, and the logical connection. 1. Context: Without a specific context in which this conversation is taking place, it is challenging to establish a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The mention of \\"Bush\\" and \\"Ohio\\" could refer to various events or situations related to George W. Bush and the state of Ohio, like presidential campaigns, public speeches, or policy-related events. However, the ambiguity of the context and lack of direct mention of the election or its alleged rigging makes it difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 2. Scope of simplification: The premise states that the speaker oversimplified the exchange with Bush in Ohio. This suggests that the speaker's description of the event was lacking in-depth analysis or missed essential details. However, without knowing the extent of this simplification and the specific details omitted, it is impossible to determine whether the hypothesis falls within the scope of the omitted information. 3. Logical connection: Entailment suggests that the truth of one statement necessarily leads to the truth of another statement. In this case, admitting to oversimplifying an exchange does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis that the speaker left out the part where Bush rigged the election in Ohio. The hypothesis introduces new information - the alleged rigging of the election - which is not directly or logically connected to the premise of oversimplification. In summary, while the premise acknowledges an oversimplification of an exchange with Bush in Ohio, it does not directly entail the hypothesis that the speaker left out the part about Bush rigging the election in Ohio. Without a specific context, the scope of simplification, and a logical connection between the two statements, it is difficult to establish a clear relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

Gamal Abdel Nasser The Free Officers' intention was not to install themselves in government, but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy.

Answer the above question based on the context below: People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who met Busoni in Leipzig? is inside the article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A sperm and egg meet inside a woman&#x27;s fallopian tube - The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus - The zygote implants in the uterus - The zygote becomes an embryo - The embryo becomes a fetus - The fetus grows for approximately 9 months - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby grows into a child - The child becomes an adult - The adult mates with another adult - Question: suppose the woman is older and her uterus may not be as healthy happens, how will it affect LESS babies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In the scenario where a woman's uterus may not be as healthy due to her age, this can potentially lead to having fewer babies. As the uterus is a significant part of the reproductive process, any alteration to its health can affect fertility and the overall success of pregnancies. Firstly, a less healthy uterus may adversely affect the implantation of the zygote. If the uterus lining is compromised or unable to support the zygote's attachment adequately, this could result in a failed implantation and ultimately a miscarriage or inability to carry a pregnancy. Consequently, it has a direct negative impact on the chances of conceiving and carrying a healthy fetus to term, which means there would be fewer babies born. Additionally, an older woman with a potentially less healthy uterus may experience less optimal hormonal and physiological conditions for child-bearing. For instance, the hormonal changes that accompany aging can disrupt the reproductive process, and the uterus may experience decreased blood flow or changes to its structure and receptivity. These factors can further complicate conception and pregnancy, leading to a decrease in fertility. Furthermore, the perturbation in this scenario could have a more significant influence on the second effect mentioned, which refers to the zygote traveling to the uterus. If the fallopian tubes or the overall environment is not healthy or supportive enough, the chances of the zygote successfully traversing them and reaching the uterus may decrease. This can contribute to making it less likely for a woman to successfully conceive and bear a child and, therefore, have less offspring. In conclusion, the uterine health of an older woman can be expected to have a considerable effect on the possibility of having fewer babies. A less healthy uterus can negatively impact the zygote's implantation and the overall reproductive conditions needed for conception and pregnancy. The perturbation in this case influences the second effect mentioned (zygote traveling to the uterus) by making the process more challenging and leading to fewer successful conceptions and pregnancies. Overall, the effect of a less healthy uterus on having fewer babies can be described as more significant."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" is \\"kill\\", given that fires need to be in contact with the air to burn? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" is not \\"kill.\\" Rather, the answer should relate directly to the properties and conditions that affect fire behavior, given that fires are indeed in need of air (specifically, oxygen) to burn. Good air circulation tends to have several impacts on fires such as: 1. Intensify: A fire with proper air circulation will likely intensify. Oxygen is a critical factor that fuels combustion in fires. The more oxygen that a flame has access to, the more the flame is going to burn. Therefore, if a fire is in a location with ample air circulation, it can potentially burn more intensely. 2. Spread: Good air circulation can also promote the spread of fire. Since fire utilizes oxygen to sustain and drive its combustion, a steady supply of oxygen could facilitate the further spread of fire. Should wind be factored into this circulation, the potential for fire spread could be increased exponentially, as wind can carry firebrands (burning pieces of vegetative debris) several kilometers ahead of an established fire front in wildfires. 3. Burn More Efficiently: When there is proper air circulation, a fire utilizes oxygen more efficiently. With proper amounts of oxygen, a fire will typically reduce the amount of soot and other incomplete combustion products that it produces. 4. Longer Duration: When a fire has a consistent source of oxygen through good air circulation, it can potentially last longer than a fire with limited access to air. In conclusion, the right answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" would be one of the following: \\"intensify,\\" \\"spread faster,\\" \\"burn more efficiently\\" or \\"last longer\\", rather than \\"kill.\\" Always remember the role of oxygen in combustion when dealing with fires."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer a question about this article: Other legal factors that have been implemented to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child. Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing an important role in the African economy, child labour still plays an important role for many in the 20th century.

Summarize this article: Even if you’re not a fan of drinking beer by itself, what you’re eating with it can make all the difference. You may find that a Saison is surprisingly crisp and refreshing when sipped alongside a platter of broiled seafood, or that a dark, bitter stout makes the perfect companion for a juicy cheeseburger. When mingled with the flavors of a meal, a beer’s body can transform and take on new complexity. Like wine, different beers are typically recommended for pairing with different foods. With time, you’ll develop a sense of which flavor combinations you find appetizing together. Atmosphere can also play a big part in how much enjoyment you get from beer. You probably won’t get the same satisfaction from splitting a pitcher in a crowded, deafening dive bar as you would sharing with a tall one with your best friends from the comfort of your own home. If you’re not big on your surroundings, that distaste may rub off on you when it comes time to drain a pint. Stay away from places with strong smells or other unwanted distractions that might detract from your experience. Set up a tasting at your home with a friend who’s a connoisseur. They’ll be able to make recommendations and give you cues on how to savor your beer. You’re never going to appreciate beer if you convince yourself that you don’t like it. Make an effort to stop thinking of all beers in black and white terms. Once you soften your stance, you’ll be able to start judging each unique form of the beverage on its own merits. If you don’t like one style, move on to the next until something stands out to you. Try not to overthink it. It’s just a drink.","completion":"This article highlights the importance of food pairings, atmosphere, and open-mindedness when trying to appreciate beer.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Options: A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny B.

News article: Story highlights If successful, the Rosetta mission will be the first to orbit and land on a comet Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets The robotic lander Philae is due to touch down in November Could comets have brought water to the Earth? Rosetta may help answer the question After a 10-year chase taking it billions of miles across the solar system, the Rosetta spacecraft is homing in on its close encounter with a comet. Pictures of the oddly-shaped rock have already been returned but on Wednesday scientists at the European Space Agency, which is leading the project, say they hope to see images from within about 75 miles as the probe carries out the last of its braking maneuvers. If successful, the mission will notch up a series of firsts. Rosetta will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet on its journey around the sun, and in November mission controllers aim to place the robotic lander Philae on the surface -- something that has never been done before. Previous missions have performed comet fly-bys but Rosetta is different. This probe will follow the comet for more than a year, mapping and measuring how it changes as it is blasted by the sun's energy. 36 photos: Rosetta: The comet chaser 36 photos: Rosetta: The comet chaser ESA: A short-lived outburst from Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko was captured by Rosetta's OSIRIS narrow-angle camera on 29 July 2015.

Interactive: See how Rosetta chases the comet across the solar system Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and perhaps whether they brought water to the Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. \\"It really is such a step forward to anything that has come before,\\" project scientist Matt Taylor told CNN. Rosetta will soon begin mapping the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and find out more about its gravitational pull. This will help to find a suitable landing site for Philae and allow engineers to keep Rosetta in the right orbit. As comets approach the sun, any ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail. The dust produces a separate, curving tail. It's these processes that Rosetta scientists hope to be able to study from close proximity. Taylor explained that the survey will show the team what the comet nucleus looks like now and when it gets closer to the sun. \\"We'll be able to make a comparison to now, when its relatively inert, to when it's highly active ... making this measurement over a year when we're riding alongside at walking pace and observing how a comet works and interacts with the sun,\\" he said. \\"We are there for over a year to see this compete development to the extent that you may even be able to measure the decrease in the volume of the nucleus ... see how much material has left the comet.\\" Rosetta's target comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is known as a short-period comet. It reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the sun. Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to Earth to be visible until 2061. Others only return after thousands of years. Matt Taylor says it is unlikely that you will be able to see comet 67P with the naked eye but you can follow the progress of the mission on Rosetta's blog and find out more with CNN's interactive coverage. ||||| Image copyright ESA/Rosetta/MPS Image caption Rosetta has caught up with 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko Europe's Rosetta probe has arrived at a comet after a 10-year chase. In a first for space exploration, the satellite was manoeuvred alongside a speeding body to begin mapping its surface in detail. The spacecraft fired its thrusters for six and a half minutes to finally catch up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. \\"We're at the comet!\\" said Sylvain Lodiot from the European Space Agency (Esa) operations centre in Germany. \\"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion km, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, director general of Esa. Deep slumber Launched on board an Ariane rocket in March 2004, Rosetta has taken a long route around our Solar System to catch up with comet 67P. In a series of fly-pasts, the probe used the gravity of the Earth and Mars to increase its speed during the six billion km chase. Analysis by David Shukman, BBC Science Editor You could almost feel the sense of relief in the corridors that, after managing a 10-year trek through space with extraordinary accuracy, and after investing more than one billion euros, all has gone so well. The signal took nearly 23 minutes to reach us and, when it came, it was a dip in a line on a graph. But this showed that the final burn to reach the comet had finished and this key moment was the trigger for a wave of pride rather than jubilation. Getting a spacecraft to match the speed of a comet and effectively ride alongside it is a landmark in space exploration. But the hard work starts now. Read more from David here To save energy, controllers at Esa's centre in Darmstadt, Germany, put Rosetta into hibernation for 31 months. In January they successfully woke the craft from its slumber as it began the final leg of the daring encounter. For the past two months, Rosetta has been carrying out a series of manoeuvres to slow the probe down relative to its quarry. The comet is travelling at 55,000km per hour (34,2000mph). The spacecraft's speed has been adjusted so that, in relative terms, it will be flying beside the comet at a slow walking pace of 1m/sec (2.2mph, 3.6kph). At a distance of 400 million km from the Earth, messages are taking over 22 minutes to get to Rosetta. The distances involved are so great that the complex final command sequence for Wednesday's crucial thruster burn had to be issued on Monday night. \\"This arrival phase in fact is the most complex and exotic trajectory that we have ever seen,\\" said Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the French Space Agency Cnes. Rosetta will have to continue to fire its thrusters every few days to maintain a hyberbolic orbit at 100km above the rotating \\"ice mountain\\". The craft will then travel alongside the comet for the next 15 months, studying it with a range of instruments. Rosetta has been taking increasingly detailed photographs of 67P as it gets closer. The mysterious comet has been dubbed the \\"rubber duck\\", as some images seem to show the familiar shape as it twirls in space. Rosetta key facts Total cost of the mission is said to be 1.3bn euros The probe weighed in at 3,000kg at liftoff back in 2004, with over half of that made up of propellant It has two 14m long solar panels to provide electrical power The orbiter carries 11 experiments The lander, Philae, carries nine experiments including a drill to sample beneath the surface Project scientist, Dr Matt Taylor, said: \\"For me this is the sexiest, most fantastic mission there's ever been. It's ticking a number of boxes in terms of fascination, exploration, technology and science - predominantly science.\\" Harpooning a comet As it moves towards the Sun, 67P will warm up and its trailing halo of gas and dust - known as the coma - will increase, offering the orbiter the chance to do some detailed scientific work. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption This image sequence was acquired by Rosetta's science cameras on Sunday \\"We've seen evidence of the out-gassing of the coma, the outer atmosphere of the comet. This is made of dust and gas,\\" said Dr Taylor. \\"We have instruments on board that will start sniffing for this gas and taste it. We will also be collecting some of this dust and touching the coma itself. Hopefully, that will occur sometime this week.\\" The mission gets even more ambitious in November when, after moving Rosetta closer to 67P, mission controllers will attempt to put the Philae lander on the surface. The lander will use harpoons to anchor itself and will carry out a series of experiments, including drilling into the material that makes up the comet. The mission aims to add to knowledge of comets and their role in possibly ferrying the building blocks of life around the early Solar System. ||||| Wednesday marks a big moment for space exploration: After a few thruster rockets fire for a little over six minutes, a spacecraft called Rosetta will be in position to make the first-ever rendezvous with a comet.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 10 Super Mario fan theories that will make your mustache curl One rule about pop culture: If it exists, there's probably a fan theory about it. Super Mario Bros. is celebrating its 30th anniversary on Sept. 13, and not only have gamers been celebrating for the last three decades with serious gameplay, they've also been having some serious conversations about their favorite mustachioed plumber. While some of these ideas might be a little off the wall, others are just so weird, they make absolute sense. Here are just a few of the intense conspiracy theories on the Internet that fans have been tossing around their heads. Prepare to have your minds blown, Mario fans. 1. Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play.One of the most enduring fan theories online is that this entire video game world is a stage and Mario, Luigi and all their pals (and enemies) are merely players. Here are some pieces of evidence to support it: Recently, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that this theory actually has some truth to it — so theory has become fact. 2. Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother.Little Bowser Jr.'s maternity seems to be a mystery among the online gamer forums — at least among those who don't immediate point to Princess Peach, who seems to be the most likely candidate. According to the Super Mario wiki, Junior is told by his father that Peach is his mother, but she is then kidnapped by \\"evil\\" Mario during Super Mario Sunshine. 3. Luigi is always with Mario because Mario keeps his strength in check.Poor Luigi. He's often brushed off as the weak, loser brother of the popular and strong Mario — but what if the guy in green was actually a a killing machine ready to rage at any moment? One fan theory on Reddit explains that Luigi may be stronger than we think, and staying close to Mario keeps him from Hulking out. The user explains: Luigi's only fear is that he may go too far one day and hurt people on accident due to his powers running rampant. A common trait we see is his extreme fear of ghosts. The reason behind that is because ghosts have been known to have the ability to possess living beings...By staying close to his brother, he doesn't have to worry about hurting people because he knows that Mario is the most skilled fighter in existence and the only person who can stop him. Mario is the polar opposite of Luigi: a mortal man without any notable powers. Despite that, Mario is capable of fighting against villains capable of destroying dimensions, and even defeating Luigi himself several times (Super Paper Mario) using nothing but his sheer battle skill. By staying next to his brother, Luigi can make sure that if one of his many odd powers goes out of control, or he turns evil, Mario will be close enough to stop him and limit the damage. More on this particular fan theory can be found here. 4. The whole series is just Princess Peach's propaganda.Mario and his friends are just puppets and Princess Peach is the puppet master. According to one Reddit user: However, have you ever asked yourself why we're being shown a Princess Peach Point of View of our favorite game? We always believed that Peach was telling the truth, and that she was the victim and Bowser was the villain...What if Princess Peach is really just using the Mario Games (which are plays) as [propaganda] to lead you to believe that Bowser is the villain, when in reality Peach is an evil dictator who wants to oppress the people of the Mushroom Kingdom. The post explains that gamers are never shown Bowser's point of view in the games and therefore are never given a complete picture of the politics of the Mushroom Kingdom. For all we know, Princess Peach could be manipulating Mario into thinking she is kidnapped to feed into her master plan. Pretty dark. 5. Super Mario Bros. is the only time Bowser truly kidnapped Princess Peach.Working under the assumption that Super Mario Bros. is real and not a play, the original game is the only actual time Bowser kidnapped Peach \\"in real life.\\" A user on Reddit explains that Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a dream sequence, and therefore has \\"no bearing in the 'real' world.\\" And Super Mario Bros. 3 was a \\"play retelling (with embellishments) the events of Super Mario Bros. 1.\\" The user also goes into other games in the franchise: 6. Mario only went to the Mushroom Kingdom once — the rest is just him reliving his glory.Similar to the theory that Bowser only kidnapped Princess Peach once (in Super Mario Bros.), the same goes for Mario's trip to the Mushroom Kingdom. Since the original game was the only one to exist in \\"reality,\\" all of Mario's other adventures to to rescue the Princess from Bowser are simply the fevered dreams of a poor plumber reliving his glory days. The theorist on Reddit goes so far as to say Mario creates reality TV spin offs and grander marketing schemes on his whirlwind adventure, spinning greater tales and milking his fame for all it's worth. More of the user's theory can be found here. 7. Donkey Kong killed Mario and Luigi's father.One fan theory is so full of tragedy and family intrigue it would make Shakespeare blush. The Reddit user who poses this theory goes into extreme detail, but it boils down to the identity of the character, Jumpman, who looks suspiciously like Mario, in the Donkey Kong games. Here's how it works: Mario loves Princess Peach (at least at first) and lives in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Jumpman loves his wife Pauline and lives in New York City. While some have assumed Mario and Jumpman to be the same person, Mario would have had to have a major mid-life crisis to go from a New York City plumber to the savior of a magical kingdom — but what is to explain their resemblance? Jumpman is Mario and Luigi's dad. Honestly, they had to come from somewhere. Unfortunately, at the end of Donkey Kong Junior, Jumpman is the antagonist of Donkey Kong and dies at the end, killed by Donkey. In all these decades of gameplay, Mario has yet to seek revenge. The Reddit user goes into more depth on this theory here. 8. Dr. Mario is the third Mario brother.Mario has had plenty of odd jobs over the years, but something seems a little bit off about Doctor Mario from the Super Smash Bros. game. The Reddit user who introduced this theory wrote, \\"He has a similar moveset to Mario and Luigi, and while Luigi is a lighter and floatier comparison to Mario, DM is a heavier, harder hitting alternative. Doctor Mario's hair is also lighter than Mario's, taking an almost blonder or more auburn tint to the plumber's dark brown hair. Mario also seems to be more athletic than DM as he is faster and can wall jump, whereas the doctor can not.\\" It seems easy to believe that perhaps there are several Mario brothers, in several sizes, floating out there. More on this theory can be found on Reddit. 9. The coins are souls.Get ready for the most existential gameplay you've ever experienced. It turns out, every time you hit, smash, burn or generally destroy and object or enemy and you get a coin in return, what you're actually getting is that thing's soul. A user on Reddit wrote: The instruction manual for [Super Mario Bros. 1] states the the inhabitants of [Mushroom Kingdom] were turned into bricks (yes, the exact same ones that [Mario] smashed on his journey). If the bricks are [Mushroom Kingdom] residents, then how are there coins inside them. What if Mario was actually harvesting the souls of innocent toads? The theory goes into great detail on the many different and twisted ways Mario can harvest the souls of the dead for his profit. 10. Wario is a crazed Mario fan.Wario isn't such a bad guy. He just doesn't know how to process all these feelings of respect and admiration. Some evidence of Wario's devotion to Mario include: Wario's outfit is the a superfan equivalent of Mario's: overalls, white gloves, mustache and a cap with an upside down \\"M\\" (or \\"W,\\" however you want to spin it). In Super Mario Land 2, Wario lives in a castle with a statue of Mario in front. Of course, it's revealed that this place used to be Mario's own castle, but still, Wario doesn't seem to mind keeping it in tact. If that isn't love, we don't know what is. More details about Wario's deep obsession with Mario can be found here. So what's real and what's just a toad's fantasy? You decide.

Some examples include the idea that Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play, Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother, Luigi stays close to Mario to keep his strength in check, and the coins collected in the game are actually the souls of defeated characters. These theories provide different interpretations of the game's characters and storylines and showcase the creativity of the players who have formed these ideas over the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The actor and his wife Alice Kim have separated and have actually been quietly apart since January, his rep told The News. The 52-year-old and Kim, 32, would have celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary this August. They share a son, Kal-el Coppola Cage, 10. Cage also has a 25-year-old son, Weston, from his previous relationship with model Christina Fulton. Jermaine Jackson’s wife files for divorce The \\"National Treasure\\" star's first marriage was to actress Patricia Arquette from 1995 to 2001. The following year, he wed Lisa Marie Presley but the nuptials only lasted four months in 2002. Cage met his third wife when she served him at the Los Angeles restaurant, Kabuki, while she was working as a waitress. He popped the question only two months later and the pair tied the knot at a private ranch in Northern California on July 30, 2004. Their bizarrely named son was born on October 2, 2005. The couple made headlines in 2011 when a boozed-up Cage was arrested for loudly arguing with Kim and then taunting police. The charges of domestic abuse and battery were dropped three weeks later. Despite the long separation, TMZ reports the troubled couple has yet to file divorce papers.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] and the situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Answer the following question: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","completion":"A: The Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom. This lake is exposed to geothermal activity, which means that heat from the Earth's interior warms the deeper water. As a result, the bottom of the Deep lake is warmer than the surface water. This temperature difference causes convection currents to occur, further contributing to the warming of the deeper waters. In contrast, the Shallow lake has a temperature inversion caused by the mixing of saline and fresh water, making the temperature rise as a diver descends but not necessarily causing the deeper water to be warmer than the surface. Due to the geothermal activity in the Deep lake, its bottom water consistently has a warmer temperature compared to the Shallow lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At about 9:45pm I was to the point of fainting, in an effort to minimalize the number of times I ate per day in order to maximize the fun in Vegas. My companions were equally as weak and lightheaded, so we went for the closest place to eat that would accomodate our various criteria (veggie options, relatively cheap, and had to have roast beef sandwiches-as per one of our party's demands.) We were seated immediately by 9:50 and given menus. The waitress took 15 minutes to even make eye contact with our table (and it was NOT busy in this place, she was in the back room.) When we went around the table and began to order, she informed us that it is now 10:05 and that they were no longer making the food on the menu she had offered us, and that we could only order from one of the three pages we were given. WTF! We complained vociferiously that it was not our fault she was taking a snooze in the back and wasn't on her game, and that they should honour us paying customers who arrived before their cut off time and who were provided with dinner menus-not the late night menus. No go. We were stuck with appetizers only. 40 minutes later, I had my greasy chicken tenders, 3 carrot sticks and 3 sticks of celery. They did not bring the sauces (bbq and ranch) described with the item-and when I requested them the waitress looked at me as if I had just told her I wanted her to wash my car with her tongue.

We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures. For me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think.

Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. Running against incumbent Jerry Brown, who was then at the height of his popularity, Younger was the unsuccessful Republican Party nominee for Governor of California in 1978. His wife, Mildred, had a promising political career as a centrist Republican in the 1950s until she lost her voice by injuries suffered in a car crash. The Youngers' only child, Eric E. Younger, became a Superior Court Judge. - Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who was the 40th President of the United States, from 1981 to 1989. Before his presidency, he was the 33rd Governor of California, from 1967 to 1975, after a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader. - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor. - Edmund Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Brown Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician and lawyer who has served as the 39th Governor of California since 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown previously served as the 34th governor from 1975 to 1983, and is the longest-serving governor in California history. Prior to and following his first governorship, Brown served in numerous state, local and party positions, including three times a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. - The 1978 California gubernatorial election occurred on November 7 , 1978 . The Democratic incumbent , Jerry Brown , defeated the Republican nominee , Attorney General Evelle J. Younger , in a landslide . 'california gubernatorial election' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'office contested'? Choices: - governor - head of state - president Answer:","completion":"The 'California gubernatorial election' is related to the object entity 'governor' through the relation of 'office contested'. This is because the election specifically determines who will serve as the Governor of California, which is the chief executive of the California state government. The Governor is responsible for making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position is separate from those of the head of state and the president, as those titles refer to different levels of leadership and responsibilities, primarily at the federal level for the President of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On which river is Niagara Falls?","completion":"Niagara Falls is located on the Niagara River and serves as a natural boundary between the United States and Canada. The Niagara River is about 36 miles (58 kilometers) long, and it connects two of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The Niagara River originates at the outflow of Lake Erie and flows northward, with the Niagara Falls about halfway along its length. There are actually three distinct waterfalls within Niagara Falls: the largest and most famous one, the Horseshoe Falls (also called Canadian Falls), the smaller American Falls, and the adjacent relatively small Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls are predominantly on the Canadian side of the border, in the province of Ontario. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls are located on the United States side, in the state of New York. The cities that surround the falls are Niagara Falls, Ontario in Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York in the United States. Niagara Falls is a popular tourist attraction owing to its immense beauty, power, and prominence, with millions of tourists visiting every year. Besides its scenic beauty, the falls play a significant role in producing hydroelectric power, with both Canada and the United States having power stations on their respective sides. The Sir Adam Beck Power Station on the Canadian side and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant on the US side harness the energy of the falling water to generate power for their respective regions. In essence, the Niagara Falls on the Niagara River serves not only as an iconic international landmark and tourist attraction, but also as an important source of hydroelectric power for both the United States and Canada."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned.

Here is a goal: television tray Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of acquiring a television tray, there are two main approaches: purchasing a ready-made television tray or building one yourself. Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages, which I will discuss below. The most suitable method for you will depend on your specific needs, preferences, and available resources. Option 1: Purchasing a Ready-Made Television Tray Advantages: 1. Convenience: Purchasing a ready-made television tray is undoubtedly the most convenient and hassle-free option. You won't need to worry about gathering materials, cutting wood, or assembling the tray. There are plenty of stores, both online and physical, where you can find a wide variety of television trays. 2. Quality and design: You can easily find a high-quality television tray with a suitable design based on your preferences. Many companies invest in creating useful, attractive, and durable trays, ensuring they are suited for various styles and functions. 3. Time-saving: Since you won't be building a television tray from scratch, you will save time that can be allocated to other tasks or leisure activities. You can simply order or pick up the tray, unbox it, and start using it right away. 4. Warranty and customer service: Many ready-made television trays come with a warranty, which provides a level of protection and assurance for your purchase. Additionally, if you face any issues or have questions about your tray, you can reach out to the company's customer service for assistance. Disadvantages: 1. Cost: Purchasing a high-quality television tray can be more expensive than building one yourself, particularly if you're considering a high-end option or a custom design. 2. Lack of customization: While there are many designs available for purchase, you might not find one that perfectly suits your needs or taste. In this case, building your own television tray might be more appealing. 3. Environmental impact: Prefabricated items can have a larger environmental impact due to transportation and packaging. If you prefer making sustainable choices, constructing your television tray may be the better choice. Option 2: Building Your Own Television Tray Advantages: 1. Customization: Building your own television tray allows you to personalize it completely. You can choose the material, size, design, and color according to your preferences and the specific requirements of your space. 2. Cost-effective: If you have access to the necessary tools and materials, building a television tray can be a more cost-effective option, especially if you already possess some woodworking skills. 3. Sense of accomplishment: Crafting your own item provides a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that you were able to create something unique and functional. Disadvantages: 1. Time and effort: Building a television tray from scratch requires a significant investment of time and effort. The process might be challenging and frustrating, particularly if you're inexperienced or if the project encounters unexpected problems. 2. Skillset: Constructing a television tray requires some level of woodworking skill, as well as access to certain tools and materials. If you lack the necessary skills, tools, or resources, this option may be less feasible. 3. Limited warranty and customer support: When you build something yourself, you generally won't have access to a warranty or customer support. This means that if something goes wrong, you may need to fix the problem yourself or seek outside assistance. In conclusion, the best option for you depends on several factors, such as your budget, preferences, available time, and skill level. If you prioritize convenience and are willing to spend some extra money, purchasing a ready-made television tray would make more sense. On the other hand, if you want a customized design, are budget-conscious, and enjoy the fulfillment of DIY projects, constructing your own television tray may be the better choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CUNY Union Endorses de Blasio Four years ago, the union representing 25,000 faculty members and other employees at the City University of New York endorsed William C. Thompson Jr. in his underdog bid to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. This time, Mr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, was barely considered. Instead, the union, the Professional Staff Congress, announced Friday that it was backing Bill de Blasio, the New York City public advocate, in the Democratic primary. Union delegates voted for him so overwhelmingly with a show of hands, in fact, that no official tally was necessary to document his margin of victory over the apparent runner-up, John C. Liu, who is the cityâs comptroller. While the Professional Staff Congress is not as big or as organized as many labor groups, its highly educated membership is considered one of the more vociferously liberal and best informed in Democratic circles. The endorsement is also prized because the unionâs members have a track record of actually voting on Election Day. In an interview, Barbara Bowen, president of the Professional Staff Congress, cited Mr. de Blasioâs proposal to assess a tax on wealthier New Yorkers to pay for more prekindergarten and other programs, and his suggestion that 150 million worth of corporate tax breaks be ended and the money invested instead in CUNY. âWe decided that de Blasio offered a real plan for overturning the austerity politics of the city and offered a cogent strategy for increasing funding and restoring funding at all levels,â she said. As for Mr. Thompson, Ms. Bowen said some delegates felt troubled by his moderate stance on the policeâs stop-and-frisk tactic, since three-quarters of the student body are members of minorities. They also voiced skepticism about Mr. Thompsonâs pledge to not raise taxes. âI think some of our delegates felt that he has taken different positions and is a little bit of a different candidate this time,â she added. When asked about the unionâs decision, Mr. Thompson said in a statement, âI respect the members of the organization immensely and their decision wonât deter me from supporting teachers and educators in the CUNY system.â The unionâs endorsement put a bit of a damper on what had been shaping up as a banner week for Mr. Thompson in the education world. He collected endorsements from the union representing public school principals (the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators) on Tuesday and the one for teachers (the United Federation of Teachers) on Thursday. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Scuba provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE). Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers. - Technical diving (also referred to as tec diving or tech diving) is scuba diving that exceeds the agency-specified limits of recreational diving for non-professional purposes. Technical diving may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risk of serious injury or death. The risk may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The skills may be developed through appropriate specialised training and experience. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, and multiple gas sources. - Nitrox is used to a lesser extent in surface-supplied diving, as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire. - Recreational diving or sport diving is a type of diving that uses SCUBA equipment for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment . In some diving circles , the term \`\` recreational diving '' is used in contradistinction to \`\` technical diving '' , a riskier and more demanding application of the sport which requires greater levels of training , experience and equipment . - A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration.

Objective of the Pepsi company: The main objective of PepsiCo, the multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation that owns the Pepsi brand, is to be a global leader in the food and beverage industry. PepsiCo focuses on providing consumers with a wide range of enjoyable and wholesome products, while also maintaining sustainable growth. To achieve this, the company relies on six pillars: a) Innovation: PepsiCo continually invests in new products, marketing strategies, and packaging designs to keep their products fresh and appealing to consumers. b) Brand Building: The company focuses on strengthening its brands through successful marketing and advertising campaigns, ensuring that they remain top-of-mind for consumers. c) Market execution: PepsiCo strives to optimize its supply chain and retail partnerships to make products available everywhere and anytime consumers want them. d) Geographic expansion: The company actively seeks opportunities in new and emerging markets, enabling it to serve a more extensive consumer base. e) Profitable growth: PepsiCo focuses on maintaining a balance between volume growth, pricing, and cost management to ensure sustained profitability. f) Sustainability and Responsibility: As a global company, PepsiCo recognizes the importance of addressing social, environmental, and economic issues and aims to minimize its ecological footprint while positively impacting society. 2. Why is Pepsi Max so addictive? Pepsi Max is considered addictive due to several factors: a) Taste: Pepsi Max is formulated to provide a satisfying taste experience for consumers who prefer a zero-calorie, sugar-free beverage. A combination of artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and acesulfame potassium, is used to mimic the original taste of traditional Pepsi, but without the added sugar. This appealing taste can make the product addictive for some consumers. b) Caffeine: Pepsi Max contains a higher concentration of caffeine compared to the traditional Pepsi. Caffeine is known to be a stimulant that can lead to addiction in some people. It stimulates the central nervous system, providing temporary alertness and a boost in energy, making it attractive to those who need to stay focused or energized. c) Carbonation: The effervescence and fizz from carbonation can make beverages like Pepsi Max more appealing on the palate, which can contribute to an addictive sensation. d) Branding and Marketing: PepsiCo invests heavily in promoting and advertising its products. This marketing often includes the use of celebrities, catchy slogans, and appealing visuals, which can make Pepsi Max more enticing to consumers.

Here is another sentence: My father considered the commercialization of Christmas to be a sacrilege. Does the term commercialization mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"The term \\"commercialization\\" does indeed appear in both sentences, but its meaning slightly differs depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, \\"Both companies will retain control over the commercialization of their own products,\\" commercialization refers to the process of introducing, marketing, and managing a product or service in order to make it available and profitable in the market. This could involve tasks such as developing a marketing strategy, pricing, promotion, distribution, and customer support. The emphasis in this case is on a conscious effort made by the companies to bring their products to market and generate revenue from them. In the second sentence, \\"My father considered the commercialization of Christmas to be a sacrilege,\\" commercialization takes on a somewhat different meaning. Here, the term is used to describe the transformation of a cultural event or tradition into a profit-driven, market-oriented activity that potentially alters the original nature or spirit of that event or tradition. In this case, the father perceives the commercial aspects of Christmas—such as excessive advertising, extensive purchasing of material goods, and greater emphasis on shopping rather than the religious or familial aspects—as a desecration of the true meaning of the holiday. While the core concept of commercialization is present in both sentences as involving market-related or profit-driven activities, the contexts underscore different aspects of the term. In the first sentence, commercialization is depicted as a business strategy, whereas in the second sentence, it represents the possibility of an undesirable influence on cultural or traditional values.

Possible A: attached, lovable, companionable, close, likely Why is \\"companionable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Companionable\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it reflects a certain degree of social aptitude and connection, which is not typically expected from individuals known for constantly holding a remote. To better understand this perspective, we must analyze the context and implications associated with these words. 1. Context of the question: The question implies that there is a person who is habitually holding a remote, which often suggests that they are engaging in watching TV, playing video games, or other activities involving media consumption. This gives us an understanding of the individual's potential lifestyle and behavior patterns. 2. Analyzing the possible answers: a) Attached - This answer does not seem fitting, as someone constantly holding a remote may not necessarily be attached to others, and the context of attachment is ambiguous at best. b) Lovable - This trait is subjective and unrelated to whether a person holds a remote or not. c) Companionable - This is an apt answer as it describes a person who is friendly, sociable, and enjoys spending time with others. People who spend a significant amount of time holding a remote might not be perceived as engaging or focused on interpersonal relationships, as they may be perceived by others as preoccupied with their activities. d) Close - Like \\"attached,\\" this answer is ambiguous in the context of the question. It seems unrelated to whether a person is holding a remote. e) Likely - The term \\"likely\\" does not provide any information about the person's traits or characteristics; it is not relevant in the context of the given question. In conclusion, the term \\"companionable\\" aligns with human common sense in answering the question because it addresses the potential social implications of someone habitually holding a remote. People who spend a considerable amount of time engaging with media devices may be perceived as less involved in social interactions and interpersonal relationships. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that they are less likely to be described as companionable in comparison to someone who demonstrates a greater focus on social engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. After finishing Sgt. Pepper, but prior to the album's commercial release, the Beatles took an acetate disc of the album to the American singer Cass Elliot's flat off King's Road in Chelsea, where at six in the morning they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group's friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music. On 26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper was given a rushed release in the UK, where it was originally scheduled for 1 June. The US release followed on 2 June. It was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly the same for the UK and US versions. The band's eighth LP, it debuted in the UK at number one - where it stayed for 22 consecutive weeks - selling 250,000 copies during the first seven days. On 4 June, the Jimi Hendrix Experience opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with their rendition of the title track. Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and Harrison and McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: \\"The curtains flew back and [Hendrix] came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career.\\" Rolling Stone magazine's Langdon Winner recalls: The closest Western Civilization has come to unity since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was the week the Sgt. Pepper album was released. In every city in Europe and America the radio stations played [it] ... and everyone listened ... it was the most amazing thing I've ever heard. For a brief while the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young. Sgt. Pepper was widely perceived by listeners as the soundtrack to the \\"Summer of Love\\". In Riley's opinion, the album \\"drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before\\". American radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop - often from start to finish. It occupied the number one position of the Billboard Top LPs in the US for 15 weeks, from 1 July to 13 October 1967. With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt. Pepper's initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. None of its songs were issued as singles at the time.

When the action was on Max (instead of Annie) the action moved better.This is the last of this series I plan to read. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The title \\"tiresome reading\\" itself suggests that the reviewer did not have a pleasant experience with the book. Additionally, several elements within the review further substantiate the negative tone. Firstly, the reviewer states that the book was \\"very tedious\\" to read, which is a clear indication that they did not enjoy the experience. The use of the word \\"tedious\\" communicates that the book was monotonous and required considerable effort to complete. Secondly, the reviewer expresses their frustration with the \\"constant interruptions to the action\\" in the book. This reveals that they found the interruptions to be detrimental to the overall flow and pace of the story, negatively impacting their engagement with the book. Next, the reviewer discusses counting the “95 mentions of other mystery authors by page 200,” indicating that they found these references to be \\"way too intrusive.\\" This further emphasizes the negative tone, as the reviewer was bothered enough by these interruptions to actually count the number of times they occurred. Another point to consider is that the reviewer identified some positive aspects of the book, specifically mentioning that \\"when the action was on Max (instead of Annie) the action moved better.\\" However, this isolated positive comment does not outweigh the overall negative tone of the review, as it was only briefly mentioned and was not elaborated upon. Finally, the reviewer explicitly states that \\"this is the last of this series I plan to read,\\" which definitively demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the book. By choosing not to continue reading the series, the reviewer conveys a strong negative sentiment toward the book they reviewed. In conclusion, this product review has a predominantly negative tone, owing to the reviewer's description of the book as tedious, their frustration with the interruptions in the story, the intrusive mentions of other authors, and their decision to discontinue reading the series. The brief positive mention of the action focusing on Max does not negate the overall negative tone, as it was not expanded upon and was overshadowed by the cited negative aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Push the extension rod into the object for a depth measurement. Look at the digital reading.","completion":"Title: How to Use Digital Calipers: A Simple Guide for Kids Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about a super cool tool called digital calipers. These are used to measure things very accurately. They can help us find the size of different objects, like your favorite toys or even the thickness of a yummy cookie. Let's learn how to use them with some easy steps! Step 1: Make the Calipers Ready Before we start measuring, we need to make sure our digital calipers are set to zero. This is like starting a race from the same spot, so everyone gets a fair chance. To do this, press the \\"zero\\" or \\"on/off\\" button on your digital calipers, and make sure the screen shows \\"0.00\\". Step 2: Measure the Outside of an Object To find out how big something is on the outside, we need to use the calipers like a little hug. Open the jaws of the calipers (the two arms) and put them around the object you want to measure, like a toy car. Then, gently close the jaws until they touch both sides of the object. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, or you might scratch it. Step 3: Measure the Inside of an Object Sometimes, we might need to measure the inside of an object, like a tube or a ring. For this, open the jaws of the calipers and place the smaller, pointy ends inside the object. Make them touch the inner walls while being super gentle. This will help you find the inside space of the object. Step 4: Measure the Depth of an Object Digital calipers also have a superpower to measure how deep something is, like a little hole. For this, you will need to use a special part of the calipers called the extension rod (it looks like a tiny sword). Push it into the hole or space you want to measure until it can't go any further. Step 5: Read the Measurement Now that we've measured our object, let's find out what the size is. Look at the screen on the calipers, and you'll see some numbers – that's the measurement! The numbers could be in different units like inches, millimeters, or centimeters. Be sure to note down the numbers so you don’t forget. Wow, now you know how to use digital calipers! Remember these five simple steps and you'll be able to measure all sorts of fun objects. Just make sure to always be careful with your calipers and your objects, so nothing gets damaged. Have fun measuring!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

News article: Summary: The operational disclosure is notable, as mega-huge high-tech companies from Microsoft to HP to IBM vie to becoming leaders in the cloud computing movement. Finally, the world's biggest Internet services operator has disclosed just how much power it takes to run all those servers -- a number that it has been loathe to disclose previously, despite its otherwise impressive green-tech credentials. The disclosure marks an important turning point for the high-tech industry: as many companies aspire to win out in the cloud services movement -- Cisco, IBM, Dell, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are just a few of the companies drooling after Google's marketshare -- the ability to manage electricity consumption and energy-efficiency will be a critical operational measure. The number: Google reports that in 2010 year, it used 2.6 million 260 megawatt-hours of electricity. Most of that amount went to run its massive data center footprint, which it figures uses less than 1 percent of the world's electricity generation (according to an independent report). The company generated approximately 1.46 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during that year. Even Google has been mum publicly about its consumption, it has been doing something about it for years (Psssst. Google's data center efficiency secrets. Pass them on.) For example, its investments in renewable energy technologies probably are creating about 1.7 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. Between those investments and its carbon offset purchases, Google figures its impact is carbon-neutral. A post on the Google blog details how the company is opening the kimono on its electricity consumption. The blog notes: \\"We started the process of getting to zero by making sure our operations use as little energy as possible. For the past decade, energy use has been an obsession. We've designed and built some of them most efficient servers and data centers in the world -- using half the electricity of a typical data center.\\" Energy-efficiency measures of this sort will be important not just from the point of view of the green-minded among us, but because as more infrastructure technology becomes consumed as a service, the ability of a cloud service provider to be the most energy-efficient in its class will become a margin and cost advantage. So least you think this is all about environmental bleeding hearts, think again. Your procurement team will be looking at this stuff. Facebook, in face of criticism from environmental activist group Greenpeace, is also hard at work on its data center energy-efficiency through something called the Open Compute Project (Want to be as energy-efficient as Facebook? There's a spec for that). According to a ranking published earlier this year by Greenpeace, Google isn't quite the greenest cloud provider, at least from a coal-intensity point of view. According to that ranking, Yahoo!, Amazon and Microsoft perform better than Google on that measure. Frankly, I don't care whether Google or Facebook is greener, fundamentally speaking. But I do care that that this issue is finally getting the attention it requires. Related posts: ||||| Google disclosed Thursday that it continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes, but it says that in doing so, it also makes the planet greener. Every time a person runs a Google search, watches a YouTube video or sends a message through Gmail, the company’s data centers full of computers use electricity. Those data centers around the world continuously draw almost 260 million watts — about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Up to now, the company has kept statistics about its energy use secret. Industry analysts speculate it was because the information was embarrassing and would also give competitors a clue to how Google runs its operations. While the electricity figures may seem large, the company asserts that the world is a greener place because people use less energy as a result of the billions of operations carried out in Google data centers. Google says people should consider things like the amount of gasoline saved when someone conducts a Google search rather than, say, drives to the library. “They look big in the small context,” Urs Hoelzle, Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, said in an interview. Google says that people conduct over a billion searches a day and numerous other downloads and queries. But when it calculates that average energy consumption on the level of a typical user the amount is small, about 180 watt-hours a month, or the equivalent of running a 60-watt light bulb for three hours. The overall electricity figure includes all Google operations worldwide, like the energy required to run its campuses and office parks, Mr. Hoelzle added. Data centers, however, account for most of it. For years, Google maintained a wall of silence worthy of a government security agency on how much electricity the company used — a silence that experts speculated was used to cloak how quickly it was outstripping the competition in the scale and efficiency of its data centers. The electricity figures are no longer seen as a key to decoding the company’s operations, Mr. Hoelzle said. Unlike many data-driven companies, Google designs and builds most of its data centers from scratch, down to the servers using energy-saving chips and software. Noah Horowitz, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, applauded Google for releasing the figures but cautioned that despite the advent of increasingly powerful and energy-efficient computing tools, electricity use at data centers was still rising because every major corporation now relied on them. He said the figures did not include the electricity drawn by the personal computers, tablets and iPhones that use information from Google. “When we hit the Google search button,” Mr. Horowitz said, “it’s not for free.” Google also estimated that its total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, with most of that attributable to carbon fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. In part because of special arrangements the company has made to buy electricity from wind farms, Google says that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010, and estimates that figure will reach 30 percent in 2011. Google also released an estimate that an average search uses 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, a figure that may be difficult to understand intuitively. But when multiplied by Google’s estimate of more than a billion searches a day, the figure yields a somewhat surprising result: about 12.5 million watts of Google’s 260-million-watt total can be accounted for by searches, the company’s bread-and-butter service. The rest is used by Google’s other services, including YouTube, whose power consumption the company also depicted as very small. The announcement is likely to spur further competition in an industry where every company is already striving to appear “greener” than the next, said Dennis Symanski, a senior data center project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization. At professional conferences on the topic, Mr. Symanski said, “they’re all clamoring to get on the podium to claim that they have the most efficient data center.” ||||| For the first time, Google (GOOG) has revealed its global electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, part of a concerted effort to become more transparent about its energy use as it opens new data centers, purchases additional buildings, hires more employees and encourages consumers to use its cloud-based services like Gmail. The Mountain View-based Internet search giant revealed Thursday that the company consumed 2.26 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2010. In comparison, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says that the average U.S home uses about 11,000 kilowatt hours a year -- which means Google's electricity consumption is roughly equivalent to 200,000 homes. Google has 29,000 employees worldwide, owns millions of square feet of office space around the world and is about to open its latest data center in Finland. Google says it emitted 1.46 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2010 -- equivalent to the yearly emissions of 70,000 Americans. Google purchases carbon offsets for its emissions and has been \\"carbon neutral\\" since 2007. It says 25 percent of its electricity came from renewable sources in 2010, a figure expected to rise to 30 percent in 2011 and 35 percent in 2012. \\"For the last decade, energy use has been an obsession,\\" Urs Hoelzle, Google's senior vice president for technical infrastructure, wrote in a blog post. \\"We've designed and built some of the most efficient servers and data centers in the world -- using half the electricity of a typical data center.\\" Advertisement Tech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are under enormous pressure to reduce the environmental impact of their data centers and operations as more computing services -- from email to video streaming -- move to remote servers in \\"the cloud\\" and as consumers increasingly rely on mobile phones and tablets. Google is believed to be the first major tech company to publicly reveal its electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. \\"We applaud Google for fully disclosing the energy use and resultant carbon emissions from their operations,\\" said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \\"We hope their leadership results in similar disclosures on an ongoing basis from the other owners/operators of massive data centers like Microsoft, Amazon.com, IBM and the U.S. government.\\" Earlier this week, Google announced that switching to Gmail for email can be about 80 times more energy-efficient than most in-house email, thanks to Google's data centers. It also said consumers can conserve energy by watching videos on YouTube, which Google owns, rather than on DVDs. \\"You'd have to watch YouTube for three straight days for our servers to consume the amount of energy required to manufacture, package and ship a single DVD,\\" the company said in a blog post. Calculating carbon emissions is a complex exercise that can be done in a variety of ways. Google looked at both direct and indirect emissions, including the emissions from company-owned vehicles like Street View cars and shuttle buses. It also calculated its purchased electricity, employee commuting habits, business travel, server manufacturing and data center construction. Once Google gathered and crunched all the data, it was handed over to Cameron-Cole, a third-party verifier. \\"I was shocked at how hard the process is,\\" said Jolanka Nickerman, Google's director of carbon offsets. \\"No one buys carbon dioxide -- you don't have receipts for it.\\" Google's emissions are growing because the company is continuing to grow as it launches new products and hires additional employees. The company tries to mitigate that with a three-pronged strategy of reducing energy consumption, investing in and using renewable energy and purchasing carbon offsets. \\"I don't know of any other company that's done a full accounting,\\" said Jonathan Koomey, a consulting professor at Stanford who has published several studies on data centers and energy use. \\"This is clearly something Google has worked on for a long time.\\" Horowitz of the NRDC stressed that while Google has calculated the energy used to deliver its various products, consumers also use energy when they conduct Internet searches or download videos. While companies are becoming more energy-efficient, consumers also need to step up efforts to reduce their energy consumption, he said. \\"When you are shopping for a new computer, make sure it is an Energy Star-labeled product,\\" said Horowitz. \\"And make sure your computer goes into its low power sleep or standby mode when it's not in use. \\" Contact Dana Hull at 408-920-2706.

News article: Intel Ending Development of Wireless Charging For Laptops As chip giant Intel continues to slash away at some of its less successful efforts, the company has decided to end its wireless charging work. The effort to create a way to charge laptops with power beamed through the air instead over a power cord has been ongoing for years but with little to show for the investments. Last year, Intel demonstrated a limited, desk-bound system that sent power over a few inches of distance, promising it would hit the market this year but currently there is no sign it will be available for sale. Last week, four Intel intc executives resigned from positions with the AirFuel Alliance, one of several industry initiatives pushing wireless charging standards, Forbes reported on Monday. The former Intel members cited their company’s realigning of strategic priorities in emails to the alliance, according to Forbes. Intel said it would continue to work with laptop makers to “validate” their wireless charging solutions and work closely with WiTriCity, a charging startup backed by the company’s venture capital unit. “We will also support the ecosystem through continued participation in the AirFuel Alliance, but effective immediately, we will no longer pursue our own wireless charging development,” a spokeswoman said. The demise of the wireless charging effort comes after Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced a massive overhaul of the company, along with 12,000 employee layoffs, in April. New president Murthy Renduchintala, an outsider hired from Qualcomm qcom to shake things up, was conducting a review of Intel’s entire line of products, Krzanich revealed, adding that he expected to slash at least “a few” lines after hearing Renduchintala’s report. As PC sales continue to shrink at an accelerating rate, Krzanich has been shifting resources to focus on faster growing areas, such as chips for data centers and “smart” devices. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Last month came news that Intel was ending production of some of its low-end mobile chip sets aimed at smartphones.

Andy Steele lives just a few blocks from the campus of Black Hills State University in Spearfish, S.D., so commuting to class isn't the problem. But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says. But now, he sets his own schedule. At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year.

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: \\"What solution is West offering and how is it different for a plaintiff from what is already being practiced?\\" Answer: \\"That a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA instead of 30 days which places an undue burden on the plaintiff\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, sweetie, the answer is correct. Ms. Valerie West suggests that a custody order should last as long as the Protection From Abuse order—up to 18 months. Right now, a custody order must be set up within 30 days after a Protection From Abuse order. She thinks this change would make things easier for the person bringing the case, or the \\"plaintiff\\", by reducing costs, making it easier to find a lawyer, and removing the need to face the person who hurt them so soon after the incident.

However, I regret to say that my recent trip to Sunbaked Shores, a highly-recommended waterfront retreat, turned out to be a major disappointment in several troubling ways. Upon arrival at the resort, my first impression was tainted by the lackluster check-in process. The front-desk staff seemed indifferent and disorganized, with little concern for providing a welcoming atmosphere for weary travelers. They took an excruciatingly long time to process our reservation, and despite requesting weeks in advance for an ocean-view room, we were met with perplexed looks when inquiring about room availability. Ultimately, we were assigned a room with a partial view of the parking lot and noisy construction site next door. The rooms themselves left much to be desired. The outdated decor, combined with the unmistakable musty odor of damp fabrics, suggested a lack of attention to detail and housekeeping. Moreover, the walls were thin enough that even the mildest of conversations from the adjacent rooms quickly became unbearable interruptions. Sadly, even basic amenities like Wi-Fi and air conditioning were faulty and unpredictable, making a comfortable stay virtually impossible. Sunbaked Shores allegedly prides itself on being a renowned culinary destination, yet my taste buds were anything but inspired. The food was bland, overpriced, and reminiscent of generic, mass-produced meals found at budget chain restaurants. The on-site dining options also had very limited hours, leaving us with few alternatives other than venturing out of the resort for sustenance. The resort grounds, once the envy of surrounding vacation spots for their lush, well-manicured landscaping, have fallen into disrepair. The once vibrant flower beds now harbored wilted, unattended vegetation, and the grassy areas were a minefield of unruly weeds. The swimming pool appeared just as uninviting, with murky water and multiple broken lounge chairs scattered around the perimeter. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of our vacation, however, was the lack of activities and entertainment that Sunbaked Shores had promised to provide. The advertised water sports center was virtually non-existent, and the nightly performances were uninspired and amateurish at best. The absence of engaging distractions made the entirety of our stay feel like an eternal stretch of monotony. In conclusion, my expectations for Sunbaked Shores Resort were vastly let down by the subpar accommodations, lackluster service, and dismal surroundings. The overwhelming dissatisfaction with my experience has left me adamant to not only avoid returning, but also caution others in search of a vacation haven to steer clear of this disappointing destination. There are certainly far better alternatives to consider for those in search of the perfect waterfront retreat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the first quarter, the Jets flew out first with QB Chad Pennington completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with RB Ronnie Brown's 1-yard TD run. However, it was short lived as on the ensuing kickoff, RB Leon Washington returned the kick 98 yards for a touchdown. The Dolphins drew closer with kicker Jay Feely's 31-yard and 39-yard field goal. However, New York responded with Pennington completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Chris Baker. In the third quarter, the Jets increased their lead with kicker Mike Nugent's 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, New York settled with Pennington getting a 2-yard TD run. Miami nearly had a comeback as Brown got a 2-yard TD run, a 2-point conversion run, and a 22-yard TD pass from QB Trent Green. However, the Jets managed to hold on to win the game. How many yards longer was Jay Feely's first field goal over Mike Nugent's?","completion":"Alright, think of this like a little story about two teams, the Dolphins and the Jets, playing a game. The players, Jay Feely and Mike Nugent, are kicking balls to score points. Now, Jay Feely scored twice with kicks that went 31 yards and 39 yards. Mike Nugent scored with a kick that went 21 yards. To find out how much longer Jay Feely's first kick was than Mike Nugent's, we need to compare their kicks. So, let's look at the numbers: - Jay Feely's first kick: 31 yards - Mike Nugent's kick: 21 yards Now, imagine you have 31 toy blocks for Jay Feely's first kick and 21 toy blocks for Mike Nugent's kick. To see the difference, let's take away the 21 blocks of Mike Nugent's kick from the 31 blocks of Jay Feely's first kick. So, 31 - 21 = 10 That means Jay Feely's first field-goal kick was 10 yards longer than Mike Nugent's kick."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The spy hid in the bushes instead of in the flowers because the","completion":"bushes offered better concealment and a more strategic vantage point. Unlike the flowers, which were beautiful but easy to spot due to their vibrant colors and relatively short height, the bushes were dense and tall enough to obscure the spy's presence while allowing them to maintain a clear line of sight on their surroundings. Choosing the right hiding place is crucial for a spy as it could make the difference between completing a mission successfully or being discovered and captured. The bushes provided a natural cover, blending well with the environment and making it more difficult for any passerby or security personnel to notice that someone was hiding there. The thick foliage consisting of leaves and branches not only disguised the spy but also muted any sounds that might give away their position, allowing them to remain hidden and undetected. Additionally, the bushes gave the spy a wider field of vision compared to the flowers. From their position amongst the bushes, they could monitor the area comprehensively, paying particular attention to any key points of interest, entrances, or exits. This would enable them to track the movements of their target more effectively, or to observe any suspicious activities or persons who might pose a threat to their mission. Furthermore, the bushes also provided some level of physical protection. In the event of an unexpected confrontation or altercation, the spy could use the sturdy branches and vegetation as a barrier, buying them some time to either escape or defend themselves more effectively. This is something the flowers could not offer since they lack the same level of resilience and structural support. Should the need arise for a quick exit or evasion, the bushes granted the spy more options for escape routes. Concealed within the dense foliage, they could easily and swiftly move from one bush to another, staying out of sight while putting a safe distance between themselves and any pursuers. This level of maneuverability is more challenging in a field of flowers, as they stand out against the landscape and offer significantly less cover during an escape. Moreover, the bushes allowed the spy to conceal any necessary equipment, such as communication devices, weapons, or other tools needed for their mission. This versatility and adaptability make bushes a far more advantageous hiding place than the flowers in a situation where remaining undetected is crucial to the success of the mission. In conclusion, the spy opted to hide in the bushes instead of the flowers due to the numerous benefits the former offered, including better concealment, an improved vantage point for observation, enhanced cover for sudden escapes, and added physical protection. This tactical decision to hide amongst the bushes significantly increased their chances of remaining undetected and successfully completing their mission."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Paragraph: Mike is a biochemist, working for a science lab. Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would organism A see speedier or slower chemical reactions than organism B? A:","completion":"Organism A would see speedier chemical reactions than organism B. This is because organism A has enzymes, which are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions within organisms.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the highest temperature ever recorded in °C of the country with a predominantly temperate climate? ? The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.

Article: Listening to music can help me focus better. Since I discovered it two years ago,I've used music to get through boring work or to focus creatively. I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life. Listening to music with relaxing rhythms and a positive message helps you forget your work and think happy thoughts. But the results you see will depend heavily on your personal tastes. Experiment with the types of music you listen to during certain tasks. By trial and error you'll finally discover your best choice. I'm always looking for new concentration aids,so I'd love to know what type of music works best for me.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. I am facing a new situation today: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the situation. In the situation, Jason was diagnosed with cancer, which means he has abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably in his body. Charlotte, on the other hand, does not have cancer but has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Step 2: Recall information from the background article. The background article states that cancer is caused by abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably. This often leads to the formation of tumors, which are masses of abnormal tissue. Step 3: Compare the two individuals in the situation. Jason has cancer, which involves the presence of abnormal cells in his body. Meanwhile, Charlotte does not have cancer and therefore has no indication of abnormal cells associated with cancer. Her condition, high blood pressure, is not directly linked to the presence of abnormal cells. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question. Based on the comparison of the two individuals and the information from the background article, we can conclude that Jason has more abnormal cells in his body due to his cancer diagnosis.

In order to accurately determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need information regarding the student population or enrollment numbers. However, considering that LYU offers a wide range of undergraduate degrees (62) across diverse disciplines, it can potentially cater to a large number of students since there may be a greater likelihood of students finding their preferred area of study. Similarly, since LYU is a public university, it might attract more students due to the perceived affordability compared to private institutions. On the other hand, the overall size of the campus and facilities could be limited, which could constrain the number of students it can accommodate.

Meeting new neighbors presents us with opportunities for personal growth, cultural exchange, and the development of interpersonal relationships. Other options such as making new friends, having new experiences, looking around, and experiencing a change of surroundings may also arise from the same situation, but they are all encompassed within the broader concept of finding the situation \\"interesting.\\" A primary reason for finding new neighbors interesting is the potential for developing new friendships. Getting to know the people living next door can create a sense of community and foster genuine connections. As human beings, we have a natural inclination to seek companionship and support from those around us. Forming bonds with our neighbors can lead to a more enjoyable living experience as well as a network of support in the various aspects of daily life. In addition to forming new friendships, meeting new neighbors can lead to a range of new experiences. People often have diverse interests, hobbies, or activities that may be unknown to us. By engaging with our new neighbors and learning about their ways of life, we can expand our own knowledge and gain insight into novel perspectives. These experiences may also include invitations to cultural events, community gatherings, or other social activities that can enrich our lives and enhance our understanding of the world. Encountering new neighbors also prompts us to look around and be more observant of our surroundings. As individuals, we sometimes become so involved in our own lives and routines that we may not pay attention to changes in our environment. The presence of new neighbors serves as a reminder to be attentive to the dynamics of our community and maintain a more active engagement with the world beyond our private lives. A change of surroundings, another option mentioned, is also a significant aspect of welcoming new residents to the neighborhood. The process may bring alterations to the aesthetics of the neighborhood, as newcomers personalize their homes, gardens, and outdoor spaces. These changes can be exciting, as they introduce elements of novelty and variety into a previously familiar environment. This fresh perspective on our surroundings encourages us to appreciate and adapt to the continuous transformation that occurs within our communities. In conclusion, witnessing new people move in next door can be considered interesting, as it allows for the potential development of meaningful relationships, exposure to new experiences, increased attentiveness to our surroundings, and the opportunity to embrace change within our communities.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddamus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride).

Write a title for this article: There will be no baggies of pot awaiting patients next week, when Minnesota joins 21 other states in offering medical marijuana. No glass pipes, no plants to tend at home. Instead, the nation’s latest medical marijuana programme is a world of pill bottles and vials of marijuana-infused oil. For the qualifying patients seeking relief from pain, medical marijuana advocates and some lawmakers, Wednesday isn’t the finish line, but the first step. The state’s restrictive approach, unseen in the industry, is likely to mean high costs, long drives and reluctant doctors. “The door is opening,” said Bob Cappechi of the Marijuana Policy Project, a national outfit that pushes to loosen marijuana laws. “This will start helping people out. That’s really what this is all about.” Minnesota’s medical marijuana advocates snatched an unlikely victory from the legislature last year after years of failed efforts, but there was little celebration. What emerged to assuage skeptical law enforcement lobbyists and a wary governor was one of the strictest programs in the nation. Smoking the plant is forbidden. Pills, oils and vapors are only available to patients suffering from severe conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, HIV and Aids. And the medicine can only be sold in eight locations, hundreds of miles away from some in Minnesota’s rural expanses. The two companies growing, cultivating and selling marijuana for the state say Minnesota stands out for its medical approach to a nearly 20-year-old industry that uses terms like “budtender” (salesmen) and “California Kush” (a strain of marijuana). “The industry doesn’t do it this way,” Dr. Kyle Kingsley said just days before opening Minnesota Medical Solutions’ first dispensing clinic in Minneapolis. “It’s all new.” Kathy Schroeder’s difficult path shows how the medical polishes on Minnesota’s program look more like hurdles to some patients. On paper, her multiple sclerosis and glaucoma – two of the nine conditions that qualify – made her a perfect fit. But like many residents, the 63-year-old struggled to get a doctor’s signature to sign up for the program. Prodding a second doctor paid off for her, but Schroeder isn’t sure whether she can even afford a month’s worth of medicine, which Kinglsey said may sell for up to 600. Still, she’ll make the 180-mile round trip Wednesday from her home near Rochester to MinnMed’s Minneapolis facility. “I knew it was going to be bad, I had no idea it was going to be this bad,” her daughter, Maren Schroeder, said. State representative Carly Melin sympathizes. The Democrat faced criticism for watering down her medical marijuana bill to get police and Governor Mark Dayton on board. “We weren’t going to get anything done if we didn’t pass this law,” Melin said. Kinglsey said he’s confident doctors and hospital systems will eventually approve, but it’s made for a slow start to a program that’s supposed to sign up 5,000 people. As of Friday morning, just 65 patients were completely registered and another 74 were being processed. Cappechi and other advocates already have ideas for how to improve it: allow more than eight dispensaries, add more manufacturers and patients who suffer from chronic pain, and perhaps lift the ban on smoking the drug.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Poor physical fitness of cancer survivors increases recurrence risk Many cancer survivors fail to get adequate exercise and nutrition following their diagnosis, putting them at risk of health problems and their cancer returning, finds a new study. \\"Even small changes can make a difference for patients, such as including a moderate amount of exercise and healthy eating in their treatment and recovery period, if and when they can,\\" said Dr. Kerry Courneya, professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of Alberta, in a release. Researchers at theÂ university looked at self-reported data gleaned from a 2005 Community Health Survey that showed that of the 114,000 adults studied, only 21 per cent of cancer survivors are physically active. In general, 25 per cent of Canadians are physically fit. Eighteen per cent of cancer survivors are obese â versus 15 per cent of Canadians in general. Male cancer survivors (62 per cent) were more likely to be overweight or obese than female cancer survivors (47 per cent). Middle-aged survivors â those aged 40 to 66 â were less likely to be active than those under 40. Colorectal cancer, breast cancer and female melanoma survivors were the least likely to participate in physical activity while the highest levels of activity â and lowest levels of obesity â were reported by prostate cancer survivors and skin cancer survivors. Physical activity is defined as walking for one hour a day, according to the study. Obese refers to a body mass index of 30 or more. \\"We know that physical inactivity and obesity are risk factors for developing cancer,\\" said Courneya. The study recommends that community-based programs be introduced to encourage cancer survivors to develop more active lifestyles.

That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star. The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning. A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as \\"enlightened\\" cinephiles make it out to be. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review in question can be identified as negative in nature. A detailed analysis of the review can provide various reasons that point towards this conclusion. 1. The author of the review only assigns one star for Scorsese's ability to reproduce violence realistically, which implies dissatisfaction with this aspect of the film. The use of the word \\"only\\" suggests that the reviewer is not highly impressed with Scorsese's representation of violence and limits the recognition of his talent in this area. 2. The negative language used throughout the review highlights the reviewer's overall disapproval. Phrases like \\"not worth mentioning\\" and \\"contrived direction\\" bring attention to the author's low opinion of \\"Taxi Driver.\\" By describing the film's various elements in terms like \\"hookers\\" and \\"pimps,\\" the reviewer underscores their distaste for the thematic content of the movie as well. 3. The reviewer further criticizes the film for being \\"a perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.\\" This statement suggests that the author believes the film is overrated and fails to offer any profound or meaningful message beyond its violent imagery. 4. Moreover, the reviewer compares \\"Taxi Driver\\" to the experiences enjoyed by \\"enlightened\\" cinephiles and implies that the film falls short of living up to such a high standard. By placing \\"enlightened\\" within quotation marks, the reviewer seems to express sarcasm and takes a jab at those who insist that the film is exceptional or noteworthy. The phrase \\"not nearly as good\\" also indicates that the reviewer does not consider \\"Taxi Driver\\" to be a high-quality, superior film. In summary, this review offers a negative perspective on Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver.\\" The author is critical of the film's use of violence and harsh themes, challenges the artistic value behind the movie, and questions its status as an esteemed film among the cinematic community. These points, along with the predominantly negative language and the low star rating mentioned, leave little doubt that the review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Henry Marshall Ashby was a Confederate States Army colonel who served under what former United States Secretary of War? A:","completion":"Henry Marshall Ashby was a Confederate States Army colonel who served under the former United States Secretary of War John Buchanan Floyd. Floyd, who held the position of Secretary of War from 1857 to 1860 under President James Buchanan, resigned from his post as tensions rose between the North and the South leading up to the American Civil War. Subsequently, he accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. John Buchanan Floyd had a diverse background, having served as the 31st governor of Virginia from 1849 to 1852 before becoming the Secretary of War. During his tenure as Secretary of War, Floyd was involved in various controversies, including the loss of federal funds and weapons that ended up in the hands of the Confederates. His actions prompted a congressional investigation, ultimately leading to his resignation. Henry Marshall Ashby, on the other hand, was a prominent figure in the Confederate forces, particularly in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Born in 1828 in Kentucky, Ashby was a planter and lawyer by profession. Upon the outbreak of the war, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and was commissioned as a colonel in the 6th Kentucky Infantry. He was later given command of the 26th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. Under the command of General Floyd, Ashby served in several crucial engagements, such as: 1. Battle of Fort Donelson (1862): Floyd, along with Generals Gideon Pillow and Simon Bolivar Buckner, attempted to defend this strategically important fort near the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. However, the Confederate forces were compelled to surrender after a series of prolonged engagements with Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant. 2. The Battle of Chickamauga (1863): Despite General Floyd's removal from active duty after the Fort Donelson debacle, Ashby continued his service in the Confederate Army as part of the Army of Tennessee. He saw action at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863, one of the most significant and bloodiest battles of the Civil War, where his unit was heavily engaged in the fighting. Henry Marshall Ashby proved to be a dedicated and competent military leader during his service in the Confederate Army, and he provided valuable contributions to the Confederacy's war efforts. Although he served under a controversial figure like John Buchanan Floyd, Ashby's actions and reputation established him as a respected figure within the Confederate forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation -20 = -6*h + 10, and we want to find the value of h. Step 1: Move the '+ 10' to the other side of the equation by subtracting 10 from both sides. This gives us: -20 - 10 = -6*h Now the equation looks like this: -30 = -6*h Step 2: Now we need to get h by itself. To do that, we must divide both sides of the equation by -6 (because -6 is multiplied by h). This gives us: -30 / -6 = (-6 * h) / -6 Step 3: Do the division on both sides 5 = h So, h = 5.

A genetic test that can predict whether a person is likely to live long enough to see their 100th birthday has been developed by scientists. Researchers at Boston University claim the test can identify those who can look forward to an exceptionally long life with 77% accuracy. They designed the test after a major study into the genetic makeup of centenarians highlighted a host of DNA variants that boost a person's chances of reaching a ripe old age. Many of the genetic markers the scientists found stave off common, and often lethal, age-related diseases, such as heart disease, dementia and high blood pressure. The US researchers investigated the genetic secrets of a longer life after studies showed that living beyond 100 often runs in families. \\"These families might share healthy lifestyles, but it also suggests there is a strong genetic background to exceptional longevity,\\" said Professor Paola Sebastiani, a biostatistician at Boston University school for public health. Lifespan is governed by a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment, with factors like smoking, diet, exercise and pollution all having a role, but many scientists believe that living beyond the mid-90s is largely down to having good genes. Sebastiani and colleagues scanned the genomes of 1,055 centenarians and compared them with scans from 1,267 normal, healthy people. They found 150 DNA variants that were more common in the old-aged group and seemed to make their bodies healthier and more resilient. The centenarians could be divided into 19 groups based on their genetic makeup. One of these groups was particularly resistant to age-related diseases and contained nearly half of all the centenarians that lived to 110 years or more. \\"There are particular combinations of these genetic variants that allow people to live not only a longer life, but also a healthier life. In centenarians, disability and disease tend to be delayed until the very end of their lives,\\" Sebastiani said. The study, published in the US journal Science, will help researchers unravel why and how the body ages and potentially lead to drugs that can slow down the ageing process. \\"If we can pinpoint genetic variants that delay the onset of diseases, it could have very important medical implications for the population in general,\\" said Sebastiani. One intriguing finding in the study was that gene variants that raise a person's risk of disease may matter less than genes that protect against disease. The scientists found that centenarians had roughly the same number of high-risk genes as the rest of the population, but had more protective genes to cancel them out. The finding is important, because commercial genetic tests look only for genes that raise a person's disease risk, rather than reduce it. The study looked only at Caucasians, but Sebastiani said scientists should now look for DNA markers of longevity in other populations, such as Africans and Asians. Jeffrey Barrett, an expert on disease genetics at the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Institute near Cambridge, said the test might turn out to be less accurate when it is independently verified. \\"Some of the genetic variants in this study are claimed to have much, much stronger effects on longevity than we've seen in similar studies of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. For instance, the strongest single effect makes someone 10 times more likely than average to be extremely long-lived, compared to other complex diseases where typical variants only make someone, say, one and a half times as likely to be diabetic,\\" he said. \\"Subtle biases in their work could contribute to these surprisingly large effects, which would make the test seem more accurate than it really is. Evaluation of the test by an independent laboratory will be the ultimate test of its accuracy,\\" he added. ||||| By Carolyn Y. Johnson Globe Staff LEOMINSTER -- Five months shy of his 100th birthday, Louis Charpentier still rises every day at 9 a.m. to spend hours in his basement shop, carving delicate wooden figurines. Years after most people's bodies and minds have failed, Charpentier climbs stairs with ease and recalls everything from the latest episode of \\"Dr. Phil\\" to the first train he ever saw, carrying soldiers who fought in World War I. For years, scientists have been fascinated by people like Charpentier, who have not only a rich trove of experience, but are also biological outliers that scientists are studying to begin to unlock the secrets of longevity. Now, using cutting-edge genomics techniques on a group of 1,055 people born near the turn of the last century, a team of scientists from Boston University has identified a genetic signature of longevity. In work published online today by the journal Science, researchers reported that 150 spots in the genome are associated with extremely long life, and can be used to predict with 77 percent accuracy whether someone is likely to live to be exceptionally old. \\"Exceptional longevity is not this vacuous entity that no one can figure out. I think we’ve made quite some inroads here in terms of demonstrating a pretty important genetic component to this wonderful trait,\\" said Dr. Thomas Perls, the senior author of the paper and the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston Medical Center. The goal is to use the data to investigate what genes play a role in longevity, and to understand how it is that centenarians live so long and stay free of disease or disability. Researchers hope that lessons learned from extremely long-lived people could point to new ways to help everyone else age healthier. Perls was quick to add that the present study examines the genetic basis of healthy aging, and that it would be premature for people to buy a genetic test to predict their longevity. Companies that offer genetic tests directly to consumers already tell people if they carry genetic variations that hold risk for diseases or traits ranging from Parkinson's disease to lactose intolerance have already drawn criticism from some scientists and doctors, and the US Food and Drug Administration recently wrote letters to several companies that already offer such tests, requiring them to seek regulatory approval. \\"You could conceivably produce a chip that would help predict people’s genetic predisposition to exceptional longevity. But I and all the authors of the paper want to instill a great deal of caution,\\" Perls said. \\"I start worrying a bit bout what insurance companies and others might do with that information -- I, for one, think it’s not ready from a social point of view.\\" In order to uncover genetic markers associated with extremely long life, researchers used statistical tools to analyze genetic samples from 801 people, aged 95 to 119. Led by Paola Sebastiani of the Boston University School of Public Health, the team looked at 300,000 spots in the genome of the centenarians and compared them with others to find variations that were associated with longevity. They found 150 areas in the genome that were associated with longevity, and then tested their tool on a separate group of 254 centenarians and 341 people who were born later. They found that they could predict with 77 percent accuracy whether or not the people were exceptionally long-lived. Researchers not involved in the research said the new work provides an interesting glimpse of exceptional longevity, but no fast and easy fountain of youth. \\"I would say you could either see this as the glass being half-empty or half-full,\\" said Leonard Guarente, a biology professor at MIT who does aging research. The half-full scenario is there are now many new genetic spots to investigate that have something to do with exceptional longevity, he said. \\"The glass half-empty would say the analysis of these people is already bewilderingly complex and we're never going to make any headway with this approach.\\" The results will also have to be replicated in other groups of people to see if they hold up. The ideal analysis would have looked for genetic differences between people who lived to be 100, compared with people born at the same time and died younger, but those people have long since died. Dr. David Altshuler, a core member of the Broad Institute, a Cambridge genetics research center, said in an e-mail that the results were somewhat surprising, because when researchers have looked for the genetic underpinnings of common diseases, they do not usually find such a strong signal. \\"I would have guessed that longevity would be even more complex,\\" Altshuler wrote. It's clear that lifestyle and environment play a large part in a person's longevity. In studies of twins, researchers have found that 20 to 30 percent of a person's longevity is influenced by genes. But when it comes to extremely long life, genetics seems to play a critical role. The spry, neatly-dressed Charpentier doesn't know how to explain his longevity. His parents lived to be 72 and 85, and he lives healthily. He doesn't drink, he watches what he eats, and he quit smoking cigars 40 years ago. He wasn't involved in the genetic study published yesterday, but -- about to join the rare ranks of the one in 6,000 people who live to 100 -- is one of the subjects being studied by scientists. Things aren't perfect -- he's a little less steady on his feet than he used to be, and can't lift weights like he did when he was young. But he still works in his shop, lives on his own, and remembers in detail the thoughts and experiences he had as a little boy. \\"I feel I'm almost the same as when I was younger,\\" Charpentier said. \\"If it keeps on like I am now, I don't mind if I live to be 110.\\" E-mail Carolyn Y.

Some find that using two hands on their backhand leads to a more accurate and powerful shot. Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net. Make a split step from the ready position to help you to get into position for the two-handed backhand. The split step is a small hop about an inch (2.5 cm) off the tennis court to load up in your legs. Your weight should be evenly divided over both your legs and they should feel like springs so that you can push off explosively to whichever direction you need. Your split step should occur right before your opponent makes contact with the ball. This enables you to be ready to chase down the ball as soon as you know where it is going to hit. This is the first step of the two-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. From the split step take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot and putting all your weight on your left. As you step forward your body and shoulders will begin turning sideways. All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Your arms should not be turning back during this step. They should stay directly in front of your chest. It is very important that your arms are not used during this step. The two-handed backhand grip uses a Continental grip for your dominant (right for right-handers) hand and a Semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant (left for left-handers) hand. The non-dominant hand will be just above your dominant hand. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders. To achieve the Continental grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket. Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side top, and close your hand around it squarely. The sloped side should go diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. To achieve the Semi-Western forehand grip you will place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the bottom left slanted facet of the grip and close your hand around the grip. The same slanted face should point diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm beneath your pinkie. The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways. You should be looking over your shoulders at the ball at this point. These three things should all occur at once. Let your racket drop down as you push off with your back foot, lifting your heel off the ground. At the same time your upper body should rotate towards the net; lifting your heel will help you to rotate your upper body. This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. You have the option of taking a small step forward with your front foot at the same time but this is optional. For beginners it is a good idea to take this small step forward at the same time. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. Your racket will follow a C shaped path as it travels towards the point of contact. You should make contact in front of your body. Your upper body will rotate back towards the net as you make your swing. Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact. Make sure contact is made in front of your body and at waist height to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Your strings should be flat on the back of the ball and so directly facing the net. After the contact point you should extend the racket in the direction you are hitting and then rotate your upper body. Continue rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, until you bend your elbows and bring the racket up over your shoulder. You want your follow through to be one easy motion so that the deceleration of the racket is smooth. Your shoulders should be facing the net by the end of your follow through. Your racket should end up over your right shoulder when you are finished following through. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to hit a two-handed backhand in tennis. It explains the steps to get ready, the correct grip for your hands, how to turn your body, and how to swing and follow through with your shot to make a powerful and accurate backhand.

The verb 'asaltar' is a proper translation for 'assault', as it indicates a sudden and violent attack, which is the sense given in the source text. \\"Due to the fact that\\" is translated to \\"debido al hecho de que,\\" which conveys the same cause-and-effect relationship between the Semites' assault and the occurrence described next. \\"Its walls were miraculously pulled down without fighting.\\" is \\"sus muros fueron milagrosamente derribados sin lucha alguna.\\" The verb 'derribar' was used because it refers specifically to the action of bringing down a structure, paralleling the English 'pulled down.'

The simplified equation becomes: -37*m + 394 = -309 Step 3: To isolate the variable m, we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 394 from both sides: -37*m + 394 - 394 = -309 - 394 This simplifies the equation to: -37*m = -703 Step 4: To find the value of m, divide both sides of the equation by -37: (-37*m) / -37 = -703 / -37 This further simplifies to: m = 19 Therefore, the solution to the equation is m = 19."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik developed a regular postal service. Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles (19 km) each and each stage had horses, donkeys or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time. Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar, the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year.

Frank Victor Swift (26 December 1913 - 6 February 1958) was an English footballer, who played as a goalkeeper for Manchester City and England. After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2-1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. During the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4-0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8-4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour. In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985. By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948-49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.

Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of the demons, is nigh. The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens, a fearsome group of warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child (In a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn). One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy/Swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. In fact, there's nothing typical about Ashura. It is a hodge-podge of many different genre's of film. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre's fairly respectfully (Although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous, but really fun popcorn movie. To be sure, there are flaws in the film. Some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place. And the acting isn't the greatest. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy/Swordplay/Comedy films for the great acting performances?? No, we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals, all of which Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. Bottom line; the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.

While he was a memorable teacher at Washington and Lee University, and as judge of the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands ordered that woman voters must be registered, he later came to hold what some thought were eccentric views on religion. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Albert Levitt never set foot in a courtroom or classroom.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that \\"Albert Levitt never set foot in a courtroom or classroom.\\" In fact, the paragraph states the opposite, providing evidence that Albert Levitt was an active participant in both courtroom and classroom settings. Firstly, the paragraph mentions that Albert Levitt was a judge of the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands. This position entails that he must have spent a significant amount of time in courtrooms, as his role involved hearing and deciding cases. Furthermore, his decision ordering that women voters must be registered is a clear example of his presence and influence in the courtroom. Secondly, Levitt was a law professor and a memorable teacher at Washington and Lee University. This implies that he spent time in classrooms, where he would have engaged in teaching and interacting with students. As a law professor, his job would have involved not only preparing and delivering lectures but also participating in class discussions, mentoring students, and evaluating their work. In addition to these professional roles, the paragraph also mentions that Albert Levitt was an attorney and a candidate for political office. These roles further support the notion that he was an active participant in legal and public spheres, rather than being a passive observer. In conclusion, based on the provided information, we can confidently assert that Albert Levitt was an experienced professional who was actively involved in both courtroom and classroom settings. The statement \\"Albert Levitt never set foot in a courtroom or classroom\\" cannot be supported by the facts presented in the paragraph and goes against the evidence of Levitt's career and accomplishments."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Given the following passage \\"The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962.

(CNN) -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. \\"When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price.

Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Paragraph: Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why can't girls stand & pee? How difficult is it for women to pee standing up? Do those questions have the same meaning? Options are: -- no. -- yes.","completion":"No, the two questions do not have the exact same meaning, although they are closely related. The first question specifically asks why girls cannot stand and pee, while the second question explores the level of difficulty women encounter when attempting to pee standing up. To address the first question, girls cannot stand and pee primarily due to their anatomical differences from males. Female urinary anatomy consists of a shorter urethra and a more internal urethral opening. The urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body, is directed downward and forward in females, making it more challenging to aim the urine stream away from the body. Moreover, the female urethra has a wider opening and is closer to the vagina, which adds to the difficulty of controlling the flow and direction of the urine stream. Now, let's discuss the second question. It is difficult, but not impossible, for women to pee standing up. To do so, they would need to utilize specific techniques and sometimes even special equipment. A woman must spread her legs wide, use her fingers to separate the labia, and adjust her body position to achieve the desired angle for the urine to flow away from her body. For most women, this method does not come naturally and may require practice to achieve the desired outcome without causing mess or discomfort. There are devices known as female urination devices (FUDs) or \\"pee funnels\\" available that enable women to urinate while standing. These devices are designed to fit over the female genital area and channel the urine stream away from the body. When used correctly, FUDs can be a convenient and hygienic solution for women who prefer or need to urinate while standing up. Some women opt to use them for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or in situations where cleanliness of public restrooms is a concern. These devices could make it easier for women to pee standing up, although using them may still require practice and some level of dexterity. In summary, the two questions presented - the inability of girls to stand and pee and the challenges faced by women in doing so – are closely related but not exactly the same. While anatomical differences make it inherently more difficult for women to urinate standing up, it is not impossible for them to do so, especially if they utilize specific techniques or opt for female urination devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

Six of the seven living species occur in the Old World , but the maguari stork has a South American range . In addition , fossils suggest that Ciconia storks were somewhat more common in the tropical Americas in prehistoric times . These are large storks , typically 100 cm tall , with a 180 cm wingspan and a long thick bill . Members of this genus are more variable in plumage than other storks , but several species have black upper bodies and wings , and white belly and undertail . Juveniles are a duller , browner version of the adult . Ciconia storks are gregarious and colonial breeders , and pairs stay together for life . They typically build large stick nests in trees , although the maguari stork will nest on the ground and at least three species will construct their nests on human habitations . One of these , the white stork , is probably the best known of all storks , with a wealth of legend and folklore associated with this familiar visitor to Europe . These storks feed on frogs , insects , young birds , lizards and rodents . They fly with the neck outstretched , like most other storks , but unlike herons which retract their neck in flight . The migratory species like the white stork and the black stork soar on broad wings and rely on thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight . Since thermals only form over land , these storks , like large raptors , must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points , and many of these birds can be seen going through the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosphorus on migration . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

Twitter activists think they know A small group of activists pushed the burning of black churches in the American south onto the news agenda, although it's unclear whether the incidents are linked or what the motivation is behind them. It's a mystery - or rather, mysteries - spread across a huge region. At least seven African-American churches have been burnt in the southern US over the last two weeks. Arson has been implicated in at least three of the blazes, but officials say there's not yet any evidence that the fires are linked. But coming as they did after a mass shooting in Charleston in South Carolina, and a resulting backlash against the Confederate flag, activists behind the protests in Ferguson, Baltimore and elsewhere had no doubt that the fires were retaliation attacks against historically black places of worship, and they took to social media to vent their anger. A co-ordinated effort on Twitter earlier in the week turned the hashtag \\"Who is burning black churches?\\" into a worldwide trend, and it's since been mentioned more than 300,000 times. The phrase, however, is slightly misleading - instead of trying to get to the bottom of who might have been behind the fires, most of the messages Tweeted under the hashtag criticised mainstream US media outlets, claiming that they were ignoring or downplaying the story. \\"I live in knoxville [in Tennessee] and had to hear about a black church being burned IN MY CITY from twitter thanks local news,\\" one man tweeted. The campaign was the brainchild of a relatively small group of activists, many of whom identify themselves on their Twitter profiles as supporters of Black Lives Matter, a movement that originally sprung up to protest alleged police brutality and the shootings of African-Americans. It became a political force last year during protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer. One of the activists who rose to prominence after live streaming events in Ferguson, Palestinian-American and St Louis native Bassem Masri, was also one of the main Twitter users behind the \\"Who is burning black churches?\\" hashtag. \\"We circulated the idea through [direct messages] so that at a specific time, everyone would to go hard on the hashtag, and encouraged everyone to keep at it,\\" he told BBC Trending. The church burnings were by no means completely absent from the news prior to the Twitter storm - many news outlets, including Buzzfeed, the New York Times, and the BBC reported on the story before the action. But Masri says the real target of the campaign was American domestic television networks, and in particular, 24-hour news. \\"We're talking about CNN and Fox,\\" he says, \\"because not everyone's on social media.\\" Throughout American history, church burnings have been used by white supremacists to intimidate black communities. The tactic was common during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, and the BBC's Nick Bryant reports that it remained prevelent in the 1990s, so much so that President Clinton established a task force to investigate church fires. A common theme of the Twitter activists is that the burnings are acts of terror, although the FBI has not yet identified a motive for the alleged arsons, nor have they been labelled hate crimes by the authorities. \\"Media loves to report terrorism commited by brown ppl but not about domestic terrorism committed against brown ppl,\\" read one typical comment. \\"America is so worried about ISIS and terrorism,\\" Masri says, \\"but when domestic terrorism is going on throughout the US, the mainstream media turns a blind eye to it. What we did is force them to talk about it.\\" A Google News search about the fires returned more than 1,400 stories, up from just over 300 on Tuesday. Although news of a seventh church fire broke later Tuesday, and could explain the increase, Masri claimed that the Twitter action worked. \\"We do have a power base where we are able to relay stories to the world and force them to talk about stuff,\\" he says.

In New York City, a middle-aged black insurance salesman named Doyle Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who is attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to stay sober. On the same morning that Gipson drives to a hearing to try to regain custody of his children, a successful, white, young Wall Street attorney, Gavin Banek, is distracted while driving and collides his new Mercedes CLK320 with Gipson's older Toyota Corolla. Banek was in a rush to get to court to file a power of appointment document, which will prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. Gipson was also in a rush to get to a hearing to argue for joint custody of his sons with his estranged wife. Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a blank check, rather than exchanging insurance information, thereby disobeying the law. Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \\"do this right\\", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately. He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, \\"better luck next time\\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone.

Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","completion":"Based on the hint provided, it is more likely that Group B (nearsightedness) had more people who spent a lot of time working at the computer.

The review is brief and does not offer any specific insights into the app's functionality, user experience, or overall quality. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I will explore various factors that could contribute to the app recommendation, ranging from Not at all to Definitely. 1. Not at all: In this scenario, the app would have significant functional issues, a poor user interface, or extremely negative reviews from other users. The brief review does not provide enough details to determine if these issues are present, so we cannot confidently choose this option. 2. No: The app might have minor issues or be lacking some essential features that would make it difficult or unenjoyable to use. Again, we do not have enough information from the single-word review to rule this out as a possibility. 3. Maybe: If the app has mixed reviews, average features, or focuses on a niche market, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation would be appropriate. This means that the app might not be perfect for everyone, but it could still be useful or enjoyable for some users. Based on the limited information available, the \\"Maybe\\" option seems reasonable, as we cannot definitively determine the app's quality from the one-word review. 4. Yes: To recommend the app with a \\"Yes,\\" the app should have mostly positive reviews, a well-designed user interface, and useful or entertaining features. Unfortunately, the given review does not provide enough information to support a \\"Yes\\" recommendation confidently. 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation suggests that the app has exceptional quality, outstanding features, or a superb user experience. Such a recommendation would come from a thorough evaluation of the app or a collection of overwhelmingly positive reviews. As the given review does not provide any specifics, it is not sufficient to support a \\"Definitely\\" recommendation. In conclusion, based on the limited information of the review \\"Dine,\\" it is challenging to confidently recommend or advise against the app. Considering the lack of details, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation seems the most appropriate, as it neither thoroughly endorses nor condemns the app. However, it is suggested to seek out additional reviews and information about the app before making a final recommendation to a friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - A grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess. Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt). - The Congress of Vienna (German: \\"Wiener Kongress\\") was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium. The immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of MarchJuly 1815. The Congress's \\"Final Act\\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Eduard Heinrich Flottwell ( 23 July 1786 -- 28 May 1865 ; after 1861 von Flottwell ) was a Prussian Staatsminister . He served as Oberpräsident ( governor ) of the Grand Duchy of Posen ( from 1830 ) and of the Saxony ( from 1841 ) , Westphalia ( from 1846 ) and Brandenburg ( from 1850 ) Provinces . He was also Prussian Minister of Finance ( 1844 - 1846 ) and Minister of Interior ( 1858 - 1859 ) . Flottwell was born in Insterburg in the Province of East Prussia ( present - day Chernyakhovsk in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast ) , studied law at the University of Königsberg and entered the civil service at the Insterburg court in 1805 , from 1812 at the East Prussian Regierungspräsidium of Gumbinnen . After the Napoleonic Wars he together with Oberpräsident Theodor von Schön re-organised the administration of the West Prussian province at Danzig . In 1825 he was appointed Regierungspräsident of Marienwerder . When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Micha Gedeon Radziwi broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland , his brother Antoni Radziwi was dismissed as Duke - Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new Oberpräsident . He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies , which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region . In 1843 in \`\` Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem großen Hamburger Brand '' ( acknowledgment after the great Hamburg fire ) , he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg . - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - The Partitions of Poland were three partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth that took place towards the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of the sovereign Poland for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures. - The Grand Duchy of Posen was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, created from territories annexed by Prussia after the Partitions of Poland, and formally established following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Per agreements derived at the Congress of Vienna it was to have some autonomy. However in reality it was subordinated to Prussia and the proclaimed rights for Polish subjects were not fully implemented. The name was unofficially used afterward for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to refer to different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen. The Grand Duchy was formally replaced by the Province of Posen in the Prussian constitution of December 5, 1848.

Today a tipster tells us that the problem is not resolved — as of this morning, you could still find at least one full credit card number from a Blippy user on Google (shown below with the number obscured). Other searches reveal less sensitive data, like the last four digits of credit card numbers, the user’s bank name and dates and times of purchases. The question is whether Blippy’s users, already quite comfortable with sharing their credit card transactions with the world, will be at all unnerved by these recent data leaks.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: In Australian cricket what are 'extras' known as?","completion":"In Australian cricket, 'extras' are commonly known as 'sundries.' Extras, or sundries, refer to the runs scored by the batting side which are not attributed to the individual batsman's score. The term 'sundries' is more prevalent in Australian cricket, whereas 'extras' is the term used more commonly in other cricketing nations. There are different types of extras or sundries in cricket: 1. Wides: A wide is a delivery that is deemed by the umpire to be too far from the striker for them to hit it with a normal cricket shot. A wide ball results in an extra run being added to the batting side's score, as well as an additional ball in the over. 2. No balls: A no-ball occurs when the bowler's foot is over the popping crease at the time of delivery, the bowler throws the ball with an illegitimate delivery action, or when the ball bounces more than once before reaching the batsman. A no-ball results in one additional run to the batting side, and also allows the batsman an opportunity to score runs off that particular delivery without the risk of being dismissed, except for being run out. 3. Byes: Byes are extra runs obtained when the ball passes the batsman without making contact with the bat or the batsman's body (protective gear included), and the batsmen are able to take a run or runs. Byes are awarded if the wicketkeeper fails to cleanly take the ball and the batsmen manage to run between the wickets. 4. Leg byes: Leg byes occur when the ball makes contact with the batsman's body (excluding the hands), but not the bat, and the batsmen are able to take a run or runs. Leg byes are awarded if the umpire believes that the batsman made a genuine attempt to play the delivery with their bat. 5. Penalty runs: In some rare instances, penalty runs can be awarded to the batting side for various reasons, such as the fielding team deliberately obstructing the ball, the ball hitting a fielder's helmet left on the ground, or the bowler persistently running on the protected area of the pitch. These penalty runs contribute to the total but not to the individual batsman's score. Sundries or extras are essential components of the game as they can sometimes prove crucial in determining the outcome of a cricket match. The fielding side tries to minimize the number of extras conceded in order to restrict the batting side's overall score, while the batting side sees extras as additional opportunities to add runs to their tally without compromising their wickets."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Darren Feldman was given £20,000 compensation after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable. A Jewish surveyor received £20,000 in compensation today after a tribunal found that his bullying boss repeatedly taunted him and said he wanted to lock up and gas 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar’s son. Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.' A panel at Central London employment tribunal ruled that Mr Feldman, 33, was hounded out of his £47,500-a-year job with private hospital group HCA International. It found the firm and Mr Oates guilty of race and religious discrimination and harassment, ruling that Mr Feldman was constructively dismissed. Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end. 'I hope HCA takes action to make sure this never happens again.' HCA’s London hospitals also include. the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge, Harley Street Clinic, and Harley Street at University College Hospital. Mr. Feldman’s solicitor Shilpen Savani of law firm DWFM Beckman, said:. 'This is an extreme instance of an employer failing to safeguard an. employee. 'Mr Feldman should never have been subjected to such abuse.' Giving evidence, qualified surveyor Mr Feldman told how he joined HCA as a construction project manager in April last year. Colleagues soon learned that he was Jewish when he showed them a tattoo in Hebrew on his ankle. He told how director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is in his 40s and not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman (pictured above) alleged that on his boss's birthday,. the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar,. son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks. Mr. Feldman said: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run. down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing. ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive. reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to. have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. 'Chris. then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located. along King's Road called JuJu. He pointed his finger at me saying \\"want. to go to JuJu, Juju?\\" repeating it several times in an intimidating. manner.' 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.' In. his evidence, Mr Feldman said that on his boss's birthday the pair. discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of. Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar.

HCA and Mr Oates strenuously denied Mr Feldman's allegations. A. string of HCA witnesses including Mr Oates, who remains at the firm,. had also denied Mr Feldman’s allegations of racism but the tribunal. rejected their evidence. HCA said that it is 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment and considering an appeal. A. spokesperson said: 'HCA has a clear code of conduct around acceptable,. professional and ethical behaviour and offers an inclusive, open and. supportive working environment for all our staff.' In 2009, Spanish. electrician Juan Ignacio alleged that he was nicknamed ‘Manuel’ after. the Fawlty Towers waiter by workmates at HCA’s London Bridge Hospital. He. complained he was taunted with the famous ‘I know nothing’ and ‘Que?’ catchphrases used by Andrew Sachs’s iconic sitcom character. He. claimed that bullying bosses mocked his accent and jibed ‘He’s from. Barcelona’ in front of others - the standard excuse made for Manuel by. John Cleese’s Basil.

Write an article based on this summary: A pupil at a state boarding school was beaten when he refused to eat food he had just regurgitated, a court heard. Article:","completion":"Title: State Boarding School Pupil Endures Beating for Refusing to Eat Regurgitated Food Introduction In a recent court hearing, disturbing accounts emerged of a pupil at a state boarding school who was subjected to physical abuse when he refused to eat food he had just regurgitated. The case shines a light on the often hidden and unacknowledged problem of violence and abuse within the educational system, raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable students residing in boarding schools. As the investigation continues, it is crucial for all involved parties to address the systematic failings that allowed such an appalling incident to occur. Incident Details According to court records, the unidentified student fell victim to a brutal attack after he was unable to keep down the food served during a mealtime at the school. The pupil, who was suffering from an illness, involuntarily regurgitated the food and was subsequently beaten as punishment. When the young student attempted to seek help from the staff, his concerns were dismissed, and he was forced to endure this traumatic episode. The horrifying nature of the event has left many questioning the general safety and wellbeing of those attending state-aided boarding schools. While some argue that this is an isolated case, others contend that such incidents of violence are far from uncommon. Hidden Violence in Educational Institutions The case at hand is a horrifying reminder that violence can thrive in places where we least expect it to, like educational institutions designed to nurture and protect young minds. Despite the strict policies and regulations established to ensure a safe and secure environment, incidents of cruelty, abuse, and negligence continue to persist in those institutions that are entrusted with the care of vulnerable children. The problem of hidden violence in boarding schools and other educational institutions is no longer a secret whispers among students and staff members. Now that it has come to public attention, it is essential for the government to take substantive measures to implement strict regulations and devise strategies for addressing the root causes of violence, such as stress, fear, and a lack of empathy. Need for Systematic Change For the state boarding school pupil who suffered the devastating consequences of violence, the road to recovery may be a long and arduous one. But his story serves as an urgent call for immediate and far-reaching systemic change, especially in reforming policy and adopting measures to alleviate the toxic and violent cultures permeating many of our educational institutions. Without the necessary interventions, abuse and negligence will persist, depriving countless students of safe and secure environments where they can thrive, grow and ultimately achieve their potential. Conclusion As the case of the state boarding school pupil unfolds in court, it is vital for all stakeholders – the government, educational institutions, teachers, and parents – to join forces in eradicating the scourge of violence that has invaded our schools. By making necessary policy changes, enhancing regulatory enforcement, and fostering a culture of empathy and care, we can ensure that schools are prioritized as safe havens for students to excel academically, socially, and emotionally. And, most importantly, we must vigilantly safeguard the wellbeing of every pupil, so that no child ever has to face a harrowing ordeal like the one that this victim endured."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Convicted rapist Ched Evans will be offered a day job by his fiancee's millionaire father if his return to football is blocked, it emerged today. Last week the 25-year-old was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. But the decision sparked a huge backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill and presenter Charlie Webster, who quit as club patron. Evans was expected to start playing football again last Tuesday, but is yet to turn up. Scroll down for video. Support: The father of Natasha Massey,left, Ched Evans' fiancee, will offer him a job if his football comeback fails, it has emerged. Out and about: Evans took the rubbish out at home before going for a run as he again failed to go training with Sheffield United today. It has since been reported that the club may not offer the Welsh international a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. The millionaire father of Evans' fiancee Natasha Massey will offer him a role at his empire, which includes high-end jewellers and a staff rewards ­business, if his football comeback fails, the Mirror said. A source told the paper that Karl Massey said there would always be a job for Evans at one of his firms. They added: 'He believes 100 per cent in Ched's ­innocence, otherwise he wouldn't ­sanction him still dating his daughter or have given them his blessing to marry.' It has been reported that Mr Massey, 50, has paid for a PR campaign which protests Evans' innocence. He is also said to have hired lawyers to present new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review ­Commission in a bid to overturn his conviction. Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training. Twitter abuse was aimed at Olympic heptathlon champion and local hero Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people. She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans. 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received rape threats on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans is re-signed by the club. Last week the 25-year-old returned to training with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.' The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said. Ennis-Hill, a United fan, had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after she won gold at the London 2012 Olympics. Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. TV presenter Charlie Webster, Sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club since Evans returned to training. Wales international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train. Backlash: There has been huge support for a campaign to stop Evans returning to his former club, and other believe as he has only served half his five-year sentence a ban should last for at least that period. He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. South Yorkshire Police said on Friday: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Americans and Briton Who Thwarted Train Attack Receive Top French Honor Three Americans and a Briton received the Legion of Honor for disarming an attacker aboard a high-speed train headed to France. PARIS — President François Hollande of France on Monday awarded the Legion of Honor, France’s highest award, to three Americans and a Briton for their role in stopping a gunman on a high-speed train traveling to Paris from Amsterdam on Friday. The three Americans — Airman First Class Spencer Stone, 23; Alek Skarlatos, 22, a specialist in the Oregon National Guard; and their friend Anthony Sadler, 23 — received the honor in the gilded halls of the Élysée Palace, where they were joined by Chris Norman, 62, a British consultant. “One need only know that Ayoub El Khazzani was in possession of 300 rounds of ammunition and firearms to understand what we narrowly avoided, a tragedy, a massacre,” Mr. Hollande said at the ceremony, referring to the suspect in the attack, a Moroccan who is in police custody and denies that he had planned to stage a terrorist attack. “Your heroism must be an example for many and a source of inspiration,” Mr. Hollande added. “Faced with the evil of terrorism, there is a good, that of humanity. You are the incarnation of that.” After his speech, Mr. Hollande pinned the Legion of Honor medal on the three Americans, who wore khaki slacks and polo shirts, bringing a casual touch to the ornate ceremony. Airman Stone, whose thumb was severely cut by the gunman, still had his left arm in a sling as well as a bruised eye. The three friends were on a tour of Europe that included stops in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. They had intended to spend Friday night in Amsterdam but changed their minds and boarded a high-speed Thalys train to Paris. Shortly after the train crossed the Belgian border into France, they heard a shot, saw a gunman with an AK-47 and rushed to stop him. A French citizen who was the first to tackle Mr. Khazzani but who has declined to be identified will receive the honor at a later date, as will Mark Moogalian, 51, a passenger with dual French and American citizenship who struggled with the attacker and is recovering from a bullet wound. The courageous responses to the presence of a gunman drew attention and praise from around the world, especially in France, where many quickly encouraged Mr. Hollande to award the men the Legion of Honor, which was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 to reward “outstanding merit.” Several senior officials, including Prime Minister Manuel Valls and the head of the French rail company, attended the ceremony on Monday. Mr. Norman, speaking in French to reporters after the ceremony, said he felt honored by the distinction. “I did what I had to do,” he said. “It wasn’t heroism, it was what needed to be done in a situation of survival.” The three Americans did not speak publicly on Monday, but at a news conference on Sunday at the American ambassador’s residence, they brushed aside suggestions that they were heroes and framed their actions as having come from survival instincts. On Monday, the three grinned as they posed for photographs with Mr. Hollande and the American ambassador, Jane D. Hartley, on the steps of the Élysée Palace. After the ceremony, the three men and their families were expected to meet staff members at the United States Embassy, near the presidential palace. The upbeat mood will do little, however, to dispel growing unease in Europe about how to deal with new threats to targets like trains and how to monitor thousands of potential suspects, especially radical Islamist militants returning from Syria. “Faced with terrorism, our societies are not weak,” Mr. Hollande said at the ceremony. “And they will never be weak as long as they stay united, and as long as there are brave women and men ready to risk their lives.” While only French citizens can be members of the Order of the Legion of Honor, foreigners can receive the medal, which has also been awarded to the novelist Toni Morrison and the actor Clint Eastwood. Airman Stone, Mr. Skarlatos, Mr. Sadler and Mr. Norman were made knights of the order, the lowest of five ranks. Mr. Sadler was expected to return to the United States this week to begin his senior year at California State University, Sacramento. Airman Stone said on Sunday that he and Mr. Skarlatos would travel to Germany with their families and would receive further medical care there. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of ranks in the Order of the Legion of Honor. There are five, not four. Lilia Blaise and Elian Peltier contributed reporting.

The opening statement, \\"I have never seen such terrible performances in all my life,\\" is a strong introduction to the negative opinion of the review. It sets the tone for the rest of the comment by emphasizing the reviewer's disappointment with the performances by the cast. 2. The phrase \\"everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish\\" is a strong indication that the reviewer did not appreciate any of the performances in the movie. Using the word \\"rubbish\\" signifies that they believe the actors and actresses were of poor quality or below standard. 3. The reviewer mentions, \\"not one decent actor/actress in the whole film, it was a joke.\\" This statement highlights the reviewer's disbelief and dissatisfaction with the quality of the acting in the movie. The word \\"joke\\" suggests that the situation was so terrible that it could be considered laughable or absurd. 4. The comparison to \\"drama at school\\" hints at an unfavourable view of the movie's acting quality. Typically, school drama performances are considered amateurish or not as polished as professional productions. By making this comparison, the reviewer implies that the movie's acting was subpar or, at best, amateur. Altogether, these points converge to portray a highly negative impression of the movie in question. The reviewer uses strong language and comparisons to emphasize their disappointment and disapproval of the performances, ultimately giving off a negative perception of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on this information, one can confidently conclude that Greg Dyke was the managing director of LWT. London Weekend Television (LWT) was an ITV network franchise holder and a British television company, which provided broadcasting services for the London area during weekends from Friday evenings to Sunday nights. In this context, Greg Dyke, as the managing director of LWT, would have played an essential role in overseeing the company's operations and ensuring collaboration with important stakeholders, such as the representatives of the \\"big five\\" football clubs in England. The \\"big five\\" football clubs referred to in the sentence typically include Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur – all of which are highly respected and successful football clubs in England.

It now looks like Bruce Arena, the former US coach, most recently of LA Galaxy, will take over.

The problem is the US is not blessed with the same kind of players as that Germany squad - or any Germany squad. That's really where the downfall came. The way Klinsmann wanted to play, the players he had couldn't play that way.

At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989.

The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the three individuals who, in the original line-up, contributed to the band's lyrics? ? Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020.

Are the following two questions the same? What is an example of a symbol of respect? What does the symbol of a skull with a beret mean? What are examples of its usage?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. They are related to different concepts and require different explanations. Let me provide both in a detailed manner. Question 1: What is an example of a symbol of respect? A symbol of respect is any object, gesture, or representation that conveys admiration, reverence, or esteem for someone or something. These symbols can vary significantly across different cultures, religions, and communities. One example of a symbol of respect is a 'bow,' which is a traditional gesture practiced in various regions, including Japan, Korea, and China. In these Asian cultures, people bow to greet, express appreciation, or show respect for others, depending on the depth and duration of the bow. Another example would be the military salute. In armed forces worldwide, soldiers offer their salute as a mark of respect to their superiors, the flag, or during important events and ceremonies. The physical gesture of a salute typically involves raising the right hand, with the palm down, to the forehead or temple. There are also symbols of respect in religion. For instance, in Christianity, the Holy Cross represents Christ's sacrifice, and believers may genuflect or cross themselves in its presence to show their devotion and respect. These are just a few examples of respected symbols, but there are numerous others, varying from culture to culture or from one belief system to another. Question 2: What does the symbol of a skull with a beret mean? What are examples of its usage? The symbol of a skull wearing a beret is often associated with military or specialized units, particularly within the context of elite combat units or forces. The skull represents toughness and fearlessness in the face of danger, while the beret signifies the specialized, expert, or unconventional nature of the unit or group represented. Although the skull's usage with a beret may vary, depictions often highlight the group's exceptional skills, dedication, and determination. Here are two examples of its usage in military iconography: 1. The Green Berets: The United States Army Special Forces, also known as the Green Berets, have been often represented by a skull wearing a green beret. The Green Berets are an elite group of soldiers responsible for unconventional warfare and counter-insurgency operations worldwide. The skull in their symbol denotes their determination and courage, while the green beret points to their unique training and expertise. 2. Skull & Beret emblem in Airborne and Parachute units: Some parachute units and airborne forces worldwide employ the emblem of a skull with a beret, such as the Brazilian Army Paratroopers or Portuguese Army Commandos. The airborne units are specialized in air assault and infiltration operations and use the skull and beret symbol to signify their dedication and unique combat abilities. In non-military contexts, the symbol of a skull wearing a beret can also be found in some fraternity groups, biker clubs, or other organizations as a symbolic representation of camaraderie, inner strength, or resilience. In summary, these two questions are distinct and require separate answers. The first question asks for examples of symbols of respect, which include culturally-rooted gestures such as bows and salutes, or religious icons like the Holy Cross. The second question pertains to the meaning and usage of the skull and beret symbol, which is mostly associated with specialized and elite military units."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food - This step is necessary for the survival of the colony as they need food to sustain themselves and the larvae. 2. While gathering food, bees make wax - Bees need a place to store food and raise their young, and wax is the fundamental material for building and expanding their hive. 3. Bees make food called honey - Honey is made by bees as a stored food source for their colony. It serves as nourishment especially during periods when nectar- and pollen-rich flowers are not available. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Propolis is essential for the structural integrity and maintenance of the hive. It provides stability and protection from external threats such as weather and potential predators.

Dooyeweerd made several contributions to philosophy and other theoretical thought, including concerning: the nature of diversity and coherence in everyday experience, the transcendental conditions for theoretical thought, the relationship between religion and philosophy, and a different view of meaning, being, time and self. Dooyeweerd is most famous for his suite of fifteen aspects (or 'law-spheres'), which are distinct ways in which reality can be meaningful and good, and can exist and occur. This suite of aspects is finding application in practical analysis, research and teaching in such diverse fields as built environment, sustainability, agriculture, business, information systems and development.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Going grey<br>Lisa saw herself in the mirror. She couldn't believe it. She was going grey. Lisa thought she was far too young. She immediately shaved it off. Sentence: The reflection has grey hair.","completion":"Upon analyzing the provided text, it can be reasonably determined that the sentence, \\"The reflection has grey hair,\\" is true. Here is a more detailed answer explaining this determination: In the text, Lisa is looking at herself in the mirror. A mirror, by definition, forms an image of an object by reflecting light coming from the object. Therefore, when Lisa sees her reflection in the mirror, she is seeing an image of herself, composed of the light reflected off her. This mirrored image is presumably accurate, as there is no mention of any distortion or deceit in the text. As Lisa observes, \\"She was going grey.\\" This suggests that the actual Lisa, whose image is being reflected in the mirror, has grey hair. Consequently, since the mirror is accurately reflecting Lisa's appearance, her reflection should also contain the grey hair. Furthermore, Lisa's strong reaction to her changing hair color reinforces the conclusion that the reflection is accurately representing her current physical appearance. Lisa thinks she is \\"far too young\\" to have grey hair, which implies that seeing grey hair in her reflection is extremely surprising and possibly distressing for her. Consequently, it can be inferred that the presence and the visibility of grey hair in the reflection is what triggers her immediate decision to shave her hair off. In conclusion, since the text describes Lisa viewing her reflection in the mirror and reacting to the sight of her grey hair, it can be ascertained that the sentence, \\"The reflection has grey hair,\\" is indeed true. The reflection accurately portrays Lisa's current physical appearance, which includes her newfound grey hair, and supports her subsequent actions as a response to the realization of her changing appearance."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles. - Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite. - In cell biology, an organelle is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function. Individual organelles are usually separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers. - A taxis (plural taxes , from the Ancient Greek , meaning \\"arrangement\\") is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioral responses. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source. It is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - Saltern is a word with a number of differing (but interrelated) meanings. In English archaeology, a saltern is an area used for salt making, especially in the East Anglian fenlands. - Peripheral membrane proteins are membrane proteins that adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane with which they are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins. - Globular proteins or spheroproteins are spherical (\\"globe-like\\") proteins and are one of the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane proteins). Globular proteins are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins. There are multiple fold classes of globular proteins, since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape. - Phototrophs (\\"Gr\\": , = light, = nourishment) are the organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy. They use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic processes. It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic. Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats). All phototrophs either use electron transport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. Phototrophs can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs. - Sensory rhodopsin II ( SRII ) , also known as pharaonis phoborhodopsin ( ppR ) , is a membrane protein of archaea , responsible for generation of phototaxis signal . Sensory rhodopsin II is found in Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis - Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name \\"photosynthesis\\", from the Greek , \\"phs\\", \\"light\\", and , \\"synthesis\\", \\"putting together\\". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - An integral membrane protein (IMP) is a type of membrane protein that is permanently attached to the biological membrane. All transmembrane proteins are IMPs, but not all IMPs are transmembrane proteins. IMPs comprise a significant fraction of the proteins encoded in an organism's genome. Proteins that cross the membrane are surrounded by \\"annular\\" lipids (see annular lipid shell), which are defined as lipids that are in direct contact with a membrane protein. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents. - In modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. - A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things. Biological membranes, in the form of cell membranes, often consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions. Bulk lipid in membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high membrane fluidity environment of lipid bilayer with the presence of an annular lipid shell, consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral membrane proteins. The cellular membranes should not be confused with isolating tissues formed by layers of cells, such as mucous membranes and basement membranes. - Salt pork is salt-cured pork. It is prepared from one of three primal cuts: pork side, pork belly, or fatback. Depending on the cut, respectively, salt pork may be lean, streaky or entirely fatty. Made from the same cuts as bacon, salt pork resembles uncut slab bacon, but is considerably saltier and not bacon-cured or smoked. It is thus virtually identical to the Ukrainian food \\"salo\\", which also displays similar variation in meat-to-fat ratio. Long used as a shipboard ration, salt pork now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, or with greens as in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use. - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. - The lipid bilayer (or phospholipid bilayer) is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps. - In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. \\"nuclei\\"; from Latin or , meaning \\"kernel\\" or \\"seed\\") is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many. - Membrane proteins are proteins that interact with, or are part of, biological membranes. They include integral membrane proteins that are permanently anchored or part of the membrane and peripheral membrane proteins that are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. The integral membrane proteins are classified as transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane and integral monotopic proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane. Membrane proteins are a common type of proteins along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 2030% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins. - Halobacterium salinarum is an extremely halophilic marine Gram-negative obligate aerobic archaeon. Despite its name, this microorganism is not a bacterium, but rather a member of the domain Archaea. It is found in salted fish, hides, hypersaline lakes, and salterns. As these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles, their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic Archaea. \\"H. salinarum\\" has also been found in high-salt food such as salt pork, marine fish, and sausages. The ability of \\"H. salinarum\\" to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile.

Here is a goal: Make a cake in a mug Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Creating a mug cake is a quick and easy dessert solution that is especially ideal for one or two people, or when you're craving for a sweet treat but don't want to bake a full-sized cake. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make a cake in a mug. Requirements: 1. Mug: Ensure you select a mug that is microwave safe. It should be large enough to prevent the batter from overflowing during cooking. 2. Ingredients: Usually a mug cake requires common ingredients like: - All-purpose flour – 4 tablespoons - Sugar – 2 to 4 tablespoons - Baking powder – 1/8 teaspoon - Salt – a small pinch - Milk – 3 tablespoons - Butter – 2 tablespoons - Vanilla extract – 1/2 teaspoon - Chocolate chips (optional) – 2 tablespoons Ingredients can vary depending on the flavor of the cake you want. For instance, you would add cocoa if you are making a chocolate mug cake. Gather Your Ingredients 1. Start by gathering all the ingredients you need. This will save time and ensure you have everything ready before you start. Prepare The Batter 1. Melt your butter in the microwave. Do not over-melt it; heat just until it's turned from solid to liquid. Let it cool for a few seconds. 2. In your mug, add the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt) and mix well with a spoon. The baking powder will act as a leavening agent to help the cake rise. 3. Add the liquid ingredients (milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract) to your mixture in the mug. 4. Stir everything together until the mixture is smooth. Make sure the batter is free of lumps and the ingredients are well combined. 5. If you want, add your optional ingredients like chocolate chips or a dollop of Nutella, stir again. Cooking 1. Place your mug in the microwave. Set the timer to about 90 seconds on high. Microwaves may vary, so keep a close eye on your cake. 2. Let it cool for a minute or two as it will be very hot after being microwaved. Serving 1. You can eat the cake straight from the mug. If you like, garnish your mug cake with cream, a dusting of powdered sugar, or a spoonful of ice cream. 2. Remember, the mug will still be hot, so handle it carefully. Enjoy this quick and easy dessert! Please note that it's more cake-like than your standard pre-baked cake, but the benefit is that it can be ready in a matter of minutes with minimal cleanup. Plus, the convenience and novelty of having a personal cake in a mug make the process enjoyable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

John is most likely in Italy, given his desire to sneak out and get an authentic pizza. Italy is known as the birthplace of pizza, and it is home to some of the most renowned pizzerias in the world. The country boasts a rich culinary history, with a distinct focus on fresh ingredients, traditional recipes, and an unwavering dedication to quality. When people think of authentic pizza, Italy is usually the first place that comes to mind. In Italy, pizzas are traditionally thin-crusted and baked in wood-fired ovens, giving them a unique, smoky flavor that distinguishes them from other pizza variations found around the world. The country is also famous for its diverse range of regional pizza styles, from the Neapolitan margherita to the Roman pizza al taglio, rendering it a veritable pizza enthusiast's paradise. While John could theoretically find a decent slice of pizza in other countries or regions, nothing quite compares to the genuine article. Southern Europe does have its share of good pizza establishments, particularly in countries like Spain and Greece, but they are not on par with the Italian pizzerias. In Japan, Italian cuisine has become increasingly popular, and there are many pizzerias in major cities like Tokyo and Osaka. However, the Japanese take on pizza often incorporates unique twists, such as unconventional toppings or creative presentations, which may not satisfy someone craving an authentic Italian pizza experience. As for the ocean and rice paddies, neither of these locations offers much by way of pizza or culinary options in general. The ocean, being a vast body of water, provides minimal access to pizza, with the small exception of any potential pizzerias on cruise ships or in coastal areas. Similarly, the rice paddy, typically found in Asian countries like China, Vietnam, and Thailand, is primarily associated with the farming of rice, not the production or consumption of pizza. In summary, Italy is the most likely location for someone like John to seek out an authentic pizza experience. With its rich culinary heritage, diverse range of regional pizza styles, and passionate dedication to quality, Italy stands above the other options as the best place to satisfy one's pizza cravings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Each year you begin grazing it's best to start in a different pasture or paddock than the year before, and graze different paddocks from the year before, never keeping to the same schedule as last year's grazing season. This is so that you allow different pastures opportunity to get ahead or reach a different physiological state than they would if they were grazed at the same time year after year. It's perfectly fine to allow some paddocks to get ahead and reach flowering and/or seed set before either grazing, or mowing. Some of your pastures may have a variety of legumes that need to be allowed to set seed before next grazing, all to maintain a healthy stand. These range from clovers, sainfoin and cicer milkvetch to alfalfa, lespedeza and birds-foot trefoil. Depending on the grazing intensity and targeted utilization rate, you should look for things like how much is forage is left behind (basically height-wise, as well as leaf area) from what was there just before the animals were turned in, and ask yourself if you grazed too heavy or possibly too light. One important thing to remember is that it's very easy to allow animals to consume too much grass and not leave enough grass behind. So if you think you may have grazed too light, check plant height before and after to be sure with your grazing or yard stick. Basically, determining how much to leave behind is an art that requires a lot of observation, trial and error, and practice. There is no perfect one-size-fits-all way to judge how much to take versus how much to leave behind. This will help you determine how long your rest period may need to be. Your initial estimated rest period may be too short, or too long; it all depends on how slowly or quickly the plants recover from grazing.","completion":"The article discusses the importance of rotating grazing paddocks yearly, targeting ideal forage stages, and monitoring grazing intensity to maintain healthy pastures and optimize livestock grazing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question. What is divided into 114 suras?","completion":"The Quran, the holy book of Islam, is divided into 114 suras, also known as chapters. As the central religious text of Islam, the Quran is believed to be the word of God, which was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The Quran provides guidance to Muslims on various aspects of their life, including spirituality, ethics, morality, and the legal and social framework for the Islamic community. The Quran's 114 suras are not arranged in chronological order but are ordered based on their lengths, with the exception of the opening chapter, Al-Fatiha. Generally, the suras are organized from the longest to the shortest, although there are some exceptions. The suras encompass a diverse array of themes and topics, providing Muslims with insights and guidance on various aspects of their religion and life. Here is a brief overview of a few significant suras from the Quran: 1. Al-Fatiha (The Opening): As the introductory chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatiha consists of seven verses and serves as an essential prayer recited by Muslims in their daily prayers. The sura emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance and mercy from Allah. 2. Al-Baqarah (The Cow): The longest sura in the Quran, with 286 verses, Al-Baqarah revolves around a wide range of topics, including faith, laws, family matters, and guidance for building a righteous community. It also contains the story of the cow from which the chapter derives its name. 3. Ali 'Imran (The Family of Imran): This chapter has 200 verses and discusses numerous topics, including the importance of patience, faith, and trust in God. Additionally, it speaks of the spiritual connection between Muslims, Christians, and Jews, who share a common source of divine revelation. 4. An-Nisa' (The Women): As the title suggests, this sura, comprising 176 verses, primarily focuses on the rights and responsibilities of women in Islam. It includes guidance about marriage, inheritance, and the importance of treating women fairly and equitably. 5. Al-Kahf (The Cave): Containing 110 verses, Al-Kahf tells the story of a group of young men who sought refuge in a cave to protect their faith. The sura also highlights the importance of patience, the dangers of wealth and materialism, and the virtue of remaining steadfast in faith. 6. Ya-Sin (Yaseen): Often referred to as the \\"heart of the Quran,\\" this chapter contains 83 verses that emphasize the importance of worship, the reality of the afterlife, and the importance of the Quran as divine guidance. 7. Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful): This sura, consisting of 78 verses, highlights the bountiful blessings that God has bestowed upon His creation. It emphasizes the importance of gratitude and recognizing Allah's mercy in all aspects of life. These are just a few examples of the diverse and profound suras that make up the 114 chapters of the Quran. Each sura provides a wealth of guidance, lessons, and principles that are essential to the lives of Muslims and their practice of Islam. The Quran, as a complete book, serves not only as a guide to the moral and spiritual life of Muslims but also as a foundation for Islamic jurisprudence and theology."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Please answer the following question: - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process involves the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetized metal, leading to potential applications or phenomena that can be harnessed for practical use. There are several possibilities for this final step, depending on the specific context and objectives. 1. Electromagnet generation: The magnetized metal, now an electromagnet, can be utilized in multiple applications varying from simple to complex. Electromagnets are commonly used in everyday devices like speakers, headphones, and electromagnetic door locks. They are also crucial in more sophisticated equipment like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines and particle accelerators for scientific research. 2. Induction and energy transformation: The magnetic field created around the wire can interact with a secondary coil or wire bound to another metal. This interaction induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the secondary coil, thereby generating an electrical current through electromagnetic induction. This process is the backbone of transformers and electrical generators used to step up or step down voltage and convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, respectively. 3. Motor operation: The interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetized metal can be utilized to rotate a metal shaft, effectively converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. This principle forms the basis of electric motors used in various applications, from simple toys and household appliances to industrial machinery and electric vehicles. 4. Magnetic levitation (Maglev): The strong magnetic field generated through current-carrying conductors can be used to levitate objects, counteracting the force of gravity. Magnetic levitation technology has been applied in the field of transportation, where Maglev trains can achieve high speeds with minimal friction, leading to more efficient, fast, and smoother rides. 5. Data storage: The magnetization of the metal can be used for storing data in digital devices. In hard disk drives, small regions of the metallic disk are magnetized in specific patterns to represent binary data (1s and 0s). The data can then be read or rewritten by controlling the magnetic field applied to these regions. In conclusion, the last step of this process depends on how the generated magnetic field and magnetized metal interact, leading to various applications and phenomena. The specific application or phenomenon depends on the purpose of the system and the intended result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium. Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday. Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored a shock winner for Stoke in their 1-0 victory at Manchester City. Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day.

Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium. Promising youngster Tom Lawrence has arrived at Leicester from Manchester United on a permanent basis. Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1). Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws). Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side. Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash. The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013. Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4). The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League. Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15. Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football.","completion":"Here are the highlights for Stoke City vs Leicester City Premier League clash: 1.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations - because President Moon wants him to - because he said he would - not enough information Answer:","completion":"because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Although the Russo-German war was a battle between two totalitarian leaders (Hitler and Stalin), Beevor's writing style is biased in favour of the Soviets. Instead of relating the excesses of both sides, and placing the blame on both sides, Beevor is consistently trying to convince the reader that the Soviets are worthy of our sympathy. There are better descriptions of the battle at Stalingrad. Too bad this isnt one of them. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given review, it appears that the user would not recommend the product being reviewed. There are several reasons for this conclusion, all relating to the user's dissatisfaction with various aspects of the content and author's perspective. Firstly, the user criticizes the way the author portrays the Russo-German war, claiming that Beevor is biased in his representation of the conflict. The user specifically mentions that the writing style seems to favor the Soviets over the Germans, rather than attributing blame and excesses to both sides. This perceived bias is a significant cause for the user's negative impression of the product, as they believe that a more balanced approach would be necessary for a fair and accurate review. Secondly, the user seems to be disappointed with the way the author handles the description of the battle at Stalingrad. They mention that there are better accounts of this key historical event available elsewhere, and lament that the product they are reviewing is not one of them. This comparison to other sources suggests that the user is knowledgeable about the subject matter, further adding weight to their negative opinion. Overall, the user's dissatisfaction with both the author's perspective and their account of the events in the Russo-German war suggest that they would not recommend the product.
