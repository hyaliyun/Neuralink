Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Nabokov was a classical liberal, in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the Provisional Government following the February Revolution of 1917. Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian\\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \\"grey rag-tag people\\". Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism. Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister. That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish emigres who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times. When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: \\"There's nothing to look at. New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me. The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars. The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest. As to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood - well, I would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind.\\" Did he write about politics?","completion":"Yes, Vladimir Nabokov did write about politics. In the provided text, it is mentioned that \\"Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism.\\" So, Nabokov was engaged with political topics in his writings, particularly in expressing his opposition to various forms of authoritarianism and defending the rights of Jewish people."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

By Lillian Radulova and Aap Tony Abbott's government continues to languish behind the Labor Opposition, with the latest Newspoll showing the public would turf the government out in a landslide if an election was held today. The Newspoll, published in today's The Australian, shows that despite a tiny one per cent gain in the Coalition's primary vote in the last fortnight, Tony Abbott's government remains deeply unpopular with the electorate. The government's fortunes took a turn for the worst with the release of the May 13 Budget, which included cuts to welfare spending, schools and hospitals. When elected in September, the Coalition's primary vote was 45.6 per cent, but now it has fallen to just 36 per cent. Labor's primary vote in the September election was just 33.3 per cent, but has now risen under Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to 12.3 per cent. Newspoll also shows voters continue to prefer","completion":"Bill Shorten over Tony Abbott as the preferred Prime Minister. In order to analyze this article and draw insights, we can break it down step by step: Step 1: Identify the main points of the article - The latest Newspoll results indicate that Tony Abbott's government remains unpopular with the electorate. - The Coalition's primary vote has decreased since September, while Labor's has increased. - The May 13 Budget seems to be a major contributor to the government's decline in popularity. - Bill Shorten is currently more preferred as Prime Minister. Step 2: Analyze possible reasons for the current situation - The May 13 Budget contained controversial measures, including cuts to welfare spending, schools, and hospitals, which could have contributed to the decline in the Coalition's popularity. - The Labor Opposition, led by Bill Shorten, may be perceived as a better alternative by the general public. Step 3: Consider possible outcomes if the current situation continues - If the Coalition's decline in popularity continues and an election is held soon, the Labor Opposition could potentially win in a landslide victory. - The Coalition might need to reevaluate policy decisions and strategies if it seeks to regain electoral support. Step 4: Reflect on the potential impacts for both parties involved - For the Coalition, this could mean significant loss of power, potentially leading to policy changes or even leadership changes. - For the Labor Opposition, a win could provide them the opportunity to implement their agenda and gain political power in Australia. Step 5: Consider possible ways to address the issue for the current government - The Coalition could attempt to address the issues driving their decline in popularity, which likely includes the controversial budget decisions. - The government could also consider improving its communication strategy to create a more positive image and reconnect with the electorate."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Question: suppose more children become teenagers happens, how will it affect less adults have children. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: Less When more children become teenagers, it indicates an increase in the younger population reaching adolescence. This could lead to various factors that affect the decision of adults (including teenage adults) to have children. These factors could include: 1. Socioeconomic factors: With a larger teenager population, there might be increased competition for resources like education and job opportunities. This in turn could lead to more people delaying starting families due to financial constraints or prioritization of their careers. 2. Changes in attitudes and values: As more people enter into the adolescent phase, the likelihood of shifts in societal values and attitudes about family planning and parenthood may increase. This could result in more adults questioning the need to have children, further contributing to less adults having children. 3. Strain on public resources: With an ever-growing teenage population, essential services such as healthcare and education could become strained, making it difficult for prospective parents to access the resources necessary for having and raising children. However, it's important to note that different societies and countries will have varying responses to these challenges. Despite these factors potentially leading to fewer adults having children in the short term, long-term effects will depend on how these societies and individuals adapt and address the challenges presented by a larger adolescent population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds? Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, the town with more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds would be the one with Bob's bike repair shop.

This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Two counties paid a study about acid rain. They found out Hill county had experienced that, while New county hadn't. Which county experienced less air pollution? The answer to this question is:","completion":"New County experienced less air pollution. Since the study found that Hill County had experienced acid rain while New County had not, it can be concluded that New County had less air pollution that led to the formation of acid rain. Air pollution, specifically the release of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, contributes to the formation of acid rain. Therefore, the absence of acid rain in New County indicates reduced levels of these pollutants in the atmosphere, consequently suggesting that New County experienced lower air pollution levels compared to Hill County."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Differ on Taxes Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent — and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into “pass-through” business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details. For example, an executive who is paid 1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to “sell” 1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over 5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over 1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low long-term capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent. Current: For a married couple making between 18,551 and 75,300, the official marginal tax rate is 15 percent. But in practice, about 45 percent of American taxpayers pay no individual income tax (they do pay federal payroll taxes), because of various tax credits that particularly favor families with children. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to lower taxes across the board in line with a proposal earlier in the year by House Republicans, which reduced the 15 percent income tax bracket to 12 percent. The Tax Foundation estimated that plan would raise after-tax income for families in the 20th-to-40th percentiles by 0.5 percent, and for middle-income taxpayers by 0.2 percent. Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Americans in the bottom 95 percent of income would see little or no change to their taxes under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don’t pay federal income tax. Current: When a person dies, the first 5.45 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, 10.9 million for a married couple. Assets above those levels are generally taxed at 40 percent before being passed on to heirs. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to eliminate the estate tax, or the “death tax” as he and other Republicans refer to it, allowing even the wealthiest people to pass along their assets to heirs without being taxed. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She would lower the levels of exemptions to 3.5 million for individuals and 7 million for a couple. More families would have to pay, and very wealthy families would pay taxes on a higher portion of their assets. She would also increase the tax rate on affected estates to 45 percent. Current: It’s complicated. The official corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, higher than for most advanced countries. But the United States also offers a complex range of deductions that mean the effective rate — what is actually collected by the government — is much lower. If that combination of a high rate but low tax collections doesn’t sound very good, congratulations: Tax writers in both political parties agree with you. What Mr. Trump would do: He would sharply cut the top tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent. And he would apply that rate to partnerships and other types of businesses that currently pass their profits on to individuals who then are taxed at individual income rates as high as 39.6 percent. He would simultaneously eliminate a wide range of business deductions. With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home. The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by 1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation’s estimate. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She seeks a series of tweaks to the corporate tax code to try to dissuade companies from moving operations abroad to save on taxes. One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute “tax inversions,” in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner’s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an “exit tax” on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad. Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes. Current: The United States is on track to have a budget deficit of 534 billion in the current fiscal year and a total of 9.3 trillion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would gradually push the total debt relative to the economy to 86 percent from about 75 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He just overhauled his tax plan on Monday, and there aren’t detailed estimates available yet. But his earlier plan was estimated to reduce federal revenue by 9.5 trillion over the next decade. If not offset by either huge spending cuts or a major burst in economic growth, that would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, even before accounting for potentially higher interest rates as a result. His new proposal would probably reduce tax revenues by less than his original did, though exactly how much has not been fully modeled. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Her tax proposals are estimated to increase federal revenue by 1.1 trillion over the decade. She has said she would use that increased revenue to cover the cost of other policy proposals, with the intention of making her overall agenda have a neutral effect on the budget deficit. An earlier version of this article misstated an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the budget deficit over the coming decade. It’s 9.3 trillion, not 3.5 trillion. That would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, not 3.7 times larger. An earlier version of this article misstated the exemption threshold for the estate tax for a married couple. The first 10.9 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, not the first 12.9 million.

How to make a spiral cut hot dog Cook the hot dogs as desired. Usually boiling or steaming provides the best method to achieve a nice, sleek spiraled effect. Spear the hot dogs.","completion":"Take a wooden skewer and gently run it lengthwise through the center of the hot dog, ensuring it runs end to end for even cutting. Make sure to do this with caution and precision because it's vital for creating the perfect spiral cut hot dog. Now that your hot dog is firmly secured on the skewer, it's time for the creative part. Pick up a sharp knife and position it at an angle on one end of the hot dog. Once it's diagonally positioned, begin to cut into the hot dog as you turn it slowly. This is the start of creating the spiral effect. As you twirl the hot dog, slice it in a spiral way down its length, careful to not cut through to the skewer. The angle of your cuts and the thickness of the spirals are entirely under your control depending on how you want your spiral cut hot dog to look and feel. Work gradually to ensure the depth of the cuts are even and consistent all along the hot dog. Once the first cut is made, simply rotate the skewer and keep the knife stationary to carve your perfect spirals. The trick here is to keep your knife steady and let the turning of the skewer do all the work. The aim is to create uniform spirals that go around the hot dog evenly for the best cooking results. If the spirals are too thin or too deep, the hot dog may fall apart during cooking or won't provide the desired visual effect. Once you have rotated the hot dog all the way down, you'll witness your spiral masterpiece! But, you're not done yet. Gently stretch out the spiraled hot dog. This is to expand the cuts and to allow them to open slightly which will eventually optimize when cooking and give the frank a fun, whimsical aesthetic. With the hot dog spiral-cut and stretched out, inspect it to ensure there are no uneven pieces and the skewer is still intact. Make sure the spiral grooves are easily distinguishable because the grooves will not only make the hot dog cook evenly but also allow for sauces and toppings to nestle into the grooves for an explosive burst of flavors with each bite. Completion of this stage shows the successful execution of spiral cutting a hot dog. This process, while simple, requires attention to detail and careful movements. With practice, this technique of spiral cutting will allow you to create perfectly cooked, visually appealing, and flavorsome hot dogs which will be a hit at any barbeque or gathering! Now proceed with cooking as per your desired method and toppings. Enjoy your culinary creation!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The National Post reports Victoria Ambrose was found guilty of breaking a distracted-driving law, after a University of Guelph police officer whose vehicle was stopped next to hers at a red light in April says he noticed a \\"glow\\" in her car from an electronic device, per his testimony in front of Justice of the Peace Lloyd Phillipps.

Try to set a goal, such as building an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, saving for a major household purchase, or building a retirement fund. If your bank will let you, you can even give your account a nickname such as “Vacation Fund” to help remind you of what you’re working toward. A savings account is generally the easiest place to put your savings if you are just starting out. If you already have a solid emergency fund and have a reasonable amount to invest, such as 1,000, you may consider something like a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs make your money much harder to get to for a fixed period of time but tend to pay you a higher interest rate. Keeping your savings separate from your checking account will make it less likely that you'll spend your savings. Savings accounts also tend to pay a slightly higher interest rate than checking accounts. Many banks will allow you to set up an automatic transfer between your checking and savings accounts. Set up a monthly transfer from your checking to your savings, even if it’s just for a small amount. That's a relatively painless way to build your savings. If you get a raise, a bonus, a tax refund, or an unexpected windfall, put it in your savings or, if you have one, your retirement account. This is an easy way to help boost your account without compromising your current budget. If you get a raise, invest the difference between your budgeted salary and your new salary directly into your savings. Since you already have a plan to live off your old salary, you can use the new influx of cash to build your savings. If you work a side gig, build a budget based on your primary source of income, and dedicate your other earnings to your savings or retirement account. This will help grow your savings faster while making your budget more comfortable. Summary:","completion":"To save money effectively, start by setting a clear goal for your savings, such as an emergency fund or a specific purchase. Open a savings account separate from your checking account and consider giving it a nickname to remind you of its purpose. For those with larger amounts to invest, consider a certificate of deposit (CD) for a higher interest rate. Keep your savings separate from your checking account to avoid spending it and take advantage of automatic transfers between accounts to build your savings. Direct any raises, bonuses, tax refunds, or unexpected windfalls to your savings or retirement account to boost your balance without impacting your budget.

Article: Spending a lot of time watching TV, playing video games and surfing the Web causes a lot of healthy problems to children such as overweight and smoking, US researchers said yesterday. U.S. experts analyzed 173 studies on how media sources influence the physical health of children and adolescents . The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health. The studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \\"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\\" said one of the researchers in the report. For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside. One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens. A US study published in November showed that adolescents who watched more programs with sexual themes had a higher risk of becoming pregnant or causing a pregnancy. Thirteen of 14 studies that evaluated sexual behavior found a connection between media exposure and earlier sexual behavior, the researchers said. Question: How did the experts carry out their research? Answer: Choose from: (i). By examining health problems including overweight and smoking. (ii).

News article: Cholesterol screening recommended for 9-year-olds Children should all be tested for high cholesterol between ages 9 and 11 and again between 17 and 21 years of age, regardless of their family history, according to new guidelines released Friday. The updated recommendations, aimed at fighting cardiovascular disease before it starts, came in a report released by the National Institutes of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics. “The more we learn about heart disease and stroke in adults, the more we know that the process begins in childhood and progresses over time,” wrote Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, chairman of the panel that reviewed the guidelines. “By working with families, we can keep kids at a lower lifetime risk and prevent more serious problems in adulthood.” Previously, the AAP recommended only screening children who had a family history of high cholesterol and heart disease. To make the new recommendations simpler to implement, the panel also suggested that pediatricians could use a specific type of cholesterol screening test that does not require kids to fast before getting their blood drawn. In addition to updating cholesterol screening guidelines, the report also reinforces that children should be exclusively breast-fed through their first year of life, and recommends a diet low in saturated fat after one year. The new guidelines also encourage parents to protect their children from tobacco smoke, and encourages them to engage in physical activity - both contributing factors to heart disease later in life. “We’re aware that pediatricians have a long list of things they have to address as part of health promotion and disease prevention. This is really an important part of what should be on that list,” Daniels wrote. “We as pediatricians really need to get kids started on the right track and keep them in as low a risk category as possible.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article says that doctors recommend testing children for high cholesterol two times: once when they are between 9 and 11 years old, and again when they are between 17 and 21 years old.

You can make any dinner entree into a 3 course meal just by adding 2 more. So affordable! The pot pie crust was extremely flakey which is just the way I like it. The inside was hot and the vegetables and chicken seemed very fresh. I got coleslaw on the side which was great and bursting with flavor. I don't see why people are leaving bad reviews on here. You're getting great tasting food for a great price and a friendly and caring staff. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with a Bob Evans around but this may be my new favorite place for an affordable meal. A:","completion":"Step 1: Read the entire review carefully.

Given the question: Given the following passage \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\", answer the following question.

Osorio told her family she had given birth, after faking her pregnancy for nine months, and the baby was in hospital because of a medical problem. She befriended an unidentified 26-year-old mother and tried to suffocate and stab her in an attack to steal her child. Article:","completion":"Title: Gabriela Osorio Sentenced to 24 Years for Attempting to Steal Baby from New Mother Introduction: In a shocking turn of events, 30-year-old Gabriela Osorio was sentenced to 24 years in prison yesterday for attempting to steal a baby from a new mother by attacking her. The incident has left a lasting impact on the victim and her family, shedding light on the disturbing lengths people are willing to go for their own selfish reasons. Background of the Case: Gabriela Osorio had been faking her pregnancy for nine long months, deceiving her family and friends into believing that she was expecting a child. In an elaborate ruse, Osorio even informed her loved ones that the baby was in the hospital due to a medical problem, further convincing them of her fabricated pregnancy. The Attack on the New Mother: In her desperate bid to obtain a child and maintain her deceit, Osorio befriended an unidentified 26-year-old new mother. Through this friendship, she meticulously planned and carried out a heinous attack, attempting to suffocate and stab the young mother in order to steal her baby. Step 1: Establishing the connection with the mother: Osorio's first step was to get close to the new mother, gaining her trust and becoming a part of her life. By doing so, she ensured that she had access to the mother and the child, and an opportunity to carry out her plan. Step 2: Identifying the right moment: As the friendship grew, Osorio was eventually given the opportunity to visit the new mother at her home, where she would be isolated and vulnerable. This was the perfect moment for her to execute her heinous plan. Step 3: The attack on the mother: Taking advantage of the situation, Osorio proceeded to try and suffocate the new mother, rendering her unconscious, so she could take the baby without resistance. Failing to achieve this, she brandished a knife and attempted to stab the mother, an act that displayed the lengths she was willing to go to steal a child. The Aftermath and Sentencing: Fortunately, the new mother managed to fight off Osorio's attack, escaping with her baby unharmed. Osorio was apprehended by the authorities and brought to trial for her horrifying actions. The judge ruled that Gabriela Osorio's actions were a dangerous assault on the sanctity of motherhood and posed a significant threat to the safety of the new mother and her baby. In light of this, the judge believed a lengthy sentence of 24 years was an appropriate punishment to reflect the gravity of Osorio's actions and to serve as a deterrent to others considering such heinous acts. Conclusion: Gabriela Osorio's conviction is a harrowing reminder of the dangerous lengths people are willing to go to maintain a lie. This tragic case has sent shockwaves through the community, while also highlighting the importance of vigilance and support for new mothers and their vulnerable infants."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text of article and corresponding title of an article.

Private eye named Jake Masters is hired by eccentric millionaire Jason Dominic to clear up a phony murder rap. The NYPD is hunting for Dominic, in connection with the brutal murder of a cocktail waitress named Lucille Reynolds, and Dominic wants Masters to find the real killer. Masters is sent to La Guardia Airport to pick up Cora MerrillâDominic's trigger-happy troubleshooter. After an initial case of mistaken identity, Jake, his trainee nephew Keith and Miss Merrill head out to Dominic's palatial (but shabby) yacht. Dominic tells them the police believe he killed Lucille because she had filmed an orgy featuring him with three drug-addicted whores, who then blackmailed him out of 50,000. In search of suspects, Jake gets involved with a group of hookers including a bizarre act of necrophilia. Jake eventually stumbles onto the revelation that Cora Merrill has been leading him on â actually working for Jason Dominic to knock off the blackmailers after Jake has located them for her!

The nurse tried to store the medicines inside the cabinets but the","completion":"shelves were already cluttered with boxes, bottles, and fading labels. Frustration etched onto her face as she attempted to rearrange the items to make room for the new batch of medications. The tiny storage room had served the small town clinic for decades, but it had seen better days. The paint was peeling off the walls, and dust coated the window sills, adding to the general sense of disarray. The clinic was understaffed, and the nurses often had to multitask, covering the roles of both medical personnel and cleaners. As she struggled to find space, Sarah, the nurse, noticed an odd-looking package wrapped in aged, crinkled dark brown paper. It was tucked away in the back corner of the deepest shelf, covered in a thick layer of dust. Curiosity piqued, she carefully extricated the package from its hiding place. As she held it in her hands, she could feel how heavy and dense the object was, indicating that it was something significant. Carefully unwrapping the paper, she revealed an old wooden box, adorned with elaborate carvings and inlaid with shimmering stones. The carvings depicted various symbols and animals, as well as what seemed to be celestial bodies like stars and comets. The box appeared to be very old, but it was well preserved, devoid of any scratches or damage. Sarah's attention was drawn to the silver clasp that secured the box shut. Meticulously crafted into the clasp was an emblem depicting intertwined snakes, a symbol often associated with healing and medicine. Despite the strange and archaic nature of the box, her curiosity grew stronger, and she decided to open it. The clasp was stiff, resisting her initial attempts to pry it open, but eventually, it yielded, and she carefully lifted the lid. Inside the box, she found a collection of vials, each holding a different color liquid. They seemed to be medicinal potions, long forgotten and left behind by someone from another time. The colors of the liquids were unlike any medicine she had seen before, with vibrant shades of luminescent blue, fiery red, and glowing green. Accompanying the vials was a small, yellowed parchment, covered in neatly written script. Determined to understand the purpose of these mysterious potions, Sarah carefully retrieved the parchment, unfolding it to reveal a list of names, each followed by a unique set of instructions. Much to her surprise, some of the names were familiar to her - they were prominent figures from the town's rich history, dating back centuries. As she read through the instructions, it quickly became apparent that these potions were powerful remedies for ailments that modern medicine had failed to address. What's more, the list included ailments afflicting several of the town's current residents, who were otherwise facing bleak prognoses. A wave of excitement and a sense of newfound responsibility washed over Sarah as she realized that she had made an incredible discovery. With these ancient remedies at her disposal, she could help alleviate the suffering of her fellow townspeople and improve their quality of life. Word spread quickly about the miraculous healing that took place at the clinic. People from neighboring towns and cities began to flock to the small facility, and the once-neglected clinic soon found itself inundated with patients, all seeking relief from their previously untreatable conditions. The overwhelming response prompted the clinic to expand, employing more medical staff and opening its doors to new practitioners who were intrigued by Sarah's fascinating discoveries. Years went by, and the clinic evolved, growing into a renowned regional medical center, its reputation echoing across the land. The town, once struggling to survive, now thrived thanks to the influx of visitors and the prosperity the medical center brought to the area. At the heart of it all was Sarah, who continued to dedicate herself to the well-being of others and forever remained steadfastly focused on learning and harnessing the potential of the mysterious ancient potions. And so, a new chapter in the history of the town began as it emerged from obscurity and embraced its newfound destiny as a beacon of hope and healing, thanks to the selfless dedication of a nurse who had followed her heart and instincts, uncovering a secret that would change countless lives for the better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Halt the pumping process and incubate the microorganism culture (MOC) statically for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 37 °C and an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To provide a detailed and long explanation of the given statement, let's break down each component and understand the significance of this procedure in the context of microbial culture. 1. Stopping the Pumping: When working with liquid microbial cultures, aeration and agitation are crucial factors influencing the conditions for growth. This is usually achieved by continuous pumping or mixing to ensure the uniform distribution of nutrients, oxygen, and other vital components within the culture medium. In certain cases, it might be necessary to stop this process temporarily or switch to a static incubation. This could be done to allow the cells to adapt to any changes in conditions or to evaluate the effects of this change on the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms. 2. Incubating the MOC statically: Static incubation refers to a time period in which the culture is allowed to rest without any external agitation or mixing. The microorganisms are then expected to adapt and rely on simple diffusion, as no forced circulation of liquid or air is facilitated in the culture medium. This might be done to see how the cells respond to an environment without rigorous mixing or to promote particular growth patterns or metabolic activities in some microorganisms that might prefer static conditions. 3. Duration of incubation: The specified incubation period of 3.5 hours allows sufficient time for the microorganisms to adjust and respond to the altered growth conditions. Depending on the organism and its growth rate, this time frame might be adjusted according to the specific objectives of the experiment. 4. Temperature of incubation: The temperature of 37 °C is a common incubation temperature for many microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus that grow optimally at human body temperature (37 °C or 98.6 °F). Maintaining this specific temperature ensures that the microorganisms experience optimal growth conditions during the incubation period. 5. Atmosphere containing 5% CO2: CO2 is an essential component for microbial growth, as it provides carbon for the synthesis of cellular compounds and can also maintain the pH of the culture medium. The desired atmosphere containing 5% CO2 can be achieved by incubating the culture in a CO2 incubator, where the CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature are carefully maintained and controlled. This environment mimics the natural conditions inside certain host organisms, thereby promoting the growth and activity of some microorganisms. In summary, to follow the instruction provided, you need to stop the pumping process and incubate the MOC statically for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 37 °C and a CO2 concentration of 5%. This procedure is performed to study the response of the microorganisms under these specific conditions, potentially promoting different growth patterns, metabolic activities, or adaptation mechanisms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(2) I need to rest for a piece., does the word piece mean the same thing?","completion":"No, the word \\"piece\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In English, the word \\"piece\\" can have different meanings. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the different meanings of \\"piece\\" in each context. (1) It is not known who created this piece. In this sentence, the word \\"piece\\" refers to an object, artwork, or composition, such as a painting, sculpture, musical composition, or literary work. This usage implies that there is a creative work in question, and the creator or author of that work is unknown. (2) I need to rest for a piece. In this sentence, the word \\"piece\\" is likely a typo or possibly a regional colloquialism. The more standard and widely accepted word choice should be \\"while\\" instead of \\"piece.\\" In that case, the sentence would read as: \\"I need to rest for a while.\\" Here, the speaker is expressing a desire to take a break and rest for a short period. It is essential to note that this usage of \\"piece\\" is nonstandard, and it should not be used in formal writing or communication. However, if the word \\"piece\\" was intended, it seems out of context and does not have a clear meaning in this sentence. In summary, the word \\"piece\\" has different meanings in the two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a work of art or creative composition, while in the second sentence, it appears to be a nonstandard usage that, when replaced with \\"while,\\" conveys the meaning of taking a break for some time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pet the bearded dragon gently.\\"","completion":"Title: How to Safely and Gently Pet a Bearded Dragon Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about how to carefully and kindly pet a bearded dragon. Bearded dragons are cool, friendly lizards that many people have as pets. They are named bearded dragons because they have a beard-like part under their chin that can puff up and look like a beard. But before we learn how to pet a bearded dragon, there is something very important that we need to do first. Can you guess what that is? Yes, that's right! We need to wash our hands. Washing your hands is very important because it helps keep you and the bearded dragon healthy. Germs and dirt from our hands can make them sick, and we don't want that. So, always remember to wash your hands with soap and water before you touch your bearded dragon friend. Now that our hands are clean, let's learn how to approach the lizard. Step 1: Approach Slowly Bearded dragons are gentle creatures, but they can get scared if we move too fast or make loud noises. To make sure we don't frighten them, we need to approach them slowly and calmly. Walk up to the lizard very slowly, like a sloth, and do not make any loud noises. This helps the bearded dragon understand that we are not a threat and that we just want to be friends. Step 2: Touch Gently Once we are close enough to touch the bearded dragon without reaching or stretching, it's time to gently touch it. Slowly and softly place your hand on the lizard's back. Remember, always be very gentle – we don't want to scare or hurt our new friend! Step 3: Pet the Bearded Dragon Now that we have softly touched the bearded dragon, it's time to pet it. Using our clean hand, we will gently stroke the lizard's back, moving from its head to its tail. It is important to pet the bearded dragon in the same direction as its scales because that feels nicer for the lizard. And that's it! Now you know how to safely and gently pet a bearded dragon. Remember to always wash your hands, approach the lizard slowly and calmly, and pet its back gently. This will help you become friends with your bearded dragon and make them feel happy and loved. Happy petting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples:. 1. Captain Morgan. The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame. 2. Johnnie Walker. Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with \\"Old Highland Whisky,\\" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel. Jasper Newton \\"Jack\\" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel. 4. Jose Cuervo. In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam. Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of \\"Old Tub.\\" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ. 6. Tanqueray. When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari. Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.

Write an article using the following points: Joanne Dowling, of south Wales, got stuck in bin battle with neighbour, 58. After politely complaining, mother, 42, was hit by series of 'childish' pranks. Row came to head when Gary Jones dumped half-eaten cake in her bin. After she tossed it on his doorstep he burst into her home and attacked her. Father is banned from contacting Ms Dowling and her family for three years.","completion":"Title: \\"Neighbourly Dispute Escalates Into Bin Battle in South Wales\\" Introduction A seemingly innocent neighbourly disagreement over waste disposal in a South Wales community escalated into a full-blown feud between Joanne Dowling, a 42-year-old mother, and her 58-year-old neighbour, Gary Jones. The initial complaint spiralled into an exchange of childish pranks, culminating in a physical attack that resulted in a restraining order. The Onset of the Bin Battle: A Polite Complaint Joanne Dowling, a conscientious resident of South Wales, approached her neighbour Gary Jones after noticing that he consistently neglected to properly dispose of his rubbish. The 42-year-old mother politely addressed the issue, hoping that a respectful conversation would put an end to the problem. Unfortunately, her attempt at a reasonable resolution was met with hostility, as Jones reacted defensively to Dowling's complaint. A Childish Escalation: Tit-for-Tat Pranks Rather than taking Dowling's concerns on board and amending his waste disposal habits, Jones chose to retaliate by engaging in a series of childish pranks aimed at tormenting Dowling and her family. These immature tactics, driven by a desire for retaliation instead of fostering neighbourly harmony, only served to further inflame tensions between the once-cordial community members. Tensions Boil Over: A Half-Eaten Cake Dispute The bin battle between Dowling and Jones reached a boiling point when Jones disposed of a half-eaten cake in Dowling's bin. Rather than ignoring the clearly provocative move, Dowling responded by tossing the cake back on Jones' doorstep. This action prompted an enraged Jones to barge into Dowling's home, culminating in a physical altercation between the two previously civil neighbours. Restraining Order: A Judicial Intervention In light of the increasingly violent nature of the feud between Dowling and Jones, the court saw it fit to impose a three-year restraining order preventing Jones from contacting Dowling and her family in any manner. This legally enforced separation was deemed necessary in order to protect the well-being of Dowling and her loved ones, while simultaneously providing an opportunity for the community to heal. Conclusion: A Lesson in Neighbourly Relations The bin battle that unfolded between Joanne Dowling and Gary Jones in South Wales serves as a cautionary tale of how seemingly innocuous disputes can quickly escalate into dangerous situations when not handled with maturity and restraint. As neighbours, it is crucial to engage in open dialogue and seek peaceful resolutions to conflicts, fostering a harmonious living environment for all members of the community. In this particular case, had both parties treated the dispute with a level-headed approach, the outcome may have been far less severe, with the issue resolved amicably. Instead, the childish escalation led to lasting unrest, and ultimately, judicial intervention. Communities must learn from such incidents and work together to create a supportive, respectful environment in which conflicts can be addressed and resolved without resorting to malicious tactics, aggression, or violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Many people have talked about whether or not computing machines can think. Can they or can't they? Almost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks. Computers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _ If people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \\"teaching\\" the machine and telling the machine \\"yes\\" when the machine is right, and \\"no\\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better. But, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \\"think\\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \\"think\\". People, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944. It would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking. And to consider that machines can think gives people a big push to give to machines more and more work in thinking. Question: Which probably is the best title for the passage? Options: A: What Is Thinking? B: Can Machines Think? C: Can Machines Be Taught to Think? D: Can Machines Beat All Checkers Players? Answer:","completion":"B: Can Machines Think? Reasoning: The passage discusses the capabilities of computing machines in performing various tasks, the comparison between human thinking and machine performance, and the ongoing debate on whether machines can think.

The music video for \\"Closer\\" was directed by Mark Romanek and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.Critical response to The Downward Spiral has generally been favorable, and retrospective reviews regard it as one of the most important albums of the 1990s. It was included in several publications' best album lists: in 2005 the album was ranked 25th in Spin's list of the \\"100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005\\", and in 2003 Rolling Stone ranked the album number 200 on their \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list.

As the valet workers will be driving your car, it is respectful to tidy up and ensure that their experience driving your car is not a negative one. Remove any trash or leftover items of food at a gas station or service station before starting your trip. Although washing the exterior of your car is not necessary, do so if your car is extremely dirty. Valet parking is a classy service, so ensuring that your car is presentable will be a nice touch before entering the drop off zone. It is a nice touch to hang an air freshener in your car if you smoke or if you’ve eaten any food in the car recently. Tipping your valet is an important thing to do, as valet jobs are difficult and drivers are sometimes reliant on tips to complete their full minimum wage. Plan on spending 2 - 5 (USD) on tips when you drop off your car, and 2 to 5 dollars when you pick your car back up. Taking out ten dollars in cash and saving it specifically for tipping will keep you from not having any cash on hand when the time comes. Although a two to five-dollar tip is average, you can tip more if your valet was particularly professional and hard working. Before arriving at your destination, place your valuables in a bag, or take them out of your car before you leave for your destination. Although you should not assume that the valet will steal anything from you, there is no reason to risk theft by leaving something expensive in your car. Things like electronics, wallets, or sentimental items should all be removed prior to dropping your car off. If you have items that you are not particularly worried about, you can tuck them under the seats of your car. The prices for valet services could vary significantly depending on where you are dropping off your car. Some businesses will provide complimentary valet parking, but others will charge you. Checking beforehand will allow you to prepare for the expense. Ask if they take credit or debit cards, or if they only accept cash. If you are using valet services at a hotel, they will mostly like charge you a daily rate. When dropping your car off at the valet, there is a chance that your key could be lost. Although this is rare, it is not worth risking your entire key ring. Either bring a spare car key to give the valet worker, or take the key off the ring and bring the rest of your keys with you, keeping them safe and secure. Giving your entire key ring to the valet worker is also a pain for them, especially if you have an abundance of keys on your ring.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of courtesy and etiquette when using a valet service for your car. It highlights several steps to ensure a positive experience for both the car owner and the valet worker, such as tidying up the car's interior, removing trash and leftovers, and cleaning the car's exterior if it is extremely dirty. Additional suggestions include using an air freshener for unwanted smells and tipping the valet worker generously (2-5 USD for both drop-off and pick-up). To avoid any issues with lost keys or theft, car owners should also remove any valuables from their vehicle and separate their car key from other keys on the keyring. It is also advised to inquire about the costs of valet services beforehand, as they can vary significantly depending on the location and type of establishment. Some places may offer complimentary valet parking, while others may charge a fee. It is crucial to check if the valet service accepts credit or debit cards, or if it requires cash payment. In the case of hotel valet services, a daily rate is the most likely pricing structure. Finally, the article advises being prepared for the unlikely event of your car key being lost by the valet service. To minimize potential issues, bring a spare key or detach the car key from the main keyring, enabling you to keep hold of your other important keys and making the valet worker's job easier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The electrons in the small sign are less energized than the electrons in the large sign because the small sign is not lighting up. When a neon sign is functioning properly, electrons within the gas-filled tubes become energized when the applied voltage is sufficient to excite them. These electrons then collide with the gas, typically a mixture of neon and other gases, causing the gas atoms to emit photons, which create the visible light we see in a functioning neon sign. In this case, since the small sign is not lighting up even though it is plugged in, it is possible that the amount of voltage or current being supplied to the small sign is insufficient to energize the electrons, or the sign could be defective. The large sign, on the other hand, is working as expected and is lighting up, indicating its electrons are being energized appropriately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger. While she was young, Mo read to her from Inkheart, inadvertently freeing Dustfinger as a result, due to a gift he possessed from birth, that marks him as a \\"Silver Tongue\\". Unfortunately, his gift also freed the book's villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and several of his henchman, but at the same time, losing Resa after being forced to flee with his infant daughter.

The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi. and a hint : Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Please answer this question : Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","completion":"The Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content. In the given hint, it is mentioned that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. This is because, under these conditions, plants have less need to invest carbon in their symbiotic relationship with AM fungi as they can access nutrients more easily. As a result, the plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and the fungi, in turn, reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Over time, these environmental conditions can create local adaptations among plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations. Considering this information, we can infer that the Southern parcel, which has almost no traces of AM fungi, experienced higher nutrient and moisture concentrations. This resulted in a decreased reliance on AM fungi by the plants in the Southern parcel, leading to a less diverse and less prevalent AM fungal community. In contrast, the Northern parcel had a higher presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating that the soil nutrient concentrations were likely lower, and the plants relied more heavily on their association with AM fungi to obtain nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tango Answer:","completion":"Title: The Dance of Deceit Genre: Crime Thriller / Action Plot: In the bustling city of Rio de Janeiro, a high-stakes game of corruption and betrayal is set against the vibrant backdrop of the local tango scene. Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Roberts, a retired police detective, now works as a private investigator trying to escape his tumultuous past. Living in the heart of Rio's tango district, he is often seen at the local dance club, El Fuego, where he enjoys a quiet Tango dance. Our story begins as Tommy receives an intriguing case from his past acquaintance, Maria Sanchez. Maria, a captivating and skilled Tango dancer, contacts Tommy to reveal her suspicion that her estranged brother, Gabriel, has gotten involved with a dangerous criminal organization. Maria fears for Gabriel's life and pleads with Tommy to help her gather information about this organization. Against better judgment, Tommy takes the case, only to discover that the syndicate is far more powerful and vicious than he initially thought. Leading the criminal organization is a ruthless and enigmatic individual, Tango, whose identity remains a mystery to both Maria and Tommy. As the confident and inquisitive Tommy Roberts delves deeper into the case, he faces increasingly perilous encounters that put his life in danger. Simultaneously, the chemistry between Tommy and Maria begins to evolve into a passionate romance fueled by the intensity and seduction of Tango. On one fateful night, following a series of intricate dance events that mirror the twists and turns of their investigation, Tommy is cornered in a dimly lit back alley by Tango's henchmen. Just as hope seems to vanish, a shadowy figure appears and offers Tommy a bribe to drop the case and forget what he has learned about the criminal organization. Shockingly, Tommy recognizes the voice as Tango's. Bribery and corruption are cardinal sins in Tommy's book, and he infuriates Tango by refusing the offer and boldly confronting him. As they exchange fiery threats, the tension in the air is palpable. Suddenly, Tango reveals his true identity - Gabriel, Maria's brother. Feeling betrayed and bewildered, Tommy confronts Maria about the truth. Maria, torn between love for Tommy and her loyalty to her brother, confesses that she had been acting under Gabriel's orders to cover their illicit activities. But now, she is falling for Tommy, and her heart is overcome by guilt and confusion. Meanwhile, Tommy struggles as he is forced to decide between the woman he loves and the principles he swore to adhere to as a law enforcer. As the story reaches its climax, Tommy communicates crucial information to the local police about Gabriel's organization without Maria's knowledge. A highly-charged dance competition takes place at El Fuego, where Maria and Tommy, alongside Gabriel and his associates, participate. The tension between them builds to a fever pitch as they dance – secrets and deception playing out in every step, each partner locked in a clash of intense determination. As the dance comes to an end, the entire club is raided by the police, led by Tommy's former partner and friend, Sergio. The shock of the police raid on Gabriel's organization stuns Maria, while Tommy watches on, his face etched with a mix of relief and sadness. In the aftermath, Gabriel is apprehended and the criminal organization dismantled, but Tommy and Maria's relationship is beyond repair. Knowing the consequences of his duty, and believing he did what was right, Tommy watches as Maria tearfully turns away, both of them knowing that the dance of deceit has changed their lives forever. The Dance of Deceit is a tale of passion, betrayal, and moral dilemmas, where the seductive world of Tango encapsulates an intricate web of lies, loyalties, and ultimately, the price one must pay for truth and justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But now as a performance coach, he has found himself in demand once again at SW19 - as a 'hitter'. He has been helping the likes of world No 4 Novak Djokovic and women's quarter-finalist Garbine Muguruza in their pre-match preparations. A coach at the prestigious Millfield School in Somerset, the 27-year-old from Flintshire has taken annual leave to volunteer at the tennis tournament as a hitter for the second year in a row. He has to take what the world's best players can throw at him as they hone their killer shots. \\"A few of the players, they prefer to have a hitter than someone else doing a match warm-up, if that makes sense,\\" he explained from the home of lawn tennis. \\"They can be a little bit more specific with what they do, and almost use me in terms of put me in one corner, or work on something a little more specifically.\\" As a hitter, you are not expected to return every serve - in fact - for some, that just will not happen. \\"Watching (Rafael) Nadal with a hitter is quite funny, because the hitter probably hits one shot, and then Nadal hits a winner past them - but that's how he'll warm up. \\"What you notice is that everyone is completely different. Sometimes it is superstition to have the same hit, the same hitter, even the same court now.\\" In the first week of Wimbledon, James was out on the courts with both Djokovic and Murguruza - who cost Angelique Kerber her top world ranking spot with a win on Monday. \\"I remember getting a phone call... you've got an hour-and-a-half with Novak. I was pretty scared at the start. An hour-and-a-half alone is quite tough in this weather, and then you've got Novak and [coach Andre] Agassi watching you. \\"Quite a surreal moment - but probably one of my most enjoyable ones, out of all of them.\\" And when a hitter hits it off with his player? There are perks. Take Muguruza for example. \\"I don't know if it was superstition or that - but she is the one I've hit with from day one and kept going. \\"It's got to the point now that I'm into the player's box with her, and getting to watch her play, and that's almost a big bonus of what I do. I can practise with someone and actually get a little bit involved with the team.\\" As a junior player, the former Ysgol Maes Garmon pupil from Mold worked his way into the ranks of the world top 100 young players and turned professional. He did make it to a couple of junior matches at SW19 when he was 16 and 17 - but injury meant never as a senior. So now it is the coaching that spurs him on - and why he enjoys being a hitter almost as much as being a player. \\"It's perfect, because I can ask more questions and see what they do, off court a little bit as well,\\" he added. \\"So being able to come here in some capacity is the next best thing, and it's been a really good week.\\" Summary:","completion":"A former professional tennis player who had to quit the sport due to hip operations has found a new role as a performance coach and a 'hitter' at Wimbledon.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. I am facing a new situation today: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article, circadian rhythms are influenced by the amount of light entering the eyes, which helps control the biological clock. This biological clock is responsible for sending signals to the body, causing regular changes in behavior and body processes, including sleep and eating patterns. In the new situation, Jason is an average guy who experiences a natural day-night cycle, which provides consistent exposure to light and darkness. This allows his biological clock to function properly, guiding eating, sleeping, and other behaviors on a regular 24-hour cycle. On the other hand, Brad has chosen to live in a dark cave with minimal exposure to natural light. This environment disrupts his exposure to the day-night cycle, which could significantly impact the regulation of his biological clock. Without a stable light-dark cycle, Brad's circadian rhythms are more likely to be disrupted, potentially leading to irregular patterns of eating, sleeping, and other activities. Therefore, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day, as his biological clock is functioning optimally due to his regular exposure to a natural light-dark cycle. In contrast, Brad's irregular exposure to light in his cave can lead to a disrupted biological clock, making it less likely for him to have consistent meal times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(B). No. While the statement provided offers some contextual information about Liberia's account deficit, it lacks a clear and direct answer to the question. An improved and detailed response is as follows: Liberia has been facing economic challenges due to various factors, including a history of political instability, civil wars, and a reliance on foreign aid. Following the end of the civil war in 2003, the country experienced an influx of foreign aid and investment, which played a significant role in rebuilding its economy. However, as a result, Liberia has consistently maintained a large current account deficit, with the percentage peaking in 2008. The current account deficit of Liberia reached its peak in 2008 at approximately 60% of the country's GDP. This figure was primarily driven by a surge in imports – largely consisting of machinery, transportation equipment, and fuel – necessary for post-war reconstruction, and the impact of global food and energy price increases that year. On the other hand, exports in sectors such as rubber, iron ore, and various agricultural products could not keep up with the growth in imports, creating a significant imbalance. The 60% account deficit in 2008 can be attributed to an over-dependence on foreign aid and investment, which created a temporary boost in the economy without fostering self-sustaining growth. Furthermore, the heavy reliance on aid led to inefficiencies, misallocation of resources, and corruption in Liberia's economic system, leaving the country vulnerable to fluctuations in international markets and assistance. To attain sustainable economic growth and reduce the current account deficit, Liberia needs to focus on diversifying its economy, strengthening domestic industries and exports, improving governance and transparency, and developing infrastructure. While foreign aid is essential for the country's recovery, it must be utilized wisely and strategically, with a long-term vision of ensuring economic resilience and self-reliance for Liberia in the future. In conclusion, Liberia's account deficit peaked at nearly 60% in 2008, significantly influenced by an influx of foreign aid and investment following the end of the war. The country must take essential steps toward economic diversification, governance improvement, and further development to achieve long-term economic stability and reduce its reliance on external assistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Czech","completion":"Nyní se mu však poprvé podařilo zeptat se Dom, starověký z Gaie. Ačkoli původní otázka nebyla uvedena, mohu pokračovat v popisu scénáře a povahy Dom a Gaia v českém jazyce pro lepší pochopení kontextu. Dom je prastarý obyvatel planety Gaia, která je součástí Isaac Asimovovy série románů o Nadací. Gaia se odlišuje od jiných planet tím, že je celá spojena do jednoho živého organismu skládajícího se z lidí, zvířat, rostlin a i nerostů. Tato planeta je telepaticky propojená a její obyvatelé sdílejí své myšlenky a zkušenosti s ostatními členy Gaii, což vytváří jakýsi kolektivní vědomí a harmonii v celé společnosti. Dom představuje starověký aspekt gaitské společnosti, jelikož je jednou z nejstarších bytostí na planetě. Svou moudrostí a zkušenostmi získanými během mnoha staletí je pro ostatní obyvatele Gaie zdrojem poznání a inspirace. Ve zmíněné scéně se hlavní postava románové série, Golan Trevize, obrací na Doma s klíčovou otázkou týkající se funkce a účelu Gaie. Jelikož již byl pokus o položení otázky několikrát učiněn, tento okamžik představuje důležitý bod v ději románu. Diskuze s Domem odhaluje hluboké principy a motivace stojící za existencí Gaie. Dom vysvětluje, že Gaia slouží jako záchranný prostředek pro galaxii; jejím hlavním cílem je přinést mír a stabilitu na věčně bojující a konkurenční planety, které tvoří galaktickou civilizaci.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. China's Recent Trade Statistics Have Been Artificially Inflated Until now, Beijing’s monthly import and export numbers have been considered absolutely reliable, yet there is growing evidence to suggest that in recent months they have been distorted by fabricated transactions. Especially suspect are the export figures for this September and October. China’s exports for September soared 9.9% year-on-year. In the following month, they jumped 11.6%. For many observers, the September number signaled the beginning of the long-awaited recovery of the Chinese economy. The September-October period is now beginning to look like an anomaly from the baseline, represented by the more-typical August and November figures. In fact, the numbers for August and November look remarkably similar. In August, exports increased 2.7%. In November, they were up 2.9%. Imports, always a key sign of growth, fell 2.6% in August. In November, they were unchanged. Are we to believe China had an export boom lasting just two months? Anything is possible, but a more likely explanation for the anomalous September and October figures is that they were distorted by fictitious transactions. Anne Stevenson-Yang of J Capital Research in Beijing, in one of her November e-mail alerts, suggests that the uptick in exports may have been partly due to hot-money inflows caused by currency speculation. Exporters, she notes, are overstating sales, allowing them to book revenues in dollars. They then use the paperwork to get permission to sell dollars for renminbi. The result is that exporters made money with their currency transactions, but the byproduct is that the Ministry of Commerce’s trade figures overstate China’s exports. Tom Holland of the South China Morning Post reports an even more ingenious scheme that has artificially pushed up Beijing’s trade statistics. There is, he notes, legitimate trade where goods go from one part of China to another through Hong Kong. For example, it makes sense to transport through Hong Kong components manufactured in Shanghai for final assembly in Shenzhen. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been part of the People’s Republic, but it is not considered as such for customs purposes. Most of this China-Hong Kong-China trade has been routed through Hong Kong “as a tax dodge.” The benefits are substantial. For instance, China’s rules provide for a value-added-tax rebate of 17% on electronic goods. Moreover, under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between China and Hong Kong, no Chinese tariffs are imposed on goods exported to Mainland China if some value was added in Hong Kong. “All that’s needed then is a little imaginative invoicing, and you’ve got one very lucrative tax evasion scam,” Holland writes. “In all probability the goods never actually need to leave the mainland.” Holland believes the value of renminbi transactions associated with this tax stratagem over the past 12 months “may have been well over 1 trillion yuan.” In any event, these fake trades appear to be larger in volume than legitimate speculative trades involving the renminbi, and a well-known European journalist has recently stated that the round-tripped tax dodge trades were “material.” Hong Kong officials, he noted, have passed on information on faked trades to Beijing, which “so far has sat on its hands.” Why would Hong Kong’s officials not crack down on these transactions on their own? One reason is that they appear to be under orders to promote Hong Kong as the place to trade renminbi and these deals inflate statistics on renminbi usage there. Holland notes that all the fake trades are probably conducted in China’s currency to avoid the expense of forex dealings. Furthermore, Beijing gets a twofer: the fake transactions swell China’s import and export numbers and they artificially enlarge the statistics showing trade settlement in renminbi, something Chinese officials want to promote. Tom Holland’s fascinating reporting would not explain the September-October bump in exports, but he does show that these tax-dodge transactions have generally bloated Beijing’s trade numbers. And how long have these transactions padded China’s trade statistics? The fake transactions probably go back to 2010 because importers and exporters began to use the renminbi for trade settlement purposes in 2009.

Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss. HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years. In 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV is believed to have originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention... - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, this results in herd immunity. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five preventable infections. - Miliary tuberculosis ( also known as \`\` disseminated tuberculosis '' , \`\` tuberculosis cutis acuta generalisata '' , and \`\` Tuberculosis cutis disseminata '' ) is a form of tuberculosis that is characterized by a wide dissemination into the human body and by the tiny size of the lesions ( 1 -- 5 mm ) . Its name comes from a distinctive pattern seen on a chest radiograph of many tiny spots distributed throughout the lung fields with the appearance similar to millet seeds -- thus the term \`\` miliary '' tuberculosis . Miliary TB may infect any number of organs , including the lungs , liver , and spleen . Miliary tuberculosis is present in about 2 % of all reported cases of tuberculosis and accounts for up to 20 % of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases . - Sputum is mucus and is the name used for the coughed-up material (phlegm) from the lower airways (trachea and bronchi). This process is known as sputilization. In medicine, sputum samples are usually used for naked eye exam, microbiological investigations of respiratory infections and cytological investigations of respiratory systems. It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from the interior of the nose. Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot, or a white sink surface. The more intense the yellow color, the more likely it is a bacterial infection (bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia). - A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \\"wild\\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).

Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

Mr. Radcliffe will be doing the full monty in the revival of Peter Shaffer’s “Equus” (also starring Richard Griffiths and set to open on Sept. 25 at the Broadhurst Theater), a psychological melodrama with a certain literary heft.

She is joined in “The Seagull” (to open on Oct. 1 at the Walter Kerr) by Peter Sarsgaard, who in recent years has been cutting a cinematic swath with movies that include “Boys Don’t Cry” and “Kinsey.” The first time I saw him, though, was way off Broadway 12 years ago, when he was giving a blissfully funny performance as a male variation on Blanche du Bois in the Drama Department’s brilliant deconstruction of Tennessee Williams’s “Kingdom of Earth.” I am not nervous about the first Broadway outings of Ms. Scott Thomas, Mr. Sarsgaard or, for that matter, Jeremy Piven, who will be appearing as a foulmouthed studio executive in a revival of David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow” (to open on Oct. 23 at the Ethel Barrymore). Mr. Piven has of course had several years of practice impersonating a dirty-talking Hollywood power player as the slimy über-agent in the HBO series “Entourage.” But he also showed sturdy stage legs when he appeared Off Broadway in 2004 in Neil LaBute’s “Fat Pig.” No, the Hollywood celebrity I’m really worried about is that big green lug named Shrek, the popular animated movie hero who will be trying to effect the transition from two to three dimensions (and from speech to song) when he appears in the eponymously titled musical scheduled to open on Dec. 14 at the Broadway Theater. Mr. Shrek (who will be channeled by the fine flesh-and-blood actor Brian d’Arcy James) is famous for his crudeness, haplessness and general gracelessness.

The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal. This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax. He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, is facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus.

Determine the sentiment: After \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" redefined science fiction, and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" redefined \\"Star Wars\\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \\"A New Hope\\" and the more sinnister tone of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \\"Return of the Jedi\\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.","completion":"The sentiment of this text is positive.

Background: Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. Context: LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\" LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle. Question: Was there any controversies on Anti-doping?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, there have been controversies surrounding anti-doping, with Greg LeMond being at the center of some of these controversies due to his vocal opposition to performance-enhancing drug use in cycling. LeMond's outspokenness on the issue has led him into conflicts with fellow cyclists, including Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis, as well as the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) leadership such as former president Pat McQuaid. Key controversies surrounding anti-doping include: 1. LeMond's public criticism of Lance Armstrong's relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari in 2001, which fueled doubts about the legitimacy of Armstrong's Tour de France victories. This ultimately led to Armstrong being stripped of his titles and banned from professional cycling after being found guilty of systematic doping. 2. LeMond's criticism of Floyd Landis, who was also stripped of his 2006 Tour de France victory due to doping. 3. LeMond's call for a change in UCI leadership to address the issue of doping in cycling, which was met with resistance from Pat McQuaid. LeMond later supported Brian Cookson, who defeated McQuaid in the UCI presidential election in 2013. These controversies highlight the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding anti-doping efforts in professional sports, particularly in cycling. LeMond's dedication to anti-doping advocacy has contributed to raising awareness and fostering change in the fight against performance-enhancing drug use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the company whose chairman in 1962 became Lionel Hooke? is inside the article: The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25. Near the end of his life Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party, was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile.

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic.

Use the following highlights to write an article: New iPhone \\"kill switch\\" targets crime known as \\"Apple picking\\" Tool is part of new operating system for the iPhone. It requires a password to deactivate \\"Find My Phone\\" or wipe data. Mobile device theft a growing concern for law enforcement.","completion":"Title: The New iPhone \\"Kill Switch\\": A Game Changer for Mobile Device Security Introduction: In recent years, mobile device theft, specifically known as \\"Apple picking,\\" has been a growing concern for law enforcement worldwide. To address this issue, Apple has introduced a new security feature, dubbed the \\"kill switch,\\" which is integrated into the latest iPhone operating system. This technological innovation aims to deter criminals from stealing iPhones by adding a password layer to critical device functions such as deactivating the \\"Find My Phone\\" feature or wiping data from the device. Step 1: Detailing the \\"Apple Picking\\" Phenomenon To better understand the need for the iPhone \\"kill switch,\\" it's important to shed light on the widespread crime of \\"Apple picking.\\" This term refers to the theft and subsequent illegal sale of iPhones that exploits the value and desirability of these devices in the market. A discussion about the extent of the problem and the various ways thieves have managed to bypass security precautions will provide context for the significance of the new \\"kill switch\\" feature. Step 2: Describing the \\"Kill Switch\\" Feature The main component of the article will focus on explaining the new \\"kill switch\\" tool in detail. This includes describing how it works, the added layer of security it provides, and its integration into the updated iPhone operating system. By highlighting the new password requirement to deactivate key features such as \\"Find My Phone\\" or to erase data, the article will illustrate how the \\"kill switch\\" makes it more difficult for criminals to render a stolen iPhone untraceable. Step 3: Law Enforcement and Industry Reactions To demonstrate the significance of the \\"kill switch,\\" it's essential to cover reactions from law enforcement agencies and the mobile device industry. This involves discussing the ways in which the new feature is expected to deter thieves, reduce the illegal resale market for stolen iPhones, and improve overall mobile device security. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore whether other mobile device manufacturers are planning on adopting similar security measures. Step 4: Highlighting Potential Concerns and Future Improvements Finally, while the introduction of the \\"kill switch\\" is a notable step towards enhancing mobile device security, the article should discuss potential concerns and areas for future development. This may include addressing possible flaws in the new security feature, the extent of its effectiveness against determined criminals, and whether further enhancements could be introduced in future operating system updates. Conclusion: The iPhone \\"kill switch\\" feature is a major milestone in the fight against mobile device theft and \\"Apple picking.\\" By adding increased password protection to crucial features, it becomes significantly more difficult for criminals to profit from stolen iPhones. Though potential concerns and future improvements should not be overlooked, the \\"kill switch\\" sends a strong message that innovative technologies have the power to combat crime and protect consumers' valuable personal devices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\".

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother.

Given the below context: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought... Guess a valid title for it!

At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\").

Moreover, the user describes the earrings as \\"thin and flimsy,\\" which suggests that they may not be satisfied with the quality and durability of the product.

The exchange occurred on Happy Finnish Christmas, the sixth episode of the first season of the show, which was released on Amazon Prime on 23 December. In front of a live audience, Clarkson pointed to an image of the interior of a Rolls Royce, saying: “The only problem is that in one of those, you couldn’t enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice-cream.” “It’s all right, I don’t eat ice-cream,” replied Hammond. “It’s something to do with being straight.” Ollie Cole (@ProducerOllie) 🤗 hello & here's the full richard hammond 'ice creams are gay' piece and yeah, it's awful pic.twitter.com/JhDisRsc1Q Clarkson and May appeared taken aback as members of the studio audience applauded and cheered. “Why are you applauding him?” Clarkson, apparently aghast, asked the crowd. “What do you mean? … You’re saying all children are homosexual?” The Grand Tour is everything that was wrong with Clarkson-era Top Gear Read more Hammond continued, saying: “Ice-cream is a bit – you know”. He added: “There’s nothing wrong with it, but a grown man eating an ice-cream – it’s that way, rather than that way … “I’m right. I can’t believe you can’t see that. It’s easy. It’s in front of you.” Clarkson and Hammond then joked about “the chocolate thingy” in a 99 ice-cream cone, with the latter declaring: “My case rests!” A spokesman for LGBT equality charity Stonewall said Hammond’s choice of words was not only ridiculous, but “chosen purposefully to mock and belittle”. “Stonewall trains teachers to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic slurs like these, so to hear this sort of language on television is extremely disappointing and sends the wrong message to young people.” Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: “It is a perverse world when an everyday pleasure like ice cream becomes the butt of homophobic innuendo. That Richard Hammond thinks he needs to boast his heterosexuality is weird ... His pandering to prejudice is bad enough but the audience applause makes it worse. It shows that we still have some way to go to end bigoted banter.” The exchange was also met with disdain on Twitter. “Excuse me while I gag on my Cornetto,” tweeted Olly Alexander, the lead singer of the British electronic pop trio Years & Years. olly alexander (@alexander_olly) really tho no wonder some straight guys are fucked up they can't even have ice cream Another Twitter user criticised Hammond for choosing to use his platform to crack “a few totally unnecessary jokes about a marginalised group, using stereotypes that don’t even exist”.

Are men that watch this show bigoted weasels? pic.twitter.com/G4W9ziqLch Hammond had not responded to any of the criticism on Twitter at time of writing. The first episode of The Grand Tour broadcast in late November to much interest from fans of Top Gear, following Hammond, May and Clarkson’s departure from the long-running BBC World franchise. “They open their mouths and suddenly it’s same-old same-old,” wrote Sam Wollaston in his review of the new show for the Guardian. “Nought to racist in less than 10 minutes.” In the first episode, Clarkson joked that he could not be fired “because we’re on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse”. On that occasion, Wollaston wrote, it was May and Hammond who looked “faintly embarrassed”. ||||| TV presenter Richard Hammond has been criticised after making a joke about eating ice cream being gay. He was responding to a comment made by Jeremy Clarkson on The Grand Tour. Talking to an audience, co-host Clarkson points at a photo of a Volvo's interior and says: \\"The only problem is that in one of those, you couldn't enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice cream.\\" Richard Hammond replied: \\"It's all right, I don't eat ice cream. It's something to do with being straight.\\" After the audience on the Amazon Prime show applauded, Jeremy Clarkson asks: \\"Why are you applauding him? What do you mean? You're saying all children are homosexual?\\" Richard Hammond replies: \\"What? What? Ice cream is a bit - you know... There's nothing wrong with it, but a grown man eating an ice cream - it's that way, rather than that way. \\"I'm right. I can't believe you can't see that. It's easy. It's in front of you.\\" But Twitter users aren't happy about the comments. Years & Years singer Olly Alexander made a joke about it while others people went further. LGBT campaigner, Peter Tatchell, has also criticised Richard Hammond. Speaking on BBC 5 Live Daily, he's told Adrian Chiles that he thinks the comments \\"pander to prejudice\\". \\"It's a perverse world when everyday pleasures like ice cream becomes the butt of homophobic innuendo,\\" he said. \\"That Richard Hammond thinks he needs to boast about his heterosexuality is weird and it will get people wondering, 'Why? Why is he saying that?' \\"His pandering to prejudice is bad enough, of course. But the audience applause that he got makes it even worse, and I think it shows that we still have some way to go to end bigoted banter.\\" There's no word yet from Richard Hammond or the producers of The Grand Tour. The comments were made on the sixth episode of the Amazon Prime show, which was called Happy Finnish Christmas. It was released on 23 December. A spokesman for LGBT equality charity Stonewall said: \\"Hammond's choice of words were not just ridiculous, but chosen purposefully to mock and belittle. \\"This is the sort of childish language heard in playgrounds across Britain. \\"Stonewall trains teachers to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic slurs like these, so to hear this sort of language on television is extremely disappointing and sends the wrong message to young people.\\" In the same episode Richard Hammond also takes a dig at the Top Gear scene filmed at the Cenotaph in central London earlier this year. Driving a Mustang on a tour of the city, he says: \\"That is the Cenotaph, where we remember those who died fighting for us. Slow down a bit here, show some respect.\\" The BBC show, formerly fronted by The Grand Tour's Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, was criticised after new host Matt LeBlanc and a professional driver performed \\"doughnuts\\" near the war memorial. Former co-host Chris Evans apologised for the stunt, and said he and the crew were \\"mortified\\".

Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her. Unwilling to admit his feelings, Linus confesses his scheme to Sabrina at the last minute and sends her back to Paris. Before she gets on the plane to Paris, her father informs her that over the years of chauffeuring the father of David and Linus, he listened. When Mr. Larrabee sold, he sold and when Mr. Larrabee bought, he bought.

The Select from: [a]. bat must be sturdily made.. [b]. other equipment must be sturdily made..","completion":"The sentence should end with option [b]. \\"The other equipment must be sturdily made.\\" Here is the completed sentence followed by a detailed explanation: \\"At softball practice, Clare ruined the bat, but her other equipment was fine. The other equipment must be sturdily made.\\" This sentence is highlighting the fact that while Clare somehow managed to ruin the bat during her softball practice, her other equipment, such as her gloves, helmet, and cleats, remained in good condition. From this observation, one could infer that Clare's other equipment is of higher quality or more durable compared to the bat that was ruined. Softball equipment can vary widely in terms of quality and durability. Some bats, such as wooden ones, may break or splinter with heavy or repeated use, while aluminum or composite bats are typically more resistant to damage. Similarly, helmets, gloves, and cleats can also vary in their construction materials and design, potentially affecting their ability to withstand heavy use or impacts during play. With this sentence, the focus is on emphasizing the contrast between the bat and the other equipment by highlighting their different outcomes during practice. It suggests that while the bat wasn't able to withstand the demands of practice, the other equipment remained intact, which implies that the other equipment is sturdier in nature. In essence, the complete sentence paints a picture of a softball practice where the player, Clare, experienced a mishap with her bat while the rest of her gear proved to be more reliable.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Fox News Inspiring Climate Science Fox News would seem to be an unlikely source of inspiration for climate scientists, but amid the pundits and the botched infographics, Rupert Murdoch‘s fair and balanced news team struck a nerve on climate change. The news reported was this: Despite all this talk about global warming, the past decade actually saw less warming than the previous 30 years. Explain that, climate changers! While it is true that temperatures plateaued from 1998 to 2008, that fact, taken out of the broader context of climate, leads to all sorts of false assumptions. And so it is that, when confronted by yet another member of the public citing the Fox News stat, climate scientist Robert Kaufmann set about finding a scientific explanation. The thing is, there’s nothing at all straightforward about climate science. Kaufmann’s initial report, published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and a paper by another group of researchers trying to explain the cooling, published yesterday in Science, are just the latest examples. As the BBC’s Richard Black points out, “Emitting excess greenhouse gases is only one of the ways in which human industry, agriculture, and transport are affecting the atmosphere.” The latest studies point out that both humans and nature emit sulfate aerosols (tiny particles)–humans by burning fossil fuels, and nature by kicking around dust and volcanic ash (hey, watch it, nature). Although other theories remain about why this past decade was cooler than those previous, scientists seem to be converging around this idea that sulfate particles, which reflect the sun, are the culprits. Kaufmann’s paper pointed at the rapid increase in coal production in China, and the consequent emission of sulfate particles in the low atmosphere, as the cause. So … coal combats global warming? Erm, no. Although sulfate particles may have had the short-term effect of cooling temperatures, in the long run, pumping CO2 into the atmosphere spells trouble. And in fact those same sulfate particles are a primary ingredient in acid rain, so loading the atmosphere with them is probably not a good idea either (although geoengineering proponents have suggested doing exactly that to help cool the climate). Other scientists have noted that while coal production has been increasing in China over the past several years, it has been decreasing elsewhere. According to Hiram Levy, a climate modeler at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, there has been an overall increase of 10 percent in sulfate emissions over the last decade, which wouldn’t be enough to explain the slowdown. Enter this month’s second big climate science paper, which includes new research from NOAA as well as other groups. Their theory builds upon Kaufmann’s, positing that it was sulfate particles released in the stratosphere–not the atmosphere–that caused cooling, and that the sulfates could have come from human activity, natural causes, or a combination of the two. All of which illustrates one of the big problems with climate science: communication. How do you explain to people who don’t study climate that what is often referred to as “global warming” doesn’t mean a steady warming of temperatures over time? That today’s weather may have nothing at all to do with the climate on the whole? That there are multiple natural and human activities happening in tandem and having various, complex effects on the climate? That, as Mike Lemonick of Climate Central eloquently puts it, “Anthropogenic warming has never been predicted to be steady. Understanding episodes of faster and slower warming has always been a goal of climate scientists.” It has taken some of the brightest scientists in the world over a year’s worth of research to look at all the inputs into the climate and come up with some plausible theories to explain what it’s doing. And that was all sparked by a Fox News citation. The trouble is, the 600 or so words above don’t fit neatly into a soundbyte or an infographic, nor do the complexities of climate science, so the chances of mainstream audiences getting a truly fair and balanced view of climate change remain slim.","completion":"Fox News mentioned that the past decade had less warming than the previous 30 years. A climate scientist, Robert Kaufmann, wanted to find out why this was true. He discovered that sulfate particles might be the reason. These particles come from humans burning fossil fuels and from nature, like dust and volcanic ash. They reflect sunlight, which can make the Earth cooler. Kaufmann thinks that China's increased coal production might be causing more sulfate particles in the atmosphere. However, even if these particles can cool the Earth temporarily, they are also a main part of acid rain and might be adding to other climate problems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Michigan Alcohol-Screening Test (MAST), developed in 1971, is a tool used to screen for alcohol abuse and dependence; however, it doesn't necessarily mean that the subjects taking the test are intoxicated or too drunk at the time of taking the test. The MAST was designed to help health professionals identify individuals who may have problematic alcohol use and who may require further assessment or intervention. It is a self-report questionnaire with the purpose of gathering information about an individual's alcohol consumption, its consequences, and potential patterns indicative of abuse or dependence. It is not a test specifically aimed at intoxicated individuals, nor does it require intoxication or drunkenness to be completed. The MAST can be administered in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, clinics, educational institutions, or rehabilitation centers. It is triggered by different factors such as individual self-referral, professional referral, or as part of a broad screening battery. The individuals who take the MAST don't necessarily have to be drunk at the moment of taking the test; therefore, the claim that most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions is not supported by the premise. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that a screening tool such as the MAST is only the first step in determining whether a person has alcohol-related problems. It can provide an indication of problematic alcohol use, but further assessment, such as a comprehensive clinical interview, additional tests, or collateral information, is required to establish a clear diagnosis and determine an appropriate treatment plan. In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis \\"Most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions.\\" The premise itself does not directly address the intoxication levels of individuals taking the test, nor does the purpose or administration practices of the MAST make such a claim plausible. A screening tool like the MAST is designed to identify potential alcohol abuse or dependence, rather than focusing on the state of intoxication of the test-takers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Warren has revealed he has hit a wall of silence in efforts to make a world-title fight between Tyson Fury and Wladimir Klitschko, with Fury all but giving up hope that the bout will happen. The veteran promoter has written to Klitschko’s representatives to make a fight in March between the Ukrainian world champion and Fury, the mandatory challenger for his WBO world title. But there has been no reply to the email and Warren confirmed there have been no positive indications that the younger Klitschko will fight Fury. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tyson Fury: I'm convinced Wladimir Klitschko won't fight me. Tyson Fury, who destroyed Dereck Chisora, may not get his chance to fight Wladimir Klitschko. Frank Warren and Fury were at the Landmark Hotel in London to promote his next fight on February 28. Klitschko is scheduled to fight in March and will then have to fight Fury or vacate the WBO portion of his collection of world titles. Warren said: ‘We wrote to klitschko’s people, “Why don’t we cut to chase and do the fight in March?” They have not even responded to say “s** off” or “not interested”. ‘I’ve heard nothing at all. The fight will be mandated by the WBO after his next fight. They will then have to sit down with us.’ Should Klitschko vacate it will validate a prediction unbeaten Fury made three years ago. Warren said he had written to Wladimir Klitschko's representatives but not heard anything back. He extended his record to 23 wins from 23 fights against Dereck Chisora last month and is due to fight again on February 28 at the O2 Arena – a card that will also feature Chris Eubank Jnr. But his target is Klitschko, though he doesn’t believe the fight will happen. ‘I have said for three years that I don’t think he will ever fight me,’ Fury said. ‘That is my opinion. I can’t see that happening. I would like to fight for the title and take it off him rather than fighting for a vacant title. ‘It is OK (Klitschko) fighting bums, but a guy who can change tempo and style? That is different. I don’t think he is ready for that.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"So, this article is talking about a possible boxing match between two famous boxers, Tyson Fury and Wladimir Klitschko. Frank Warren, who is like a boss for Tyson Fury, is trying to set up a big fight between them. But, Wladimir Klitschko and his team have not responded to Frank Warren's emails about making this happen. Tyson Fury really wants to fight Wladimir Klitschko, but he feels like it might not happen. If they do not fight, Wladimir Klitschko might have to let go of one of his boxing titles. Frank and Tyson are promoting another fight that will happen on February 28th, at O2 Arena, but their main goal is to fight against Wladimir Klitschko."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: i. Rub wax paper all over the headlight until it's see through again. ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see through again.","completion":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, the more sound solution to make a headlight less cloudy is option ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see-through again. Here's an analysis of both the solutions: i. Rub wax paper all over the headlight until it's see-through again: Using wax paper on headlights might initially sound like an easy and inexpensive solution, but it does not appropriately address the core issue of cloudy headlights. The cloudiness on headlights is typically formed by the gradual wear and degradation of the outer layer of the headlight, which is made of a plastic material called polycarbonate. This wear and degradation are often caused by exposure to sunlight, debris, and dirt and lead to oxidation which manifests as the cloudy appearance. Although rubbing wax paper on the surface of the headlight might smoothen it temporarily, it does not effectively remove the degraded outer layer or significantly reduce oxidation. Consequently, this method lacks the capacity to provide a long-lasting solution to restore the headlight's clarity. ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see-through again: Using sandpaper to address cloudy headlights is a more effective solution, as this method removes the oxidized and degraded outer layer of the polycarbonate material, revealing a clearer surface underneath. This method typically involves the following steps: 1. Clean the headlight using soap and water to remove surface dirt and dust. 2. Mask off the surrounding areas of the headlight to protect the vehicle's paint from accidental sanding. 3. Soak sandpaper (preferably with grit ratings of around 800, 1200, and 2000) in water for a few minutes prior to use. The wet-sanding method reduces friction-generated heat and helps to remove debris and excess material more efficiently. 4. Begin with a lower grit sandpaper (800 grit) and rub it over the headlight in a back-and-forth or circular motion while keeping the sandpaper and headlight surface wet. After consistent use of the 800 grit, switch to the 1200 grit and continue the same process, and eventually move up to the 2000 grit sandpaper. 5. Clean the headlight surface with water during each change of grit rating to observe the progress and ensure all cloudiness is removed. 6. After removing the oxidized layer using sandpaper, apply a plastic polish to restore the headlight's shine and clarity further. The polish can be applied using a microfiber cloth or with a polishing pad attached to a drill for best results. 7. As a final step, use a UV-protectant sealant (such as a clear coat) to protect the headlight from further degradation, thereby prolonging its clarity. In conclusion, based on naive physics reasoning, solution ii (using sandpaper) is more effective in removing cloudiness and restoring the transparency of a headlight compared to solution i (using wax paper). The sandpaper method not only removes the degraded, oxidized outer layer but also provides a longer-lasting result coupled with the application of plastic polish and a UV-protectant sealant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Information: - Zynoviy Bohdan Khmelnytsky (Ruthenian language: ii; modern ; \\"Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky\\" 6 August 1657), was the Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth (now part of Ukraine). He led an uprising against the Commonwealth and its magnates (16481654) which resulted in the creation of a state led by the Cossacks of Ukraine. In 1654, he concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with the Tsardom of Russia. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to the deaths of an estimated 18,000 -100,000 Jews. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Khmelnytsky Uprising (; also known as the Cossack-Polish War, Chmielnicki Uprising, or the Khmelnytsky insurrection) was a Cossack rebellion within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 16481657, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukrainian lands. Under the command of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, allied with the Crimean Tatars and local peasantry, fought against the armies and paramilitary forces of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against the civilian population, especially against the Roman Catholic clergy and the Jews. - Adam Kisiel , also Adam Kysil ( Polish : Adam Kisiel Ukrainian : ; 1580 or 1600 - 1653 ) was a Polish nobleman , the Voivode of Kiev ( 1649 - 1653 ) and castellan or voivode of Czernihów ( 1639 - 1646 ) . He was the last Orthodox senator of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth . Kisiel has become better known for his mediation during the Khmelnytsky Uprising . - The Zaporozhian Cossacks, Zaporozhian Cossack Army, Zaporozhian Host or simply Zaporozhians (, ) were Cossacks who lived beyond the rapids of the Dnieper River, the land also known under the historical term Wild Fields in today's Central Ukraine. Today much of its territory is flooded by the waters of Kakhovka Reservoir. - The Cossack Hetmanate, officially known as the Rus State or Zaporizhian Host ( , \\"Viysk Zaporozk\\"), was a Ukrainian Cossack state in Central Ukraine between 1649 and 1764 (some sources claim until 1782).

He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself.

Sweltering heat has enveloped the countries in the region, and as power consumption has risen to match the ever-increasing demand for air conditioning and cooling systems, energy providers are scrambling to maintain a steady supply of electricity. The unprecedented heatwave is primarily affecting the countries within Southeast Europe, such as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, and Turkey. Temperatures in these countries have soared significantly above the seasonal average and meteorologists anticipate that this trend will continue for at least the next few days. In Greece, an extreme heatwave has led to temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), causing multiple forest fires and prompting authorities to enforce strict power consumption regulations. Many fear that the heatwave could trigger memories of a similar calamity in 2007, in which numerous forest fires wreaked havoc with devastating consequences. As such, the Greek government has urged citizens to minimize the use of electrical appliances in order to alleviate the strain on the national power grid. In neighboring Bulgaria, the high temperatures have caused a power plant malfunction, thereby decreasing the country's overall power generation capacity. The country is now relying heavily on imports to meet its rapidly increasing electricity demand. Authorities have warned that if the heatwave persists, there is a risk of power outages, which could severely impact the daily lives of Bulgarian citizens. Romania, too, has witnessed a spike in electricity consumption as a result of the scorching heat, with power prices surging by around 10% in response. Serbia is working relentlessly to maintain uninterrupted power supply while contending with the impacts of climate change. Meanwhile, Croatia and Turkey are both experiencing increased electricity demand due to the soaring heat, with the latter particularly concerned about potential power shortages during the summer months. Amidst this surge in energy demand, experts have attributed the abnormally high temperatures to global warming and adverse effects of climate change. These extreme weather conditions reiterate the importance of adopting sustainable practices and committing to renewable energy solutions to mitigate potential crises in the future. In the midst of the ongoing crisis in Southeast Europe, it is crucial that governments and energy providers devise strategies to overcome the challenges posed by rising global temperatures. This may involve investing in renewable energy resources, fortifying existing power infrastructure, and encouraging citizens to adopt energy-efficient practices to lower overall consumption. As the first heatwave of the summer continues to test the power resources of Southeast Europe, countries within the region must prepare to adapt to these extreme conditions, both in the present and in anticipation of rising global temperatures in the years to come. The sweltering heat serves as a stark reminder of the ever-growing threat climate change poses to our planet, urging both local and global communities to take immediate, unified action in the pursuit of a sustainable, eco-friendly future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are the economics of the netherlands Suggested answer: In 2009 the economy declined with 3.5%, followed by two years of mild growth. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"Partial, as it only provides a limited view of the Netherlands' economy. The economic situation of the Netherlands involves many more aspects, and providing just a small fragment of its historical context may mislead or confuse those seeking a comprehensive understanding. The Netherlands is a highly developed, open, and export-oriented economy. In recent years, the Netherlands has consistently ranked among the world's leading economies, often appearing in the top 20 by nominal GDP and top 15 by GDP (PPP) per capita. Here's a more detailed overview of the economics of the Netherlands: 1. Industry and agriculture: The country has diverse economic sectors, including services, manufacturing, and agriculture. Major industries in the Netherlands include agro-industries, natural gas, chemicals, food, metal and engineering, electrical machinery and equipment, and tourism. 2. Trade: The Netherlands is a significant exporter, as a result of the presence of the Port of Rotterdam (Europe's largest port) and its unique geographic location. Its significant trading partners include Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. 3. Financial sector: The financial industry, particularly banking and insurance, is also crucial to the Dutch economy. Several multinational financial institutions, such as ABN AMRO and ING Group are headquartered in the Netherlands. 4. Fiscal policies and public finances: The country pursues sound fiscal policies and adheres to European policy guidelines on debt and deficit indicators. The Netherlands has successfully maintained low public debt and budget deficit levels compared to other European countries. These factors have contributed to the stability of its economy. 5. Labor market: Unemployment rates have been consistently low, oscillating around 3-4% in recent years. This indicates a healthy labor market, which contributes to the country's overall prosperity. 6. Eurozone membership: The Netherlands has been a member of the European Union since 1958 and adopted the euro (€) as its official currency in 1999. This has fostered economic integration and trade across the Eurozone region. 7. Recent economic growth: While it's true that the Dutch economy experienced a decline of 3.5% in 2009, the subsequent years witnessed a recovery, with its GDP growth rate ranging between 1-3% since 2014, which indicates a relatively stable trajectory. In conclusion, the suggested answer does not provide a sufficient overview of the economics of the Netherlands. A more accurate validation of the answer would require including more in-depth information on various economic aspects, sectors, and trends that pertain to the Dutch economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Time Warner Cable and CBS reach deal to restore network to 3m US homes CBS Corp said it has reached an agreement with Time Warner Cable Inc to end a month-long blackout of its stations. Photograph: Reuters A month-long standoff between Time Warner Cable and CBS that prevented millions of viewers from watching the top-rated network in the US ended when the two sides resolved their dispute. The deal covers more than 3m homes in New York, Dallas and Los Angeles that had not been able to receive programming from CBS or CBS-owned channels since 2 August. Broadcasting resumed Monday evening on the east coast. The companies had been fighting over how much TWC would pay for programming on CBS and other channels, including Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and the Smithsonian channel. Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. The agreement includes retransmission fees the cable operator pays to CBS per subscriber, which had been a sticking point. The disagreement came at a touchy time for networks and cable companies as more and more Americans are turning to alternative ways to watch TV, including online or on internet-connected TVs. Added pressure was on the two companies to reach an agreement with CBS holding deals to broadcast NFL and Southeastern Conference football, as well as the start of the US Open tennis. The blackout affected about 1.1m of New York's 7.4m television households that get CBS. An estimated 1.3m of 5.6m households in Los Angeles were blacked out, along with 400,000 of Dallas' 2.6m TV homes, CBS said. Those are three of the nation's five most populous television markets. CBS estimated the blackout cut the network's national viewership by about 1%. The talks were being closely watched beyond these companies and their customers because of the idea that a retransmission agreement would set a precedent for future negotiations between networks and cable or satellite companies. Another point of contention was the cable operator's access to CBS material for on-demand or mobile device viewing. \\"While we certainly didn't get everything we wanted, ultimately we ended up in a much better place than when we started,\\" TWC chief executive Glenn Britt said in a statement. Mignon L Clyburn, acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a statement saying she was \\"pleased CBS and Time Warner Cable have resolved their retransmission consent negotiations, which for too long have deprived millions of consumers of access to CBS programming\\". In the end, she added, media companies should \\"accept shared responsibility\\" for putting their audiences' interests above other interests. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"So, there was a disagreement between two big companies, Time Warner Cable and CBS, about how much money they should pay each other for showing their TV shows. This disagreement led to a month-long blackout, which means some people couldn't watch CBS TV programs on Time Warner Cable for a while. But now, the good news is that these two companies have found a solution and agreed on something, so now, around 3 million homes in the US, including in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles can watch CBS programs again. This makes a lot of people happy, and the people who run these companies are pleased that they found a way to fix the problem."},{"prompt":"Question: The death of languages is not a new phenomenon. Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as a very high death rate. Only a few, including Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Latin, have lasted more than 2,000 years. What is new, however, is the speed at which they are dying out. Europe's colonial conquests caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eliminating at least 15 percent of all languages spoken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. The rise of nation-states has also been decisive in selecting and consolidating national languages and sidelining others. By making great efforts to establish an official language in education, the media and the civil service, national governments have deliberately tried to eliminate minority languages. This process of linguistic standardization has been boosted by industrialization and scientific progress, which have imposed new methods of communication that are swift, straightforward and practical. Language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge. Monolingualism became an ideal. More recently, the internationalization of financial markets, the spread of information by electronic media and other aspects of globalization have intensified the threat to \\"small\\" languages. A language not on the Internet is a language that \\"no longer exists\\" in the modern world. It is out of the game. The serious effects of the death of languages are evident. First of all, it is possible that if we all ended up speaking the same language, our brains would lose some of their natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We would never be able to figure out the origins of human language or resolve the mystery of \\"the first language\\". As each language dies, a chapter of human history closes. Multilingualism is the most accurate reflection of multiculturalism. The destruction of the first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second....

Y en 1868 entró a estudiar derecho en la Universidad de Viena. Después de la lectura de Herbert Spencer, Einleitung in das Studium der Soziologie (Introducción al estudio de la sociología), comenzó a interesarse por la economía política. En el año 1875 Wieser, ál cabo de trabajar 10 años como empleado del gobierno, recibió una beca para la Universidad de Heidelberg, en Alemania, para estudiar economía política junto a Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, de quien era amigo de la juventud y más tarde sería cuñado. Ambos pasan a ser discípulos de Carl Menger, siendo este último 11 años mayor que Wieser. A pesar de que ninguno de los dos fuera alumno directo, recibieron su influencia a través de la lectura de los Grundsätze (1871), obra que les encaminó finalmente hacia el estudio de la economía política.

They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (De Niro), her mother Dina (Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses.

How can we make women feel safe in indian society? Available options: a). no b). yes The answer is:","completion":"a). no While both questions are related to women's safety and rights in India, they are distinct and address different aspects of the issue. The first question, \\"What are women's rights like in India in 2014?\\" focuses on the legal framework and societal norms regarding women's rights during that specific year. To answer this question, one would typically examine the laws and government policies in place at the time to address gender inequality and ensure women's rights. This would include looking at the Constitution of India, which guarantees equality to women, as well as various acts and amendments passed in 2013 and 2014 in response to the high-profile 2012 Delhi gang-rape case. One might also analyze the enforcement of these laws and the extent to which they effectively secured women's rights in practice. Key issues to be considered in this question could include: 1. Legal rights: Examining the framework of laws and regulations that protect women's rights, such as the right to equal pay, inheritance, and property ownership. 2. Education: Assessing the access to education for girls and women in India and the efforts made to improve literacy rates. This could also include information on school enrolment and dropout rates. 3. Health: Analyzing the availability of healthcare services for women, including reproductive health and maternal health services, as well as initiatives aimed at improving women's health. 4. Political representation: Evaluating the participation of women in political decision-making, such as the number of female politicians in national and local governments, and measures implemented to encourage more women to engage in politics. 5. Social and cultural norms: Investigating the prevalence of traditional customs, practices, and attitudes that perpetuate gender discrimination and impact women's rights, such as dowry, child marriage, and gender-based violence. The second question, \\"How can we make women feel safe in Indian society?\\" is concerned with strategies and measures that can be implemented to promote a sense of security and wellbeing for women in India. This question seeks solutions to the problem of women's safety and asks what can be done to create a more inclusive and equitable society where women can safely exercise their rights. Possible measures to address women's safety in India could include: 1. Strengthening legislation: Enacting and enforcing comprehensive laws and policies to address gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination. 2. Improving law enforcement and judicial processes: Reforming police and judicial systems to ensure that cases of violence against women are handled efficiently and effectively, and that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions. 3. Promoting education and awareness: Raising awareness about women's rights and the importance of gender equality among different segments of society, including men, women, and young people. This could involve implementing gender-sensitive curricula in schools and promoting public campaigns about women's rights. 4. Empowering women: Encouraging women's participation in decision-making processes at all levels, including in politics, business, and community life, to ensure that their interests, needs, and concerns are addressed. 5. Creating safe public spaces: Implementing measures to make public spaces, such as public transport, parks, and markets, more secure for women by installing better lighting, surveillance, and policing. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the issue of women's rights and safety in India, they approach the topic from different angles and require different sets of information to answer.

Question: I do not fully understand exactly what you are asking so I will restate what I believe you are asking and then I will answer it. What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not. For years I have given assignments via email and I have collected assignments via email. Nothing has ever gotten lost this way and things are timestamped. I do not have to make photocopies and even students who are not present the day that the assignment is announced in class, get the assignment in a timely manner. One young lady told me, “I turned it in but you must have lost it.” “Okay,” I said, “Open your sent folder and show me that you sent it.” She replied by saying, “I delete my sent folder to keep from clogging up my email.” I told her that I understood and that she could show me an empty sent folder to prove that she was telling the truth. She said, “I lied.” Question: What happened after the student said she had turned in her assignment but the teacher must have lost it? Options: - the student admitted to bringing the assignment - the teacher said open your sent folder - not enough information - the student explained that she deletes her assignment === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The student admitted to lying about turning in the assignment. In the detailed anecdote that was provided, the teacher had a system in place for giving and receiving assignments that eliminated excuses for loss and late submissions. The teacher would send out assignments via email and would also collect them in a similar manner. This method allowed for everything to be timestamped, thus avoiding unnecessary disputes over timing and also eliminating the need for making physical photocopies. In this instance, when a student claimed that she had turned in her assignment but the teacher must have lost it, the teacher asked her to show proof of submission by opening her 'sent' folder. However, the student insisted that she always deleted her sent folder to avoid clogging her email. The teacher remained steadfast and offered the student an opportunity to prove her claim by simply showing an empty sent folder, implying that her regular clean-up of sent items would have resulted in the absence of the alleged sent email submission which she stated had been missed by the teacher. Under the pressure of these simple but foolproof verification tactics, the student eventually admitted to having lied about submitting the assignment. This incident highlights an effective strategy that educators can utilize to hold students accountable for their work by leveraging the technology at their disposal, also emphasizing the course of action one can take to verify the claims made by the students, ensuring academic honesty, and maintaining the integrity of the academic process. The report of a gun-wielding mouse may have been an amusing excuse for tardiness, but it appears no such creativity could bypass the teacher's email submission system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect. For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for... contains an answer for the question: What was the name of Speer's son?, what is it ?","completion":"The name of Speer's son mentioned in the article is Fritz."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998.

Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present). - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993.

They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner. - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed.

Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

The London Eye is a giant cantilevered observation wheel situated on the South Bank of the River Thames in London, England. As a significant symbol of the city, it offers spectacular views of London's skyline and has become a popular tourist attraction. David Marks and Julia Barfield, a husband-and-wife architect team, designed the London Eye as their entry for a competition organized by The Sunday Times newspaper and Great Britain's Architecture Foundation in 1993. The competition was held to mark the turn of the millennium and called for innovative designs for a new public attraction. Although their design concept was not the winner, the couple took their idea forward and eventually brought it to fruition. They established the Marks Barfield Architects company, through which they managed the design and construction of the London Eye. Construction began in 1998, and the observation wheel was finally completed in 1999, opening to the public on March 9, 2000, following a technical glitch that delayed the opening. The London Eye stands at an impressive height of 135 meters (443 feet) and has a diameter of 120 meters (394 feet). It was the world's tallest Ferris wheel until 2006 when the Star of Nanchang in China surpassed it. The wheel consists of 32 sealed and climate-controlled passenger capsules, each capable of holding up to 25 people. As passengers slowly rotate around the axis, they enjoy a unique perspective of iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul's Cathedral, The Shard, and the Tower of London, among others. Built with cutting-edge engineering techniques and materials, the London Eye features an A-frame design that allows it to gracefully cantilever over the Thames. The design is a blend of both modern architecture and traditional components, such as its support structure being reminiscent of a bicycle wheel with a central hub and cable spokes. Over the years, the London Eye has become not just a London icon but also one of the United Kingdom's most visited paid attractions, drawing millions of visitors from around the world annually. Further cementing its importance as a landmark, it has been featured in movies, television shows, and various cultural events. In summary, the London Eye, designed by David Marks and Julia Barfield, has become a symbol of London's innovation and creativity. This iconic landmark continues to delight and inspire visitors, offering them breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

Jim learned that his garden is smooth while his driveway is rough by rolling a rock over them. 2. The question asks which one has less resistance. Step 1 tells us that the garden is smooth and the driveway is rough. A smooth surface generally has less resistance than a rough surface because it allows objects to slide or roll more easily. As the rock rolled more easily on the garden, it would have encountered less resistance than on the rough driveway. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) garden, as it has less resistance compared to the driveway."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Yes; Venera Gimadieva is indeed a soprano, as stated in the given information. She is specifically identified as an operatic soprano, which indicates that she is a singer with the highest voice range in the field of opera. This info was stated plainly - \\"Venera Gimadieva is a Russian operatic soprano\\" - which allows us to confidently affirm that Gimadieva is a soprano. Additionally, it's worth noting the specific type of soprano she is: a \\"lyric-coloratura.\\" This term refers to a specific type of soprano voice that is capable of executing fast, light, and agile coloratura passages, a certain type of ornamental, elaborate melody line. This term also encompasses the lyric quality of her voice, which suggests smooth and melodious singing. This extra detail does not alter the fact that she is a soprano but provides more depth to understanding her specific capabilities as a soprano. In concerts and operas, a soprano's role can often be that of the heroine, playing a crucial part in propelling the narrative, given the expressive and wide-ranging capabilities of the soprano voice. Sopranos often have exciting and challenging roles due to their significant vocal range and the dramatic possibilities this offers. Thus, being a soprano is a remarkable achievement, narratively crucial, and vocally challenging. Finally, Venera Gimadieva, apart from being a successful opera singer, is also a member of the Lake Baikal Foundation Community Board, indicating her involvement and commitment to charitable or community works. This showcases another dimension to her career – her dedication to supporting causes outside her immediate profession.

A:","completion":"The text refers to the category of \\"artist.\\" Specifically, it refers to Jang Woo Hyuk, a South Korean rapper who debuted in the boyband H.O.T. under SM Entertainment. The description includes key details about his dates of birth, his career in the music industry, and his association with a prominent entertainment company. The text does not mention anything related to any other category such as a company, educational institution, athlete, office holder, means of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, or written work. Therefore, the main focus is on Jang Woo Hyuk as an artist in the music industry. Artists, in this context, are individuals who engage in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating art. They use their creative skills in various types of art disciplines such as painting, sculpture, singing, dancing, acting, writing, filmmaking, and music. In Jang Woo Hyuk's case, his discipline is music where he has demonstrated his artistic capabilities through rap. Jang Woo Hyuk's career as a rapper and member of a boyband both align with this category. His debut with the boyband H.O.T. under SM Entertainment is particular to the music industry and describes his professional activities as an artist. In the world of real-life pop culture, the boyband H.O.T. was a significant highlight in the South Korean music scene, and Jang Woo Hyuk played a crucial role in this as one of its members. Being an artist also implies a certain level of prominence and influence. As part of H.O.T., Jang Woo Hyuk would have gained notoriety and established a fan base. This information enhances our understanding of Jang Woo Hyuk as an artist because it establishes his impact on audiences and the music scene. Summarily, this passage refers to an 'artist.' While other categories might form part of an artist's story—like the company they work with or the albums they produce—in this instance, the text exclusively discusses Jang Woo Hyuk's role and impact as a South Korean rapper. His journey, starting from his inception in 1996 with the boyband H.O.T., qualifies him as an artist that has engaged in creating, practicing, and demonstrating the art of rap music. His mention highlights his contribution to the South Korean music industry and, by extension, his stake in the larger world of art."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tony Bushby, 19, stabbed promising student Catherine Wynter more than 20 times then left her body alone with the youngsters, who stayed locked in the house with the corpse overnight. Bushby, who was obsessed by ‘all things dark and evil’, had tricked her into a relationship by creating a circle of fictitious Facebook friends, whom he used to talk himself up and persuade her to go out with him. Tricked: Promising student Catherine Wynter was murdered whilst babysitting in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The jury heard in an earlier hearing that Miss Wynter, 19, agreed to babysit for her sister Sabrina while she spent Boxing Day night with her boyfriend and his parents. Her mother Joy Davies went to check on her just after 8am on December 27 last year and saw blood on the front door. The children, three and four, came up to her at the door and said ‘Grandma, Katie’s dead’. Catherine’s mother Joy Davis then followed a trail of blood and found her daughter lying dead on the the kitchen floor at her sister’s home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in a pool of her own blood. The naive churchgoer, known as Katie, had been stabbed 23 times by karate expert Bushby to her neck and stomach including 13 fatal blows, St Albans Crown Court heard.

Murdered: Katy's mother Joy found her daughter slumped on the floor. Police went to visit him after they examined Katie’s laptop and phone and worked out he was probably her boyfriend. They then studied his computer and. found out he had set up a fictitious circle of friends on Facebook - all. of whom he had used to communicate with Katie, tricking her they were. real. The profile pages of Dan Tress, Cyn Darwin, Shane Pleuon and Krystal Stanguard featured photographs Bushby had found on the internet. In fact they were all him and reflected his ‘obesessions and interests’ in ‘all things dark and evil’. He even went on to blame one of his creations, Dan Tress, for Katie’s murder. Another, called Krystal Stanguard, claimed she was interested in 'all things dark and evil' and a third had the email address 'lokigodtrickster@hotmail.co.uk' - named after the Norse god of chaos and mischief. Mr Speak said: 'He systematically tricked Katie over a period of time into believing that she was in contact on Facebook not only with the defendant but also with a small circle of his close friends. 'In fact this small circle of friends were entirely fictitious, they were people the defendant had made up, they did not exist. 'Believing them to be real Katie would talk to them on Facebook. All the time that girl was caught up in a web of malicious deception which was created and controlled by this defendant for purposes of his own.' Bushby used the character to say things to her to gain her trust or the say flattering or impressive things about himself. Mr Speak said: 'He used them in effect to try and get her to like him.'

Now and then water splashed on the deck and the slack sails flapped. The fresh breeze had dropped, although the sea had not yet gone down, and Marston had set the topsail and the balloon jib.

He did not move and had not been altogether conscious for some time. Rupert wore Harry's white clothes and looked, in the unsteady light, like a rather haggard and jaundiced Englishman. Marston had noted his firm touch when he fixed the bandage and now he was methodically putting back some bottles in the medicine chest.

Under Chris Kennedy's leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007 from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving 200,000 in electricity costs in the first year. In 1990, the Mart Center began using Green Seal-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as Thermal Chicago, thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging CFCs. In 2006, MMPI joined Clean Air Counts, a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by 264,018 pounds (119,757 kg), the largest reduction by a commercial building. That same year, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved 5.5 million US gallons (21,000 m3) of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product. The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.

Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the given paragraph and then use the information provided in it, along with the hint, to arrive at a conclusion. The paragraph mentions that the planet of Sarahn is experiencing a significant geographic shift, with many of its continents breaking apart and moving. In contrast, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental movement for a while. The hint provided informs us that when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed due to increased volcanic activity. With this information, it can be inferred that since the continents on Sarahn are currently moving, there is likely more volcanic activity occurring on the planet compared to Timon, which has stable continents and thus, less volcanic activity. Answer: The volcanoes on Sarahn are more active than on Timon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Here is a question about this article: Switzerland voted against membership in the European Economic Area in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements. In March 2001, the Swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the EU. In recent years, the Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in many ways, in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness. The economy grew at 3% in 2010, 1.9% in 2011, and 1% in 2012. Full EU membership is a long-term objective of some in the Swiss government, but there is considerable popular sentiment against this supported by the conservative SVP party.

Pick your answer from: [+] None of the above choices . [+] We are running a relay race and we need fast runners . [+] I want to race the fastest because of my excellent athletic abilities . [+] It comes in handy when one is running from a police block .","completion":"The reason the narrator may be happy that Kayla is the fastest girl is because they are running a relay race, and they need fast runners. The context of the story revolves around the narrator's lack of athletic prowess, specifically in a race where they need to pick up a block and bring it back in a short amount of time. By having Kayla as the fastest girl in the class, it implies that they will be able to make up for any potential shortcomings in their own performance by having a fast teammate to help carry their team to victory. In addition to this, there are psychological factors that can come into play with having a strong team member, such as increased motivation and confidence, which can ultimately contribute to improved performance. The narrator, despite feeling apprehensive about their own athletic abilities, may feel at ease knowing that they have Kayla on their side, who is known for her excellent speed. Moreover, in the context of a relay race, each participant in the team plays a crucial role in the overall success of the group. A fast runner like Kayla can help compensate for any weak links or mishaps that may occur during the race, boosting the team's chances of claiming a blue award, which the narrator mentions as their goal. This would explain why the narrator is happy that Kayla is the fastest girl in the class. The other provided options do not fit as well in the context of the given text. The narrator does not express any desire to race the fastest person due to their excellent athletic abilities, nor do they mention running from a police block, which seems unrelated to their situation. Similarly, choosing \\"None of the above choices\\" would disregard the relevance of relay racing in the plot. Therefore, the most suitable reason for the narrator's happiness about Kayla being the fastest girl is that they are running a relay race and need fast runners to have a better chance at winning the blue award."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Admitting the problem is the first major step in dealing with it. If you first recognize the signs of your problem, you can then learn to modify your behavior. Signs and symptoms of a gambling problem include: getting a thrill from taking gambling risks, taking increasingly bigger gambling risks over time, a preoccupation with gambling, reliving past gambling experiences (through imagination or telling stories), using gambling as a way to escape problems or negative feelings, feeling guilt or remorse after gambling, and repeated failed efforts to cut back on gambling. Additional social issues associated with gambling include: taking time away from work or family life to gamble, concealing or lying about gambling, and borrowing money or stealing to gamble. Gambling excessively can cause many issues including: relationship problems, financial issues, legal problems, occupational concerns (job loss), substance use, poor health, and mental health issues (such as depression). Do you lose time from work to gamble? Do you extend yourself beyond your means by gambling away money that you have set aside to pay your rent, mortgage, or other bills? Do you use credit cards to gamble? Are you secretive about where the money's gone to after you've gambled? Make a list of all of the consequences you have encountered due to your gambling. Also, identify people you have hurt as a result of your gambling such as family and friends. Knowing the risks of gambling may help encourage people who gamble to consider the consequences before deciding to gamble. Excessive gambling can lead to depression, anxiety, aggression, increased suicide risk, relationship issues and stress-related illnesses. Gambling also increases stress levels (via the stress hormone cortisol) and your heart rate, which can lead to health risks. Pathological and addictive gambling can result in decreased decision-making skills and reduce your ability to evaluate the consequences of your actions. Don't be secretive about your finances or your gambling. Be honest with yourself and others about money spent gambling. Pay bills immediately, when you have funds set aside to pay them. Add up losses and keep a running tally. When you've added up losses from a gambling session, list the things that you might have purchased with that money, or other debts you could have paid down.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Answer: Options: 1). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser; 2). use just water to cleanse; 3). use abrasive soap; 4). not enough information; Answer:","completion":"1). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on?, using the article: The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The album that the song \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on is called \\"Something Else By The Kinks.\\" This album was released in 1967 and featured a progression of the band's sound by incorporating English music hall influences. \\"Death of a Clown\\" was a major UK chart success, co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, but also released as a Dave Davies solo single."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to \\"a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848\\"), as follows: We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal.\\" A:","completion":"The full name of the person whose situation makes them horridly sad and wretched is Valentin Alkan."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How is Lumpus scared of after Lazlo goes missing? The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job.

From the passage, the San Fernando Valley's legal aid program is stated to be 36 years old, while the Long Beach program is said to be 48 years old. The difference in age between the two programs is 12 years, so that part is correct, however, the original response given (\\"12 years\\") lacks context and comprehensiveness that should be inherent in a detailed and long answer. Here's a more detailed and long answer: The San Fernando Valley's legal aid program and the Long Beach program are stated to have considerable history, according to the passage. The San Fernando Valley program has been in operation for 36 years. Meanwhile, the Long Beach program has a longer history, with 48 years of operation. This highlights a difference in the establishment and potentially, the experience level of the two programs. Therefore, when we compare their ages, we can observe that the Long Beach program is older than the San Fernando Valley's legal aid program by 12 years. This age difference might explain their different levels of integration within their respective communities, outcomes in their endeavors to join with neighboring programs, and probably their varying approaches towards maintaining services for their clients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend is Carter. His full name is Gil Carter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the beginning the service here was so-so, the boutique is open by appointment only and whenever I attended appointments for my friend who was the bride we ended up waiting for our consultant to arrive. The store in itself is limited in selection and not in the greatest shape. I tried on a few dresses myself which were stained, had broken zippers etc... When one of the sample dresses was too large I had to be \\"clamped\\" into it (taking in the excess fabric from the back with a spring loaded clamp). Unfortunately this took with it a chunk of my flesh. I understand mistakes happen, but seriously... Ouch! My experience as a guest of the bride was mediocre but my friends experience as the bride in question has been horrific! I've encluded her side of the story. \\"I picked out my dress in January 2012 and got measured for it in September. I got a phone call a month later that they can't find a manufacturer to make my dress. Ok,disappointing, but I was offered a refund or the opportunity to pick a new dress. When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation. A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund. It's been a week and still no word from anyone at Iris D. Unacceptable.\\"","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as highly negative and critical. The reviewer recounts various issues they encountered during their visits to the boutique, including subpar service, limited selection, and poor condition of the dresses. They also mention a painful accident involving the clamp while trying on a dress, further affecting their overall experience. Additionally, the reviewer incorporates their friend's (the bride) perspective, which is described as 'horrific.' The bride experienced numerous issues, such as the boutique's inability to deliver the chosen dress, lack of clear communication from the staff and the owner, and problems in obtaining the refund she was promised. The overall tone of the review suggests extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment with the boutique's service, offerings, and lack of accountability."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that created the flagrant denial of their consitutional rights?, using the article: On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an injunction barring the protests and subsequently raised bail bond for those arrested from 200 to 1,500 (2,000 to 10,000 in 2019). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a \\"flagrant denial of our constitutional rights\\" and organizers prepared to defy the order. The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign. King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success. In a press release they explained, \\"We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation\\". Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell called King and the SCLC organizers \\"strangers\\" whose only purpose in Birmingham was \\"to stir inter-racial discord\\". Connor promised, \\"You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall.\\"The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. \\"I have never seen Martin so troubled\\", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: \\"The eyes of the world are on Birmingham tonight.

Q: Roland felt his stomach knotting. Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

I pushed on the table.","completion":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"I pushed on the table\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. To offer a comprehensive evaluation, let's break down each element of the sentence and analyze their roles within the sentence structure: 1. Subject: \\"I\\" - The subject of the sentence is the personal pronoun \\"I,\\" which denotes the person performing the action. In this case, the speaker is referring to themselves. The use of the pronoun \\"I\\" is grammatically correct as the subject of the sentence. 2. Verb: \\"pushed\\" - The verb \\"pushed\\" is a past-tense form of the verb \\"to push.\\" The verb \\"to push\\" is a regular verb, and as such, its simple past tense can be formed by adding \\"-ed\\" to the base form. In this sentence, \\"pushed\\" correctly expresses the action carried out by the subject, and its past tense usage is consistent with English grammar rules. 3. Preposition: \\"on\\" - The preposition \\"on\\" is used here to specify the relationship between the verb's action (pushing) and the object being acted upon (the table). It provides clarity about where the pushing is directed. Its usage as a preposition in this context is grammatically accurate. 4. Object: \\"the table\\" - The object of the sentence is \\"the table,\\" which refers to the entity affected by the action of pushing. The definite article \\"the\\" is used correctly to denote a specific table that the speaker is referring to, and the noun \\"table\\" is an appropriate object for the action of pushing. As a result, the object usage in the sentence is considered grammatically correct. Putting the sentence together, the structure is coherent and adheres to standard English grammar rules. The subject and verb are effectively paired, and the use of the preposition and object helps create a clear expression of the action being performed. While certain linguistic perspectives might question the necessity of the preposition \\"on,\\" as \\"I pushed the table\\" can convey a similar meaning, the presence of \\"on\\" does not invalidate the sentence from a grammatical standpoint. With this analysis, a linguist would likely deem the sentence \\"I pushed on the table\\" to be a valid English sentence, both grammatically and structurally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Which department store that closed in 1987 did Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon work at? Answer:","completion":"Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon, a highly respected advertising and marketing executive, worked at the renowned New York City department store, Gimbels, which ultimately closed its doors in 1987. Gimbels was a prominent department store in America operating from 1887 to 1987. Founded by Adam Gimbel, the store rapidly became a retail powerhouse, fueled primarily by their fierce rivalry with Macy's. The competition between Gimbels and Macy's even inspired the 1947 movie \\"Miracle on 34th Street.\\" At its peak, Gimbels had nearly 36 stores throughout New York City and its suburbs, as well as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon joined Gimbels in 1930 as an advertising copywriter. Her creative and innovative copywriting style quickly earned her promotions, first to the position of Head Copywriter, then to becoming the Advertising Director in 1937. Fitz-Gibbon's work played a significant role in establishing Gimbels as a retail giant. Her keen sense of customer behavior and market trends enabled her to devise highly successful marketing campaigns and promotions. One of Fitz-Gibbon's lasting legacies at Gimbels was the introduction of the slogan, \\"Nobody but nobody undersells Gimbels,\\" emphasizing their dedication to offering the best prices in the market. Under Fitz-Gibbon's leadership, Gimbels became known for its promotional innovations, which included being one of the first department stores to introduce money-back guarantees and sales events. During her tenure at Gimbels, Fitz-Gibbon also championed women’s professional growth in advertising. She established the first-ever research department in a department store and encouraged her team to create brilliant and effective ad campaigns. Despite its many achievements, Gimbels began to falter in the mid-20th century, as the retail landscape in America changed with the rise of suburban malls and discount stores. Eventually, Gimbels succumbed to financial pressures and announced in 1986 that it would close its doors. The department store officially ceased operations in 1987. Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon's career at Gimbels, where she worked for 18 years, significantly contributed to shaping the store's image and growth. However, with the closing of Gimbels in 1987, her impact on the company, much like the iconic department store itself, became a part of retail history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When we're done playing, I want you to put the ball back in this basket, okay?\\" Lucky wagged his tail, excited to learn something new. First, JoJo threw a ball for Lucky to fetch.

She ran over to JoJo and asked, \\"How did you teach your dog to do that?

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Directly after the events of Quarantine, on a flight from Los Angeles to Nashville, one of the passengers, Ralph Bundt becomes violent and attempts to enter the cockpit, demanding he be let off the plane. Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry (Josh Cooke) for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites one of the flight attendants, Paula, on the face, much to her friend, Jenny's (Mercedes Mason), horror. Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest and his co-pilot Willsy find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio). Everyone escapes the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens, and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be CDC scientists surround the terminal. Ed shows them a door that will lead them to tarmac level but it is locked. One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington (Noree Victoria), reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. Jenny, Henry, Ed, Niall, and Preston sneak back into the plane to retrieve it, to find that Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. Preston retrieves Doc and waits outside. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Niall's handgun and try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Niall shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Niall's eye. As they are leaving, they find Preston's body, and an infected Bev who tries to attack the group before they escape. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize...

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more rushing yards did Emmitt Smith have compared to Daryl Johnston?","completion":"Title: Comparing the Rushing Yards of Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston: A Tale of Two Legendary NFL Players Introduction Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston are two names that hold great significance in the world of professional football. Both players served as essential components of the Dallas Cowboys, contributing to the team's multiple Super Bowl victories in the 1990s. As running backs, Smith and Johnston were key offensive players in their respective positions. However, the differences in their roles and subsequent career statistics offer rich insights into the vast gap in their rushing yards. This article will delve deep into the career numbers of these two extraordinary athletes and provide an in-depth analysis of their contributions to the iconic Dallas Cowboys offense. Emmitt Smith – The All-Time Leading Rusher Emmitt Smith, affectionately known as the 'all-time leading rusher,' boasts a career so illustrious that it earned him a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The charismatic running back is often remembered for his incredible ability to find open spaces, evade tackles, and break free into the end zone. Over his 15-year tenure in the NFL (1990-2004), Smith amassed a staggering 18,355 rushing yards, the most in NFL history. Initially drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 1990 NFL Draft, Smith had a standout rookie season, recording 937 rushing yards and earning the Offensive Rookie of the Year title. It was evident from the beginning that he was destined for greatness. Throughout his career with the Cowboys and later the Arizona Cardinals, Smith recorded a total of 11 seasons with 1,000+ rushing yards. He achieved a personal best in the 1995 season, racking up 1,773 rushing yards. Smith's impressive career résumé comprises numerous individual accolades, such as being an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-team All-Pro, the 1993 NFL Most Valuable Player, and the 1990s All-Decade Team honoree. Furthermore, he was instrumental in the Cowboys' three Super Bowl titles, winning the Super Bowl XXVIII MVP award along the way. Daryl Johnston – The Unsung Hero Daryl 'Moose' Johnston, on the other hand, was an exceptional fullback whose chief responsibility centered around clearing the path for Emmitt Smith. Often going unnoticed by the casual fans, Johnston's extraordinary blocking skills provided Smith with the time and space required to secure critical gains. Drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 1989 NFL Draft, Johnston's role as a fullback restricted his personal rushing yard numbers significantly. Over his 11-year NFL career (1989-1999), Johnston accumulated a total of 2,227 rushing yards, with his best season in 1994 amassing 294 rushing yards. Although his numbers may not be as eye-catching as his counterpart's, Johnston's contribution to the Dallas Cowboys' successes must not be underestimated. The two-time Pro Bowl selection (1993, 1994) was integral in paving the way for Smith's record-shattering accomplishments. The Great Divide Comparing the rushing yard figures of the two players reveals a stark difference. Emmitt Smith's career total of 18,355 rushing yards overshadows Daryl Johnston's 2,227 by a whopping 16,128 yards. This immense disparity can be attributed to the distinct roles each player upheld within the team. Smith, as the feature running back, received the lion's share of carries and opportunities to accumulate rushing yards, whereas Johnston sacrificed personal statistics for the betterment of the team, creating running lanes for Smith through gritty, unglamorous work. It is essential not to discount Johnston's impact, but we cannot ignore the staggering difference in rushing yard numbers. Conclusion In conclusion, this in-depth comparison showcases the wide chasm that exists between Emmitt Smith's 18,355 career rushing yards and Daryl Johnston's 2,227. Despite the significant difference, both players contributed in their unique ways to the success of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s. As fans and analysts look back on their storied careers, it is crucial to remember that their roles and contributions created a dynamic partnership that ultimately helped shape the decade's iconic Dallas Cowboys squad."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. What sorts of items does the author tend to store in the garage in containers? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - items that are used very infrequently but are still needed - things that they use every day - not enough information - stuff they intend to give to friends and family","completion":"The author tends to store in the garage, in containers, items that are used very infrequently but are still needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to make logical assumptions, we need to first understand the premise of the available information. Here is a brief explanation of the two events: 1. \\"People are watching a magic show.\\": This statement offers a scenario where an audience is present, and they are watching a magic show, which typically involves a magician or a group of magicians performing tricks and illusions for entertainment purposes. 2. \\"A band is having their live show recorded.\\": This statement presents a situation where a musical group, known as a band, is performing a live show, and this performance is being recorded in some manner, either audio or video (or possibly both). From this understanding, it is apparent that the context of both statements is entirely different; one is related to the performance of magic tricks, while the other is associated with a live music performance. Each event revolves around a distinct type of performer (magicians vs. musicians) and a different form of entertainment (magic vs. music). There is no connection between people watching a magic show and a band having their live show recorded. To assert that there is a link between these two situations would require additional information that demonstrates their relationship, such as: - The events are happening at the same venue where a music performance might precede or follow the magic show. - The magic show event incorporates live music by a band, and this joint performance is being recorded. However, the statement \\"People are watching a magic show.\\" on its own does not provide enough information to establish any connection or lead to the conclusion that \\"A band is having their live show recorded.\\" It would be erroneous to make such an assumption based solely on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Food processors are not the best for mixing small amounts of foods. The wider work bowl of a processor makes it more suitable for larger, bulk processing over the blender. Use your food processor when making larger meals that might involve grating cheese, chopping vegetables or kneading pie crusts. Unlike blenders, food processors have razor sharp blades. A food processor is much more versatile and is suitable for dealing with non-liquid, heavier foods. Pick the type of blade you would like to use, the S blade is best for chopping vegetables, and attach it on the inside of the food processor. You can prep vegetables, and it's also an easy way to chop onions without crying. The food processor will chop, julienne, pulverize, mash, and split foods. Your blender, on the other hand, will probably start smoking if you force it to try to do these things. Attach the grating disc, also called the shredding disc, to the top of the bowl on your food processor. Use this attachment to grate cheese, bread or vegetables. Put nuts without their shells into your food processor when using the grinding blade. The food processor will soon turn the nuts into butter. Pick a food processor that's solid and sturdy if you plan to use it to knead dough. Connect the kneading attachment to knead dough for pie crusts and more.

Read this and answer the question European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines and/or chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can attain a high level of complexity. What method is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches, tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music?","completion":"Composers use the system of staff notation to prescribe to performers the pitches (such as melodies, basslines, and chords), tempo, meter, and rhythms for a piece of music.

Let's break down the sentences to understand the nuances better. Sentence 1: \\"In 1930, it was purchased by American Airlines to become AVCO.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the specific year (1930) when an unnamed company was purchased by American Airlines. The purpose of the acquisition is explicitly mentioned – \\"to become AVCO.\\" It implies that American Airlines bought the company with the primary intention of using it to form or establish a new entity named AVCO. It suggests that the acquisition was strategically planned to create AVCO. Sentence 2: \\"It was acquired by AVCO American Airlines in 1930.\\" This sentence also conveys that an unnamed company was taken over by American Airlines in 1930. However, in this sentence, the acquiring entity is referred to as \\"AVCO American Airlines.\\" It implies that at the time of acquisition, American Airlines was already known as AVCO American Airlines, or it could mean that American Airlines acquired the company on behalf of AVCO. There is no indication in this sentence about American Airlines' intention to create a new entity named AVCO or rebrand the acquired company as AVCO. In summary, both sentences imply that a certain company was acquired by American Airlines in 1930. However, the first sentence emphasizes the purpose of the acquisition - to create or establish AVCO, while the second sentence only states that the company was acquired by AVCO American Airlines, without providing any information about the purpose or strategy behind the acquisition. Ideally, more context is needed to fully understand the situation and the relationship between American Airlines, AVCO, and the acquired company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Ayers went to make a payment toward the 283 balance for her family's Christmas gifts at Walmart, her money was refused. According to a Walmart employee, a woman had paid a part of Ayers' bill after seeing her shopping in the store. The unknown woman also left Ayers a touching note, which left the mother of two in tears. Ayers, whose sons are 11 and 3, says the stranger's great generosity came at the perfect time for her family. Before the anonymous payment was made, Ayers had worried she would not be able to get her kids' toys in time for Christmas. Ayers is still looking for the woman who helped pay for their Christmas gifts for her kids. She took a picture of her receipt with the headline: This stranger paid 4 gifts for us. I wish I could thank her for helping give our kids a Merry Christmas! For thousands of families like Ayers', feeling this financial pressure around Christmastime is nothing new. These families who still have a roof over their heads and food on their tables often slip through the cracks -- they can afford all the necessities, but the \\"extras\\" are harder to come by.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Some Chinese new-rich like eating shark fin soup because they think it shows their class. However, for the Chinese NBA idol Yao Ming, doing so is unacceptable as the practice has led to the overfishing of sharks. When Yao and his wife Ye Li got married in 2007, they publicly announced that they would not allow shark fin soup to be served at their wedding banquet. Actually, Yao had been saying no to shark fins since 2006, when he was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for wild life protection. Now, the 226-cm big guy is resorting to his personal influence to encourage more to say no to eating the soup and to raise awareness of animal protection. \\"Sharks are friends of human beings. They are not our food,\\" Yao said. Other celebrity athletes like Olympic champions Li Ning and Kong Linghui are following on the heels of Yao, throwing themselves into serving the public as Goodwill Ambassadors for wild animal rescue. Recent reports about Yao's retirement have saddened tens of thousands of basketball fans both at home and abroad. Yet Yao's influence goes far beyond the basketball courts. Yao has engaged himself in charity and public welfare services for quite a while. When the devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit Wenchuan in southwest China in 2008, Yao donated 2 million yuan . \\"When I was a little boy, my parents and teachers told me to help others and to be a good man,\\" Yao recalled. \\"But I could not donate then because I had not much pocket money. After I moved to Houston, I got involved in quite a number of community service activities and I felt a strong sense of achievement when I got people together,\\" Yao said. Like Yao, newly crowned French Open champion Li Na has showed her willingness to donate. Li gave 480,000 yuan of her prize money from the open, plus 20,000 yuan from her own pocket, to a local nursing home in her hometown. Another Chinese sports icon, hurdler Liu Xiang, has also been actively involved in charity for years.

A lid is not strictly necessary, though, especially if the jar is fairly tall. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2d/Melt-Honey-Step-1Bullet3.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/2/2d/Melt-Honey-Step-1Bullet3.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Fill a deep saucepan roughly halfway with water. Place this saucepan on the stove over high heat, keeping it there until it reaches a rolling boil. Before boiling the water, make sure that you have enough water in your saucepan to melt the honey. Place the jar inside the saucepan and check the water level. The level of water should approximately match the level of honey inside the jar. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/a/a3/Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} After the water reaches a steady boil, remove it from the stove and set it down on a heat-resistant surface. Alternatively, you can keep the water on the stove and reduce the heat to low. Before placing the jar of honey in the water, though, you need to make sure that all simmering stops. Hot temperatures will not make the honey inedible, but temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) can destroy some of the beneficial health properties of the honey. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/ec/Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Sit the jar of honey directly on the bottom of the pan so that it is now surrounded on all sides by hot water. If you are using a lid, make sure that the lid is on very loose. You want to prevent water from getting inside while allowing air to escape. If you tighten the lid too much, pressure could build up inside of the jar and cause the glass to crack. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/df/Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Periodically remove the lid and stir the honey while the jar is still sitting inside the hot water. This can help the honey melt more evenly and at a quicker pace. Continue doing this until the honey melts. If you are trying to melt crystallized granules out, keep at it until you no longer see any crystals left. If you are trying to melt thick, raw honey, continue melting it in the hot water until it thins to the consistency of store-bought honey. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/c/c5/Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} This process can take a long time depending on how much honey you have.

Tighten the lid on securely and store the honey at room temperature until you are ready to use it. The ideal storage temperature is 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 21 degrees Celsius). At colder temperatures, the honey will begin to crystallize.

I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action.

McCain Looks for a Home-Court Advantage ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Republican John McCain stepped up his assault on Democratic rival Barack Obama as he campaigned energetically in the West, claiming Saturday a home-court edge in crucial battleground states in the region. \\"I'm a fellow Westerner, I understand the issues, I understand the challenges the great Western states face,\\" said McCain, an Arizona senator. \\"We know what our great Southwest is, we welcome it and I'm proud to be a senator from the West.\\" McCain continued to portray Obama -- a senator from Illinois -- as a tax-and-spend liberal certain to push for more government and higher spending, but he added a twist as he stumped through New Mexico and Texas. \\"Sen. Obama has never been south of the border,\\" said McCain, arguing that he has a feel for issues like water that resonate throughout the region. McCain also pointed to the likelihood that Democrats would continue controlling Congress after the election, meaning winning the White House would give the party total control of the government. He warned that a \\"Democratic congressional agenda\\" would become the nation's should Obama win. With polls showing him behind Obama nationally, McCain pledged a scrappy close to the campaign. \\"We're a few points down and the pundits, of course, as they have four or five times, have written us off,\\" he said. \\"We've got them just where we want them. We like being the underdog.\\"McCain swept through New Mexico, with a dip into Texas, looking to reverse polls showing him trailing in states in the Southwest. Later he was to head to Iowa in hopes of putting that state's seven electoral votes in play. Seeking to energize his backers, McCain said Obama was \\"more interested in controlling wealth than creating it.\\" \\"He believes in redistributing wealth,\\" McCain told about 1,500 at an outdoor rally in New Mexico. \\"We've seen that movie before in other countries. That's not America.\\" His challenge was daunting in the campaign's closing days.

Please answer this question: ratio of indian flag in length and breath?","completion":"The Indian flag, also known as the \\"Tiranga\\" or the tricolor, is the pride of the nation and represents the country's unity, integrity, and diversity. The flag's dimensions are carefully outlined in the Flag Code of India. The Indian national flag has a precise ratio of length to breadth, as specified in the Indian National Flag rules and regulation. The ratio is 3:2, which means the length of the national flag must be 1.5 times longer than its breadth. To elaborate, if the flag's breadth (height) is 2 units, then it must have a length or width equal to 3 units. The flag is divided into three horizontal bands of equal size, with the top band being saffron (or kesari), the middle band white, and the bottom band green. At the center of the white band lies a navy blue wheel with 24 spokes, known as the \\"Ashoka Chakra,\\" symbolizing the eternal cycle of time and progress. Every aspect of the Indian flag has been purposefully designed to represent various elements of India's rich historical and cultural background. The saffron color symbolizes strength and courage, the white stands for peace and truth, while the green represents growth and prosperity. The Ashoka Chakra, with its 24 spokes, signifies the hours in a day, representing continuance and the circle of life. The flag's ratio of 3:2 ensures that its design remains proportionate and visually balanced when displayed on occasions such as Republic Day and Independence Day.

His public profile remained low throughout the 1970s, although his name appeared occasionally in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated they had no plans of repackaging Drake's albums, but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. The release compiled the three studio albums, the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974, and an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.By the mid-1980s, Drake was being cited as an influence by musicians such as Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Robert Smith of the Cure; Smith credited the origin of his band's name to a lyric from Drake's song \\"Time Has Told Me\\" (\\"a troubled cure for a troubled mind\\"). Drake gained further exposure in 1985 with the release of the Dream Academy's hit single \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", which included a dedication to Drake on its sleeve. In 1986, a biography of Drake was published in Danish; it was translated, updated with new interviews, and published in English in February 2012. Drake's reputation continued to grow, and by the end of the 1980s, his name was appearing regularly in newspapers and music magazines in the United Kingdom; he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic hero\\".On 20 June 1998, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, Fruit Tree: The Nick Drake Story, featuring interviews with Boyd, Wood, Gabrielle and Molly Drake, Paul Wheeler, Robert Kirby and Ashley Hutchings, and narrated by Danny Thompson. In early 1999, BBC2 aired a 40-minute documentary, A Stranger Among Us—In Search of Nick Drake. The following year, Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens released the documentary A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake, featuring interviews with Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, Wood and Kirby. Later that year, The Guardian placed Bryter Layter number one in its \\"Alternative Top 100 Albums Ever\\" list. In November 2014, Gabrielle published a biography of Drake.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where did Napoleon NOT invade, the Americas or Spain? Context: The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. The answer is:","completion":"To extract the answer to the question, we'll follow these steps: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks us where Napoleon did NOT invade - the Americas or Spain? 2. Examine the context: The context discusses the decolonization of the Americas, the Spanish American wars of independence, and the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. 3. Identify relevant information: The context states that the wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America were \\"directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain.\\" 4.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be a dedicated German spy, and is believed to be disguised among the Yugoslav Partisans as a Captain Lescovar (Franco Nero). Mallory and Miller's new mission is to get to Yogoslavia, find Nicolai, and kill him.To get to Yugoslavia the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit led by Lt. Col. Barnsby (Harrison Ford) and having with its own mission in German-occupied Yugoslavia. To maximize security, Force 10 steals a plane from Termoli Airfield in Italy rather than requisitioning one, but are spotted by US M.Ps before takeoff. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MP's, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli only to be shot down by German night fighters over Yugoslavia. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver and Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.On the ground, the five survivors run across a group they believe to be Communist Yugoslav Partisans, their allies.

The Germans take the team into custody, but do not know what their mission is.

(2) Previously , it was planned that Sergey Sergey Volkov 's position would be filled by Thomas Reiter ( Russia ) before the launch of STS-121 was postponed until July 2006 . Do these two sentences mean the same thing? a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). no. These two sentences may seem similar at first glance, but they convey different meanings. In the first sentence, Thomas Reiter's position was initially planned to be filled by Sergey Volkov, a Russian astronaut, before the launch of STS-121 was postponed until July 2006. This means that Thomas Reiter was eventually able to take his position, and it did not need to be filled by Sergey Volkov due to the postponement. However, in the second sentence, it was initially planned that Sergey Sergey Volkov's position would be filled by Thomas Reiter before the launch of STS-121 was postponed until July 2006. The repeated term \\"Sergey Sergey Volkov\\" can cause confusion, but if we assume it should be \\"Sergey Volkov,\\" then the sentence states that Thomas Reiter was meant to replace Sergey Volkov in his position. The central idea here is that Thomas Reiter would be filling in Sergey Volkov's position, but it does not explicitly state whether he actually ended up doing so. In summary, the first sentence describes a situation where Sergey Volkov was initially planned to replace Thomas Reiter, but the postponement of the launch allowed Thomas Reiter to maintain his position.

This House believes that God exists What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"One could make a detailed and robust argument in favor of the belief that God exists, drawing from various philosophical, moral, cosmological, and experiential perspectives. Here's an extensive exploration of five significant arguments that could be presented in this debate: 1. Cosmological Argument (First Cause): This argument posits that everything that exists must have a cause, and this line of causation must necessarily lead to a first, or uncaused, cause. Since the universe is a vast and complex system of existence, there must be an uncaused cause, or a \\"Prime Mover,\\" responsible for setting everything into motion. This uncaused cause is identified as God, who serves as the originating logic and power for all existence. 2. Teleological Argument (Design Argument): The teleological argument contends that the intricate order, structure, and complexity of the universe are compelling proof of intelligent design. Considering the natural world's interdependent systems, the precise tuning of the universe's physical constants, and the emergence of conscious life, it seems improbable that these phenomena were products of mere chance. Instead, an intelligent designer, i.e., God, is viewed as the most plausible explanation behind the universe's fine-tuned properties, which allow for the development and sustenance of life. 3. Moral Argument: The moral argument suggests that the existence of objective moral values and duties are best explained by the presence of a morally perfect and transcendent being. While moral relativism posits that concepts of right and wrong depend on social, cultural, or personal factors, the moral argument advocates for an absolute moral law that transcends individual perceptions. This ultimate moral authority can only come from an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good creator who imbues human beings with intrinsic worth and moral guidance. 4. Ontological Argument: The ontological argument is a philosophical position that asserts that the very concept of God as the maximally perfect being necessitates God's existence. Based on the premise that existence is a greater quality than non-existence, it follows that, since God is defined as the greatest conceivable being, God must possess the property of existence. To deny the existence of such a perfect being would be logically contradictory, as it implies that there could be something greater than the greatest conceivable being. 5. Religious Experiences and Intuitions: This argument acknowledges the countless reports of personal religious experiences and intuitions from individuals of various cultures and religious backgrounds. From divine revelations to mystical experiences, these subjective encounters could be seen as evidence of a higher power at work in human lives. While critics might dismiss religious experiences as delusions or wishful thinking, the cumulative weight of these experiences throughout history consistently points to something transcendent and suggests that God's existence is manifest in people's lives. In conclusion, the belief in God's existence can be debated and substantiated using a combination of cosmological, teleological, moral, ontological, and experiential arguments. When examined collectively, these perspectives provide a multifaceted and compelling case for the reality of a transcendent, divine being underlying the very fabric of the universe and shaping human understanding of morality, purpose, and existence itself."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What is the last name of the person whose refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music? Answer the above question based on the context below: Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and...

Question: What is the opinion of the author regarding regions of DNA that serve no obvious function? Context: Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.

Movie title: Mission: Impossible III Movie plot: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from being an IMF team leader, instead opting for a quiet life with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), a hospital nurse (who was the captive in the opening sequence). During their engagement party, Ethan is contacted by IMF Operations Director Musgrave (Billy Crudup) who provides him with a disposable camera. After viewing a video hidden in the camera, he finds out Musgrave wants him to rescue Agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), Ethan's protégé, who has been captured in Berlin by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a prominent dealer in the international black market (the captor from the opening). He reluctantly agrees to participate in the mission and meets the team which has been selected for him, consisting of Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), Zhen (Maggie Q), and his old partner, Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames).The team assaults an enemy stronghold in Berlin and extracts Agent Farris successfully, but she dies during their escape when an explosive capsule placed inside her head detonates. After Lindsey's funeral, Ethan is notified of a \\"package\\" sent to him by Lindsey, and discovers that it is a microdot hidden under the stamp in a blank postcard. Ethan discusses its possible importance with Luther and both decide to keep its existence a secret.Using information recovered from a laptop in the Berlin mission, Ethan then decides to go after Davian himself, targeting him at a meeting in Vatican City, where a lucrative transaction involving a mysterious object, codenamed \\"The Rabbit's Foot\\", is apparently taking place. Neither of Ethan's superiors, directors Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) or Musgrave, has authorized the mission. Before leaving, Ethan reassures Julia of their relationship, and promptly marries her at the hospital in a small ceremony.

Answer:","completion":"In Mission: Impossible III, Ethan Hunt uses a tracking device and his team's skills to find and rescue Julia, his fiancée. After their wedding ceremony at the hospital, Ethan and his team head to Rome, where they successfully abduct the villain Owen Davian. However, during their attempted flight back to the U.S., Davian's men manage to intercept and attack the plane, ultimately leading to Davian's escape. In retaliation, Davian captures Julia as leverage to force Ethan to retrieve the mysterious object known as \\"The Rabbit's Foot.\\" To find Julia, Ethan first needs to secure the Rabbit's Foot. He and his team infiltrate the Shanghai building where it is located, successfully acquiring the object in a daring heist. Next, Ethan negotiates with Davian to make an exchange: the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's location and her safe release. To determine Julia's precise location, Ethan plants a tracking device on the disposable cell phone he is given to communicate with Davian. When Davian calls with further instructions about the exchange site, the tracking device picks up the signal and allows Ethan's team to trace it back to its origin. This leads them to a warehouse where Julia is being held captive. In the end, it is a combination of a tracking device, tactical strategy, and the skills of his team members that enable Ethan to successfully find and rescue Julia from the clutches of Owen Davian. Considering whether to invest in this film proposal would depend on various factors such as the potential for commercial success, the appeal of the storyline, the presence of well-known actors, and the target demographic.

A: A:","completion":"The structures of the cardiovascular system that help regulate body processes by either constricting or dilating are blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules. These blood vessels play a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure, blood flow, and the distribution of blood throughout the body. Step 1: Blood vessels regulate blood flow Blood vessels can constrict or dilate to regulate blood flow. This is essential for maintaining proper blood pressure and ensuring that oxygen, nutrients, and waste products are adequately distributed throughout the body. Step 2: Arteries and arterioles Arteries and arterioles are responsible for carrying oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. They have muscular walls that can contract or relax, allowing them to regulate blood pressure and blood flow to different tissues. Step 3: Veins and venules Veins and venules return oxygen-poor blood to the heart. They also have the ability to constrict or dilate, which helps to regulate blood pressure and blood flow back to the heart. Step 4: Smooth muscle layers The walls of arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules are composed of layers of smooth muscle. The contraction and relaxation of these smooth muscle layers is influenced by neuronal input, hormones, and local factors, which in turn helps to regulate the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Step 5: Endothelial cells Blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which produce substances such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelin-1. These substances influence the contraction and relaxation of the surrounding smooth muscle layers, thereby regulating the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Step 6: Autoregulation in tissues Some body tissues have the ability to autoregulate blood flow by altering the resistance of their arterioles in response to changes in tissue needs. This allows for adjustments in blood flow to ensure that the tissue receives an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. In summary, the blood vessels in the cardiovascular system, comprised of arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules, along with their smooth muscle layers and endothelial cells, help regulate body processes by constricting or dilating to control blood flow and pressure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: What term is used to describe major changes in the genetic material? A: Answer:","completion":"The term \\"Chromosomal Alterations\\" is used to describe major changes in the genetic material. These alterations are significant adjustments to the structure and organization of chromosomes, which contain the genetic information in the form of DNA sequences. Chromosomes play a vital role in the transmission of hereditary traits during cell division and reproduction. Chromosomal alterations can result from several mechanisms such as deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. These changes can have a wide range of effects on the organism, depending on the type and extent of the alteration. 1. Deletions: These occur when a portion of the chromosomal material is lost or removed. This can lead to a loss of essential genes or disruptions in the regulation of gene expression, causing various physiological and developmental disorders. 2. Duplications: This involves the addition of extra copies of genetic material, which may lead to an increase in gene expression or the emergence of new functions for these duplicated genes. Duplications can provide novel genetic resources for evolution and adaptation but may also lead to genetic disorders if the increase in gene dosage disturbs normal cellular functions. 3. Inversions: An inversion occurs when a chromosome segment breaks and then reattaches in the reverse orientation. This rearrangement can disrupt gene function by altering gene order or changing the regulation of gene expression. In some cases, inversions can lead to the formation of new genes with novel functions, contributing to evolution and adaptation. 4. Translocations: This type of chromosomal alteration involves the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes. Translocations can result in the fusion of two different genes, creating a new hybrid gene with potentially altered functions. Translocations can have significant effects on the phenotype of an organism, contributing to genetic diversity and speciation, or causing genetic disorders depending on the specific genes involved. Chromosomal alterations play a critical role in shaping the genetic diversity and evolutionary adaptation of species. However, they can also have negative consequences if they disrupt essential genes or regulatory elements, leading to genetic disorders and other health conditions. Studying chromosomal alterations helps researchers gain a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of various genetic diseases and disorders, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions and advancing our knowledge of the principles governing genetic inheritance and evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: - still new - In need of renovations - An historical landmark - not enough information Answer:","completion":"An historical landmark"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. and a hint : Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

While the buyers and cities may change, the narrator does not. Episode after episode, Dunker introduces us to a new couple and a new location but with the same singsong intonation and honeyed tone. She is the show. Yet, she hasn’t been seen on camera on the network, not even once. On a channel brimming with handsome homebuilders and homespun husband-and-wife property stars, the woman who gives voice to some of the network’s most popular and obsessively watched shows stands apart; unlike the others, she is heard but not seen, HGTV’s most famous unfamous person. “I’ve remained in the shadows,” Dunker told BuzzFeed News. “The conventional wisdom for voiceover actors is you are kind of heard and not seen. It’s just kind of the way it’s always been.” And she’s never given an extensive interview before — until now. “The network has preferred to keep me in a little bit of mystery because that’s just worked out, but now it’s kinda different,” she said. From just 26 episodes in the 1999 first season, the House Hunters franchise has exploded into a cult pop culture phenomenon, airing an astonishing 447 episodes in 2015 across a seemingly endless list of spinoffs: House Hunters International, Tiny House Hunters, House Hunters Renovation, House Hunters Off the Grid, House Hunters: Where Are They Now?, to name but a few. “My first year [in 2009], we did not know there would be so many shows and spinoffs,” Dunker said. “There was only just House Hunters and House Hunters International at that time, and not every day like how it is now. There have been like 10 spinoffs now. So I had no idea it was going to explode into this much work.” All the shows are unashamedly formulaic — but hey, the formula works: One property-hunting (hopefully slightly annoying) couple with completely opposing views of what they’re each after; a local real-estate agent who must show abundant patience; three house tours, including a “budget-buster” and a fixer-upper for good measure (“This house is too tiny!” someone on Tiny House Hunters will inevitably proclaim); and a walk-on-the-beach finale where a choice is eventually made. Watching on the couch with friends and wine invariably involves guessing amongst one another which house will be chosen, and then screaming at the television when a couple makes the “wrong” decision. It’s real estate porn, for sure, but the real fun is in the parade of characters searching for homes: the married couple moving for work, where one person is silently less than thrilled to be making the shift; the lonesome student decamping for college, for whom the producers have had to rustle up some other expat and pretend that they’re awkward friends; and, of course, the people with quirky jobs but inexplicably bountiful budgets — a trend so inherently ridiculous, it last month spawned a meme. [House Hunters episode] HUSBAND: I'm a freelance hamster trainer WIFE: And I tune harmonicas part-time HUSBAND: Our budget is 950K Andromeda Dunker was born at Yale University in Connecticut, where her father, a respected biophysicist, was completing postgraduate studies. Her unique first name comes thanks to her Chinese-American mother, an astrophysicist who named her daughter for the Andromeda galaxy. “That was entirely my wife’s idea,” her father, A. Keith Dunker, now an emeritus professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, told BuzzFeed News of the name. “I thought, Why not? It sounds like a great name.” When Dunker was 11, the family moved to France for a time while her father worked in nuclear research. It was there where she became fluent in French, in addition to the Chinese and English she spoke at home. Dunker started college in Oregon when she was just 15 to study linguistics, picking up Russian along the way. (She now puts her polyglot skills to use by ensuring she correctly pronounces the names of the foreign cities on House Hunters International). After deciding she wanted a career in entertainment rather than linguistics, Dunker pursued a drama major in Seattle and began booking work in the Washington area. During one audition, a casting director suggested she tell her agent to start putting her forward for voiceover work. “In my head, growing up, my voice sounded annoying and nasally,” she said. “The first time I heard it in a microphone I was like, Oh, wow. That sounds kind of nice!” In 2009, while out driving with friends during a visit to Portland, Dunker got a call from her agent, asking her to quickly send along a recording of her reading a script for a reality show. They needed the audition within five minutes. “So we raced back to my friend’s house,” Dunker recalled. “I sat in my goddaughter’s room with a Hello Kitty blanket over my head and I recorded this House Hunters script audition really quickly and sent it in. So I almost missed it. It just goes to show you have to audition for everything that comes your way. It’s feast or famine in this career.” Dunker’s father recalled visiting Los Angeles with his wife a few years back when he realized his daughter had landed a plum job in the notoriously difficult entertainment industry. “For the first time ever, my daughter paid for dinner!” he said. “So I should have realized something was up.” Dunker is, in fact, the third narrator in the show’s 18-year history, after Suzanne Whang and Colette Whitaker. Whang actually served as the on-camera host for many years, before the show switched to the off-camera narrator format used today. “Part of my job is to be in the background,” Dunker said. “I’m not really with you, but I am leading you through this journey as a narrator. That’s kind of how I see it. If I were to come out more as a personality of my own, then it kind of breaks it. I’m not sure it would work as well.” Dunker now voices anywhere between 10 to 20 episodes of House Hunters each week, on top of auditions and other jobs. She records the House Hunters International episodes in a home studio, because that show’s production company, Leopard USA, is based in New York. For all the other episodes, she travels down the road to the office of Pie Town Productions from the Hollywood home she shares with husband Joshua Sliwa, a photographer and meditation instructor, and their two dogs, Sadie and Chloe. “Over the years I think the narration has changed,” Dunker said. “If people look at House Hunters International from the first season I was on it, it’s a lot more dramatic, and now it’s become more conversational. And that’s just an evolution of the show, I think. It’s been on for so long it evolves with the style of the time,” she said. Like any good reality show, House Hunters is, of course, partly a fantasy. A few years back, former participants began opening up online about their experiences on the show, with some revealing they were selected only after they had closed on a property or had their “story” embellished by producers to make it more interesting. “To maximize production time, we seek out families who are pretty far along in the process,\\" Brian Balthazar, the network’s then–director of programming and development, conceded to Today.com. \\"Often everything moves much more quickly than we can anticipate, so we go back and revisit some of the homes that the family has already seen and we capture their authentic reactions.” Dunker defended the program for being as genuine as a half-hour reality show about buying a property can be. “It’s not a five-hour documentary following them to see 25 houses. We can only show so much,” she said. “People who are shocked like this are not familiar with production at all. You can’t just follow a couple around for 10 years while they look for a house.” For Dunker, the show’s success lies in its simple “Goldilocks formula, where you see three houses and this one’s too big, this one’s too small, and this one’s just right.” But she acknowledges that in addition to people’s genuine interest in real estate and travel, there is also a “tongue-in-cheek fandom where people just want to make fun of the contributors.” “We get so angry at these people,” she says of the house hunters. “They seem like such idiots or jerks, but they’re not actors. They’re real people. They’re on camera, they’re probably nervous. This guy sounds like he’s being a jerk to his wife or vice versa, but maybe he’s perfectly lovely and he’s just nervous and trying to make some joke.” She’s also proud of the “cross section” of people featured on the show. “Some of them are richer, some of them are less rich, but the cross section is all races, all genders, gay and straight,” she says. Dunker is incredibly friendly and warm, but unlike other creatures of Hollywood she professes to being very uncomfortable with self-promotion and says she’s terrified at speaking to her first reporter. She only recently created an Instagram account, which she updates hesitantly with photos of her dogs and homemade quilts — an activity she discovered helps calm her after hours of exhausting speaking every day. Asked to describe her voice, Dunker groans in embarrassment. She prefers to share what others have said: “A lot of people have told me that they watch it in the background or at night and it lulls them to sleep ... I’ve had a lot of people tell me that I’m tucking them in at night or that I’m giving them a big hug.” “As an actor, especially as a commercial actor, it’s hard sometimes to justify your job as being very meaningful,\\" she said. \\"My dad is this world-class scientist. He’s doing very important work. A lot of times, if I’m just doing a commercial for a fast-food chain or something, I’ve wondered in the past what I’m contributing to society. But with House Hunters, people seem to like it so much and it makes them happy and makes them soothed or go to sleep or whatever. That feels good. It feels like it’s useful.” David Mack is a reporter and weekend editor for BuzzFeed News in New York. Contact David Mack at david.mack@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip?

Which language is this?","completion":"This text is in Finnish language. It translates to, \\"Explain to me, what is mass deportation, which is forbidden.\\" I will provide a detailed answer about mass deportation in English. Mass deportation refers to the forced removal or relocation of large groups of individuals, commonly based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, or political affiliations, from their homes or communities to another location, usually a foreign country or distant locations within the same country. This action is often carried out by governments or state authorities for various reasons such as conflict resolution, population control, or removing perceived threats to the ruling regime. The process of mass deportation usually involves the use of force or coercion, as the victims are often unwilling to leave their homes, families, and communities. This often leads to numerous violations of basic human rights, including the rights to life, security, freedom of movement, and protection from torture or inhuman treatment. Mass deportations have occurred throughout human history, most notably during the 20th century. Some of the most infamous examples of mass deportations include: 1. The Holocaust: The systematic deportation of Jews and other persecuted groups to concentration and extermination camps by Nazi Germany. 2. The Armenian Genocide: Forced deportation of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire to the Syrian desert during World War I. 3. The Forced Deportations under Stalin: Millions of people were deported to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union as part of forced population transfers, collective punishment, or ethnic cleansing. 4. The Trail of Tears: The forced relocation of Native American tribes in the United States during the 19th century, resulting in thousands of deaths due to exposure and starvation. Considering the grave human rights violations and the immense suffering caused by mass deportations, the practice is considered to be illegal under international law. Various conventions and legal instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, prohibit the arbitrary deportation or forced return of individuals to countries where they may face persecution or threats to their life and physical integrity. Furthermore, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court identifies mass deportation as a crime against humanity, punishable by law. It states that \\"deportation or forcible transfer of population\\" is a crime against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population. To summarize, mass deportation refers to the forced relocation of large groups of people, often based on their ethnicity, religion, nationality, or political affiliation. This practice has caused immense human suffering throughout history and is considered illegal under international law due to the severe human rights violations it entails."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Premise: oh that's interesting but but no concept for wanting to be private Hypothesis: Having a secret child isn't a concept for privacy. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between the concepts and ideas presented in both statements. Premise: \\"oh that's interesting but no concept for wanting to be private\\" The premise suggests that the concept of wanting to be private does not exist or is not considered in a certain situation. However, it does not provide specific details about the situation or context in which this statement is applied. Hypothesis: \\"Having a secret child isn't a concept for privacy.\\" The hypothesis introduces a specific context - having a secret child - and negates the relationship between this situation and the concept of privacy. It implies that keeping a child a secret is not considered an act of privacy. Now, let's analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. First, both statements discuss the concept of privacy, albeit in different contexts. The premise argues that there is no demand for privacy, whereas the hypothesis claims that having a secret child is not an example of privacy-seeking behavior. Here, the hypothesis seems to provide an instance that might align with the premise. However, the relationship between the hypothesis and the premise is not definitively conclusive. The premise does not directly imply that having a secret child automatically fits the context where privacy is not desired. There is no explicit mention of \\"having a secret child\\" in the premise, which makes it hard to conclude that the hypothesis is supported solely by the premise. Moreover, each statement can be interpreted in multiple ways. The premise could be interpreted to mean that in a particular context, the individuals involved have no interest in maintaining privacy. Alternatively, it may hint that there is no possibility for privacy in that scenario. The hypothesis could be understood to mean that having a secret child is not perceived as seeking privacy or that it is unrelated to the fundamental idea of privacy. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Although the hypothesis provides an example of a situation that may agree with the general idea presented in the premise, the connection between the two statements is weak and indirect. The lack of specific context and details within the premise makes it challenging to determine a direct, conclusive relationship of entailment with the presented hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The surviving children, who were mostly living in relief centres, performed ceremonies marking the special day, but also acknowledging the earthquake.\\" Answer:","completion":"The context given is about the aftermath of an earthquake where parents were mourning for their children, and surviving children were acknowledging the natural disaster during Children's Day ceremonies. The plates under the ground and oceans played a significant part in this situation because they are directly responsible for the occurrence of earthquakes. The Earth's crust is made up of several large tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. These plates are constantly moving, and their movements can cause the Earth's crust to shift. When two plates collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, stress is created along their boundaries. This stress can build up over time and eventually be released in the form of an earthquake. In the context of the tragic event mentioned, the movement of these tectonic plates and the resulting release of stress along their boundaries led to the earthquake that caused the destruction of schools and the loss of many young lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I was the best in most of my classes, but PE class was my nightmare and made me feel that I was not as good as the others. Miss Forsythe was our PE teacher. She was young and energetic. Everyone liked her. She said that we all had to come to her classes. No one could hide from Miss Forsythe! One day she told me that she wanted me to play a game with another girl in a PE show. I was rather worried that I wouldn't do a good job when she explained her idea, but she was excited. With her encouragement, I had no choice but to agree. It was a \\"boy meets girl\\" game. I played the boy and my classmate, Margaret Ann, played the girl. We were dressed in evening clothes and danced around the floor. According to Miss Forsythe, I had to pick up Margaret Ann when we finished the dance. Since I was not strong enough to pick the tallest girl up, it was she who picked me up. I suddenly felt ten feet tall! It was a huge success and everybody applauded for our excellent performance. What a wonderful ending! Afterwards, I smiled confidently .

Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets.

A New York man accused of hurling homophobic slurs at a gay man on the street before shooting him dead laughed and boasted about the alleged murder to police as he was being handcuffed just minutes afterwards, according to prosecutors. Elliot Morales, 33, has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in the shooting death of Mark Carson, 32, just after midnight on Saturday. The Greenwich Village resident rolled around 'laughing on the ground' and proudly told officers 'yeah, I shot him in the head' as he was arrested five blocks away from where Carson was killed, the Manhattan Criminal Court heard on Sunday. Suspect: Elliot Morales, 33, pictured, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in a Manhattan court on Sunday. Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Morales was ordered held without bail pending another court appearance on Thursday. His attorney, Reginald Sharpe, could not be reached for comment. On Saturday, minutes before opening fire in the lively Village streets, police say Morales followed Carson and his companion and asked them 'Are you afraid? Do you watch the news? Do you know what happened in Sandy Hook?' according to the New York Post. He then asked Carson, 'Do you want to die here,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Police said Morales called Carson a 'f*****' and a 'queer' before shooting him in the cheek in a neighborhood long known as a bedrock of the gay rights movement. Didn't back down: Mark Carson, 32, refused to shy away from his gay identity, even when confronted by a biggot who was harassing him in the street. Morales was soon arrested a few blocks away. He has six previous arrests including. one for attempted murder in 1998, police said. Details of that arrest. weren't immediately clear. He served nine years in city and state. prisons, The Post reported. Saturday's shooting scene is a few. blocks from the Stonewall Inn, the site of 1969 riots that helped give. rise to gay rights when patrons reacted to police harassment. The violence follows a spate of. recent bias attacks on gay men in New York, but this was the first. deadly one. Kelly said police were looking into possible links between. the incidents. The shooting stunned a city where, in. many neighborhoods, same-sex couples now walk freely holding hands. It. also comes at a time when the gay marriage movement is gaining momentum. in many parts of the United States. Twelve states have legalized. same-sex marriage, including New York in 2011. Crime scene: Police say Morales randomly shot Carson on Sixth Avenue, pictured, after having words with him only because Carson was homosexual. Point-blank: Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Carson was revealed on Sunday as a. 'courageous' gay man who never hid his sexuality - despite being. subjected to anti-gay slurs for years. Before the gay-bashing assailant. killed the 32-year-old, he asked whether his companion was his. boyfriend. Carson didn't hesitate and told the man yes, according to. reports. Carson and his best friend of 15 years turned to walk away, but Morales followed them, the New York Post reported. After asking him if he wanted to die there, Morales demanded to know: 'Is he your boy?' When Carson responded 'Yes,' Morales allegedly pulled out the pistol and shot Carson once at point-blank range. He was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where he died. 'He was a courageous person,' Michael Bumpars, Carson's brother, told the New York Daily News. 'My brother was a beautiful person... He was our foundation.' 'Courageous': Carson's family said he had been battered with anti-gay slurs before, but always responded 'with grace' Police on Saturday said the attack was motivated by hate. 'This clearly looks to be a hate crime,' Kelly said. Kelly says the gunman was seen urinating on the street outside a bar. He. says the man went into the bar, made anti-gay remarks to the bartender. and showed the bartender that he was wearing a holster with a silver. pistol. Kelly says the gunman then confronted the victim and a companion on the street and asked if they were 'gay wrestlers.' 'There. was no words that would aggravate the situation spoken by the victims. here. They were confronted,' Kelly said. 'They did not know the. perpetrators, no previous relationship.' Carson lived in Brooklyn and managed a frozen yogurt shop in the West Village. He and his partner were going out for the night in Greenwich Village - a popular area for straight and gay revelers alike. In custody: A man was taken into custody within minutes of the shooting West 8th Street and Sixth Avenue. After the shooting, the gunman ran five blocks before cops captured him at West Third Street and MacDougal Street, on the edge of the NYU campus. The busy and well-traveled intersection of 8th Street, Sixth Avenue and Greenwich Avenue is just a few blocks from Washington Square Park. The shooter was crazed and confessed the shooting to cops when he was collared. Detectives are testing his blood to determine he was on drugs at the time. Another two men who were with Morales when he first confronted Carson were questioned by police and released. Openly gay New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime. 'I am horrified to learn that last night, a gay man was murdered in my district after being chased out of a Greenwich Village restaurant and assailed by homophobic slurs,' she said in a statement. West Village: A normally peaceful and progressive part of Manhattan.This is the fourth hate crime incident in two weeks in the city. 'I stand with all New Yorkers in condemning this attack.' This is the fourth such hate crime that targeted a gay man in the last two weeks in Manhattan. 'There was a time in New York City when hate crimes were a common occurrence,' she added. 'There was a time in New York City when two people of the same gender could not walk down the street arm-in-arm without fear of violence and harassment. We refuse to go back to that time. This kind of shocking and senseless violence, so deeply rooted in hate, has no place in a City whose greatest strength will always be its diversity.' On May 10, police said a gay couple was attacked on West 32nd Street and beaten so severely that one of the men needed eye surgery. Days earlier, another gay couple was assaulted by a group of men in the same area near Madison Square Garden.","completion":"A homophobic hate crime in New York's Greenwich Village resulted in the tragic murder of Mark Carson, a 32-year-old openly gay man.

Process: - Particles in the environment interact with rocks - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces - Question: suppose the oil fields dry up happens, how will it affect less particles hit rocks. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less Step 1: Identify the relationship between oil fields and particles in the environment Oil fields are a source of both liquid (crude oil) and gaseous (natural gas) hydrocarbons. When these hydrocarbons are extracted and processed, they are often burned, which releases particles into the environment. Step 2: Consider the consequences of oil fields drying up If the oil fields dry up, it means that both crude oil and natural gas will become less available and less abundant. This will lead to a reduction in the burning of hydrocarbons, which in turn will reduce the number of particles released into the environment. Step 3: Analyze the effect on particles hitting rocks Given that there will be fewer particles in the environment, there will be fewer particles available to interact with rocks. Consequently, the number of particles hitting, brushing against, or growing against the rocks will decrease. Step 4: Conclude that there will be less particle interaction with rocks Since fewer particles will be present in the environment due to the drying up of oil fields, there will be fewer opportunities for those particles to interact with rocks. As a result, less particles will hit rocks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Boston and New England\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which officials knew there was a highjacker aboard\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Boston and New England\\" correctly answers the question, because the paragraph states that \\"at least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said 'we have some planes.'\\" So, these officials knew there was a hijacker aboard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical health. Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Come up with a temporary title to serve as a placeholder while you're working on your fanfiction. Don't overthink it: anything will do as a working title, as you will be changing it when or before you complete the story. Working titles can round out the presentation of your story while you deal with the writing process, giving you something to look at other than a nagging blank at the top of the page. It can be helpful to choose a working title that deals with some central idea, character, event or motif in your fanfiction. These are some of the factors you'll be considering when finalizing your title, so having a fundamental concept of what label describes your story can prevent you from having to concoct one out of the blue later on. Improvising a working title has the beneficial creative effect of forcing the writer to distill what is important about the story to them into a single word or phrase. Your reader will likely also be a fan of the work your fanfiction is based on, so strive to present to them something fresh while staying in the vein of your source material. Fanfiction will be somewhat exclusive to certain readers by nature, but keep your work accessible by selecting a title that will interest even non-fans. Titillate fans of the material you're calling on with specific references. Using the names of well-known characters or other details from the source material as part of your title (e.g. \\"Murphy's Bargain\\" or \\"Journey to Kyrandia\\") will excite fans while also giving them a sense of what to expect from your story. Your fanfiction is about something. It is set somewhere. It features certain characters. Any of these can be a jumping-off point for finding just the right title. Your story has something to say, so your title should say something about your story. Use the inventory of details you've drawn on to craft your fanfiction to single out one idea or set of ideas that is arresting enough to carry the weight of your story. Since fanfiction takes creative license with other, established works, highlight the originality of your story by using one of your own fictional inventions as part of your title. Though you can get away with it when naming a novel or short story, don't get too abstract with the title of your fanfiction. Your title should be explicit enough to inform the reader of the type of fanfiction it is but also offer some concrete new image. Don't bore your reader or leave them guessing with a vaguely-written title. The name of your fanfiction, like your writing, should be full of dynamic, active language that evokes a response in the reader and moves them to read your work. A title like \\"Man the Cannons\\" is more effective than one like \\"The Great Sea Battle\\" because it is indicative of action. Remember to keep your title consistent with the type of fanfiction you're writing. For instance, a story about Dr. Who might simply be titled \\"Dr. Who: A Case of Star Sickness,\\" while a fanfiction about Indiana Jones would want to retain the formatting of the titles of the source material; \\"Indiana Jones and the Emerald of Skull Island.\\" Unless you have a certain idea that you're resolved to use as your title, play around with multiple titles. Titles are like dates: it's unlikely you'll find \\"the one\\" until you've been through a few that didn't work out. Experiment with different styles and modes of presentation for your title, and get creative. Once you have a short list of potential winners, you can pare them down from there. Ernest Hemingway came up with two defunct titles, \\"The World's Room\\" and \\"They Who Get Shot\\" before settling on \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" Had he not, the book's final title might have been some reworking of the original and been far less memorable. This is the cardinal rule of writing fiction. Since the title is what sells your story, you want to ensure that the name you've given it isn't derivative or a rehash of something else. The most memorable titles are the ones that don't follow formulas. Be bold when naming your fanfiction and try to give it a unique spin that makes readers take notice. Avoid cliches. Many titles take a safe but uninteresting template approach (e.g. \\"The Legend of...\\") and get lost in the sea of nearly identical titles. Your title should be something catchy and repeatable that doesn't sound too much like something your reader has heard time and time again. Resist the urge to turn your title into a pun. It can be tempting, but it's never as clever as you think it is. At best, a pun title draws the reader's attention to it and away from the meaning of the story; at worst, it can be instantly offputting.","completion":"The article provides tips on creating a temporary title for fanfiction to guide the writing process, emphasizing the importance of using original, dynamic language and avoiding cliches while staying true to the source material for an appealing and catchy title."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A health care worker removes another's protective glove as they train at the Palomar Medical Center during a decontamination drill in Escondido, California October 17, 2014. (Reuters Health) - Florescent lotion and black light revealed that health care workers often contaminate their skin and clothing while removing their protective gear, researchers say. This contamination can spread germs and place the health care workers at risk for infection, the authors write in JAMA Internal Medicine. “It was surprising for the participants in the study to see that they frequently contaminated themselves during (personal protective equipment) removal,” said senior author Dr. Curtis J. Donskey of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. “Most of the participants appeared to be unaware of the high risk for contamination and many reported receiving minimal or no training in putting on and taking off (personal protective equipment),” he told Reuters Health by email. Contaminated personnel can also spread pathogens to other susceptible patients. The researchers recruited doctors, nurses and other health care personnel such as phlebotomists and physical therapists at four Cleveland-area hospitals to participate in the simulations. More than half of the 435 simulations were performed by nurses. The participants put on protective gowns and gloves in their usual manner and then had a small amount of fluorescent lotion placed in the palm of their hands, which they then rubbed between their hands for 15 seconds to simulate dirtied gloves, then smeared the gloves over the chest and abdomen area of the gown. Then the gloves were exchanged for clean ones. After they removed their gloves and gowns in their usual manners, researchers used a black light to check for lotion contamination of the hands, forearms, neck, face, hair or clothing. Skin or clothing contamination happened 46 percent of the time, more frequently during glove removal. Researchers also noted whether participants had used proper protective equipment technique, e.g., wearing gloves extended over the wrists of the gown, gown removed first by pulling away from the neck and body, and gloves removed second. Contamination happened 70 percent of the time when proper technique was not followed, compared to 30 percent of the time when it was followed. “When dealing with pathogens that are potentially fatal, the goal has to be zero contamination,” Donskey said. “In routine care settings, we would like personnel to be well trained and confident that they can minimize contamination, but would not insist on zero contamination.” It is important for personnel to perform hand hygiene after removing gloves and gowns since contamination could have happened, he said. The researchers also conducted these tests with a group of personnel who had attended special infection control sessions, with a 10-minute video presentation and 20 minutes of demonstrations and practice in using and removing protective gear. Before the training sessions, these individuals contaminated themselves 60 percent of the time, compared to almost 19 percent after the sessions. The improvements were still seen at re-tests done one and three months later. “This suggests that training using fluorescent lotion can be useful to identify minor deficiencies in technique that lead to contamination,” Donskey said. Recent experience with the Ebola virus in the U.S. demonstrated that self-contamination during removal of protective equipment does occur, but this study exposes a more widespread issue that may be happening during routine patient care, said Dr. Michelle Doll of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond who coauthored a commentary on the new study. “Use of gowns and gloves for contact precautions on a busy inpatient unit is costly on multiple levels,” Doll told Reuters Health by email. “In situations when we do decide to use these tools (for infection prevention, we need to optimize techniques to achieve the best efficacy possible. Otherwise it is wasteful of healthcare worker efforts and hospital resources.” The sight of fluorescent dye on one’s face and hands would be a powerful and lasting lesson, she said. “Being able to see where contamination occurs allows personnel to make adjustments in their technique,” Donskey said. “Because training alone did not result in zero contamination, there is a need for other approaches such as improving (equipment) design or disinfection of (equipment) prior to removal.” SOURCES: bit.ly/1NBRjqz and bit.ly/1jklyFS JAMA Internal Medicine, online October 12, 2015. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Objectives To determine the frequency and sites of contamination on the skin and clothing of personnel during PPE removal and to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the frequency of contamination. Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a point-prevalence study and quasi-experimental intervention from October 28, 2014, through March 31, 2015. Data analysis began November 17, 2014, and ended April 21, 2015. Participants included a convenience sample of health care personnel from 4 Northeast Ohio hospitals who conducted simulations of contaminated PPE removal using fluorescent lotion and a cohort of health care personnel from 7 study units in 1 medical center that participated in a quasi-experimental intervention that included education and practice in removal of contaminated PPE with immediate visual feedback based on fluorescent lotion contamination of skin and clothing. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were the frequency and sites of contamination on skin and clothing of personnel after removal of contaminated gloves or gowns at baseline vs after the intervention. A secondary end point focused on the correlation between contamination of skin with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2, a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus. Results Of 435 glove and gown removal simulations, contamination of skin or clothing with fluorescent lotion occurred in 200 (46.0%), with a similar frequency of contamination among the 4 hospitals (range, 42.5%-50.3%). Contamination occurred more frequently during removal of contaminated gloves than gowns (52.9% vs 37.8%, P = .002) and when lapses in technique were observed vs not observed (70.3% vs 30.0%, P < .001). The intervention resulted in a reduction in skin and clothing contamination during glove and gown removal (60.0% before the intervention vs 18.9% after, P < .001) that was sustained after 1 and 3 months (12.0% at both time points, P < .001 compared with before the intervention). During simulations of contaminated glove removal, the frequency of skin contamination was similar with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2 (58.0% vs 52.0%, P = .45). Conclusions and Relevance Contamination of the skin and clothing of health care personnel occurs frequently during removal of contaminated gloves or gowns. Educational interventions that include practice with immediate visual feedback on skin and clothing contamination can significantly reduce the risk of contamination during removal of PPE. ||||| MONDAY, Oct. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Health care workers often contaminate their skin and clothing when they remove their medical gowns and gloves, new research suggests. For the study, workers at four Ohio hospitals simulated gown and glove removal. Additional health care workers from a separate facility participated in a program that included education and practice of removing contaminated gowns and gloves. The health care workers simulated 435 gown and glove removals. The researchers used a fluorescent lotion to determine \\"contamination.\\" Skin or clothing got contaminated 46 percent of the time, the investigators found. But, the education and practice program led to a significant drop in the contamination rate -- from 60 percent to about 19 percent, the findings showed. This improvement lasted even when health care workers were retested after one and three months, Dr. Curtis Donskey, of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and colleagues reported in the study published in the Oct. 12 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine. The study findings highlight the urgent need to come up with ways to reduce the risk of contamination, Donskey said in a journal news release. It's also important to figure out better ways to train people in how to best remove these items, Donskey's team said. And, ideally, the design of protective clothing should be improved to reduce the risk of contamination, the study authors suggested. More information The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about job safety for health care workers. ||||| Summary:","completion":"According to a new study featured in JAMA Internal Medicine, healthcare workers often contaminate their skin and clothing while removing their protective gear, which could pose a risk of infection for both the worker themselves as well as patients. The researchers engaged doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel from four hospitals to simulate gown and glove removal. They were given small amounts of fluorescent lotion to imitate germs, and once the gloves and gowns were removed, the researchers used blacklight to check for contamination. The results showed that contamination occurred 46% of the time, mostly during glove removal. The study also demonstrated that proper techniques and training can help lower the risk of skin or clothing contamination while removing personal protective equipment, highlighting the need for improvements in equipment design and disinfection prior to removal, as well as better training on proper removal techniques."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water.

Paragraph: The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up.

(CNN) -- A federal appeals court in San Francisco has temporarily halted the forced medication of Tucson shooting defendant Jared Loughner until a three-judge panel can hear competing arguments from his lawyers and prosecutors by mid-week. Loughner is charged with seriously wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a January rampage that also left six others dead. The brief order from a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals set a tight deadline for lawyers from both sides to file more detailed legal briefs. The federal government has until 5 p.m. PT Wednesday to argue the involuntary medication should continue. Loughner has already started receiving the powerful drugs, and lawyers representing","completion":"him argue that forcibly medicating their client violates his constitutional rights. They contend that the forced medication risks damaging Loughner's ability to understand the charges against him and assist in his own defense, potentially derailing any chance of a fair trial. Additionally, they express concerns about potential side effects of the medication on their client's mental health, requesting clearer justification for such actions. The prosecution, on the other hand, asserts that the involuntary medication is necessary for ensuring both the safety of Loughner and others around him, as well as to render him competent to stand trial. They cite ongoing assessments from mental health professionals that have deemed Loughner a danger to himself and others in his current state. The prosecution's argument hinges upon the belief that, without proper treatment, Loughner's mental state might deteriorate further, resulting in an inability to prosecute him for the serious charges he faces. Throughout the rest of the week, the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reviews the submitted briefs and holds a series of debates to weigh the competing claims. While both sides present compelling arguments, the panel ultimately rules in favor of Loughner's defense team, citing concerns over his constitutional rights and the potential harm to his mental health. The federal appeals court immediately orders a halt to the involuntary medication of Loughner, directing both parties to devise an alternative treatment plan that balances Loughner's rights with the need for him to be competent enough to stand trial. The court acknowledges the serious nature of the charges against him and the importance of providing a fair trial to both the defendant and the victims of the January rampage. In the weeks that follow, Loughner's legal team works closely with mental health professionals and the prosecution to devise an alternative, mutually agreeable treatment plan that involves close monitoring of Loughner's mental state, voluntary medication with appropriate oversight, and additional therapy sessions. This collaborative approach ensures Loughner's rights are respected, while at the same time addressing concerns about the safety of all involved. Ultimately, with a more comprehensive treatment plan in place, Loughner's mental condition begins to improve, allowing him to better understand the proceedings against him. As the trial progresses, both the prosecution and defense teams present their cases, and the jury eventually finds Loughner guilty on multiple counts for his actions during the January rampage. The case serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between the need to protect society and administer justice and the importance of upholding an individual's rights, even in the face of such heinous crimes. The court's decision to prioritize Loughner's constitutional rights while still ensuring a fair trial highlights the complexities of the justice system and the critical role of jurists in shaping its outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth?, using the article: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the person that wrote \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the given article.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following. -no -yes","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. To answer the questions, it's important to differentiate between Torrent as a technology and the act of torrenting copyrighted material without permission. Torrent, or BitTorrent, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol that allows users to download and upload files by connecting to several other users simultaneously. It is a decentralized method of sharing data and has proven to be very effective and efficient for transferring large files. The use of the Torrent protocol itself is not illegal, as it can be used for sharing any type of files, including those that are in the public domain, under a Creative Commons license, or freely distributable open-source software. However, torrenting can be illegal if it is used to download or distribute copyrighted material without the copyright holder's permission. This is called copyright infringement, and it is against the law in most countries. Sometimes, users might unknowingly engage in copyright infringement when using torrent services due to the vast amount of files shared on these platforms. In conclusion, it's not the Torrent protocol that is inherently illegal but rather the way some individuals choose to use it. If someone uses torrenting to share or download copyrighted material without permission, they are engaging in illegal activities. However, using Torrent to share or download files that are not copyright-protected is entirely legal. It is essential for users to be aware of copyright laws and the terms of use related to the files they are sharing or downloading to avoid legal consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

Answer: Further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of \\"freezing\\" and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect. Question: what freezes faster? hot or cold water? Answer:","completion":"The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which hot water appears to freeze faster than cold water under certain conditions. The effect is named after Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian high school student who observed this behavior while making ice cream and later published a paper with the help of a physics professor. While the phenomenon is real, the effect is not universally consistent, and the conditions under which it occurs are complex and not yet fully understood. The freezing process depends on several factors, such as the temperature difference between the water and the freezing environment, the cooling rate, evaporation, and even the properties of the container in which the water is placed. These factors can be crucial in determining the rate at which water cools down and ultimately freezes. One possible explanation for the Mpemba effect is that warmer water evaporates more quickly than cooler water, which means it loses mass and energy in the form of heat. This reduction in mass could then allow the remaining water to freeze more rapidly. Another hypothesis is that the warmer water results in a better movement of water molecules due to convection, which more evenly distributes the heat and accelerates the freezing process. There are other potential factors at play as well, such as supercooling, which occurs when a liquid remains a liquid even below its freezing point due to a lack of nucleation sites for ice crystal formation. When this occurs, warmer water may freeze faster if it is closer to the required nucleation temperature. Additionally, researchers have noted that the freezing rate could be affected by the presence of dissolved gases, salts, and other impurities in the water, which may vary depending on the initial temperature. These impurities can alter the freezing point and the overall freezing dynamics. In conclusion, there is no straightforward answer to the question of what freezes faster: hot or cold water. The phenomenon known as the Mpemba effect suggests that, in certain conditions, hot water can freeze faster than cold water. However, to provide a definitive answer, further investigations will need to take place that decide on a precise definition of \\"freezing\\" and control a vast number of starting parameters. This will help researchers to confirm or explain the effect more accurately, and better understand the physical processes involved in water transitioning from liquid to solid states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Before jumping, Mykhailo Chechetov wrote a note. He said he had “no moral strength” to live, and thanked people for their support. Then he stepped out of the window of his 17th-floor apartment, leaving his slippers behind for his wife to find later. Chechetov was once a senior member of Ukraine’s Party of Regions, which had a strong grip on power until the revolution a year ago. His death on 28 February was the second in a string of apparent suicides by top members of the party which until last year had dominated Ukrainian politics. Four such officials died within several weeks. All of them were under criminal investigation by the incumbent authorities. The leader of the Party of Regions, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, fled the nation at the height of the Maidan revolution, leaving his allies stunned and struggling to accept a new reality. The party started disintegrating rapidly. Many of its members ended up facing trials for corruption, extortion, abuse of office and even murder. The rampant corruption and venality of the ruling elite under Yanukovych spurred the revolution in February last year, and those in the new government say the old guard are simply receiving just desserts for previous misdeeds. However, some in the former elite claim the process is a politically-motivated witch-hunt. Either way, the spate of apparent suicides shows the psychological toll the process is having on those who ruled Ukraine before the revolution. Chechetov was accused of fixing the result of a vote in parliament last January for a set of “dictatorship laws” aimed at curbing the civil freedoms of protesters at the height of the revolution. Other cases against him were being lined up, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, whose agency handles parts of the investigations. Chechetov’s funeral in Kiev was accompanied by saxophone music and whispers about continuing probes. Serhiy Larin, a member of the Opposition Bloc, a political heir to the Party of Regions in parliament, says that more than 20 cases involving former party members are currently being investigated. He said: “Hundreds of people in provinces are called in daily for questioning by investigators. We’re also seeing the general prosecutor turning into a punitive organ. This is how democracy is being destroyed.” Yet Gerashchenko brushes aside all accusations. He says the Party of Regions for years ruled like there was no tomorrow, never expecting to be punished for its crimes. He said: “These people used to be in power and used to solve all their problems through corruption, but now they understand the inevitability of punishment.” Now they are “cracking up”, he adds. Serhiy Valter, the mayor of Melitopol in the south-east of Ukraine, was found hanged in his home on 25 February. “Prosecutors asked for 14 years in prison for him. He was extorting from business, and was likely to get a guilty verdict,” Gerashchenko said. Stanislav Melnyk, a former MP and the top manager of a brewery, shot himself in his home in a suburb of Kiev on 9 March. Just three days later, Oleksandr Peklushenko, a former governor of Zaporizhya in south-east Ukraine, was also found shot in his home. Gerashchenko explained: “He shot himself the moment he realised that he might get a guilty verdict in court for hiring thugs to break up a protest. “Just imagine what people in England would do if one party hired thugs to kill another party.” Separately, Yanukovych’s younger son, also named Viktor, died at the weekend when the van he was driving fell through the ice on Lake Baikal in Siberia. Yanukovych Jr was a Party of Regions MP before the revolution. There is no evidence to back theories that there may be foul play involved in the spate of suicides, but opposition MPs say the trend points to a wave of intimidation at the very least. Members of the party who remain in Ukraine are feeling scared and reluctant to talk about the cases against them in public. “Everyone’s afraid. They don’t want to have to jump from windows, shoot themselves – or be helped,” said one former Party of Regions member who has moved to the Opposition Bloc. Another member of the Opposition Bloc said: “This is pressure with cases that have no bases, and cases are being fabricated like it’s 1937. This is why the weaker ones break up.” Larin, who believes the authorities are acting selectively and illegally, said: “Endless questioning, pressure from investigators, direct threats – the aim is not the rule of law, but political expediency. This is justice to order.” On 12 March, the general prosecutor’s office put four Party of Regions members on a national wanted list for the same crime as Chechetov, as well as a Communist party member. The prosecutor said those five failed to show up for questioning in his office. The party hit back, saying the prosecutor was conducting a “show trial, trying to divert attention of the society from a catastrophic situation in the economy and the social sphere” in recession-battered, war-stricken Ukraine. Moreover, it said that one man on the wanted list, a former parliament member, Volodymyr Demydko, has been in coma for weeks after prosecutors’ questioning caused a stroke. The party said the government released “deliberate lies” about Demydko when he was accused of failure to testify. “This is pressure with cases that have no basis, and cases are being fabricated like it’s 1937,” said another senior member of the Opposition Bloc who did not want to be identified. “This is why the weaker ones break up.” Gennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was shot in the back during a run last April. He survived, but is now under investigation for kidnapping and torturing political opponents during the revolution. Viktor Shokin, the general prosecutor, said last month that the case is almost ready to go to court. Kernes, however, has insisted it is political. Ukraine has a history of political prosecutions. Yanukovych jailed his former opponents Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko soon after being elected in 2010. The European court of human rights said both cases were politically motivated. Gerashchenko said the difference is that the charges against Tymoshenko and Lutsenko were trumped up, and they did not feel any guilt. He said: “If these people (from the Party of Regions) did not feel guilty, they would not end their lives, they would go and fight in courts like Tymoshenko and Lutsenko. They would fight with their heads raised up high.” Title:","completion":"\\"Former Ukrainian Ruling Party's Dark Descent: A String of Suicides and Accusations\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement you provided is a reasonable and concise answer that touches upon the main roles and responsibilities of the President of the United States. However, for a more detailed and long answer, it is crucial to elaborate on the specific duties, responsibilities, and powers of the President. The President of the United States is the head of state, head of government, and chief executive of the federal government. As stated in your answer, the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially since the founding of the nation. The President's roles and responsibilities cover a wide range of areas, including legislative, executive, and judicial matters, as well as being the commander-in-chief of the military. 1. Legislative Role: Although the President does not have formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills, they play a significant role in shaping the legislative agenda of their party. The President can propose bills to Congress and work with the majority party in Congress to promote their policy priorities. The President is also responsible for preparing and submitting a budget request to Congress each year, outlining the administration's priorities and providing a framework for Congress to develop appropriations legislation. 2. Executive Role: The President is responsible for enforcing and implementing federal laws and directing the executive branch of the government. This includes appointing high-ranking officials such as Cabinet Secretaries and Ambassadors (subject to Senate confirmation) and issuing orders, known as Executive Orders, which carry the force of law and are used to direct the activities of the executive branch agencies. 3. Judicial Role: The President has the authority to nominate judges to the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court, a power that can significantly shape the interpretation of laws and the Constitution for decades. These nominations are subject to the \\"advice and consent\\" of the Senate, which must confirm the nominees through a majority vote. 4. Commander-in-Chief: As the commander-in-chief of the military, the President has the ultimate responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend the United States and its Constitution. They have the authority to deploy military forces in response to crises, conflicts, and threats to national security, subject to the provisions of the War Powers Resolution and the need for Congressional authorization in certain circumstances. 5. Diplomatic Role: The President is responsible for directing the nation's foreign policy and representing the United States in diplomatic relations with other countries. They have the authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements, which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. The President can also recognize foreign governments, receive diplomats and ambassadors, and negotiate executive agreements with other heads of state. 6. Crisis Management and Emergency Powers: In times of crisis, the President is responsible for leading the nation and managing the government's response, whether it involves natural disasters, terrorism, or economic downturns. The Constitution grants the President emergency powers, which can include the suspension of certain rights or liberties, the mobilization of resources, or the imposition of martial law, subject to legal limitations and oversight by Congress and the courts. In conclusion, the President of the United States has numerous roles and responsibilities that extend beyond the formal legislative powers. Their influence on domestic and foreign policy, as well as their ability to shape the nation's direction through appointments, diplomacy, and crisis management, make the President a significant figure both within the United States and the global community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere. Question: \\"What label assigned to him did Camus reject?\\" Answer: \\"Enigma\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

In 1973, Bakshi and Ruddy began the production of Harlem Nights, which Paramount was originally contracted to distribute. While Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic proved that adult-oriented animation could be financially successful, animated films were still not respected, and Bakshi's pictures were considered to be \\"dirty Disney flicks\\" that were \\"mature\\" only for depicting sex, drugs and profanity. Harlem Nights, based on Bakshi's firsthand experiences with racism, was an attack on racist prejudices and stereotypes. Bakshi cast Scatman Crothers, Philip Michael Thomas, Barry White and Charles Gordone in live-action and voice roles, cutting in and out of animation abruptly rather than seamlessly because he wanted to prove that the two mediums could \\"coexist with neither excuse nor apology\\". He wrote a song for Crothers to sing during the opening title sequence: \\"Ah'm a Niggerman\\". Its structure was rooted in the history of the slave plantation: slaves would \\"shout\\" lines from poems and stories great distances across fields in unison, creating a natural beat. Bakshi has described its vocal style, backed by fast guitar licks, as an \\"early version of rap\\". Bakshi intended to attack stereotypes by portraying them directly, culling imagery from blackface iconography. Early designs in which the main characters (Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear and Preacher Fox) resembled figures from The Wind in the Willows were rejected. Bakshi juxtaposed stereotypical designs of blacks with even more negative depictions of white racists, but the film's strongest criticism is directed at the Mafia. Bakshi said, \\"I was sick of all the hero worship these guys got because of The Godfather.\\" Production concluded in 1973. During editing, the title was changed to Coonskin No More..., and finally to Coonskin. Bakshi hired several African American animators to work on Coonskin, including Brenda Banks, the first African American female animator. Bakshi also hired graffiti artists and trained them to work as animators. The film's release was delayed by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which called Bakshi and his film racist. After its distribution was contracted to the Bryanston Distributing Company, Paramount canceled a project that Bakshi and Ruddy were developing, The American Chronicles. Coonskin, advertised as an exploitation film, was given limited distribution and soon disappeared from theaters. Initial reviews were negative; Playboy commented that \\"Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together.\\" Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The Hollywood Reporter, New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper) and elsewhere. The New York Times' Richard Eder said the film \\"could be [Bakshi's] masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form--cartoons and live action combined to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence\\". Variety called it a \\"brutal satire from the streets\\". A reviewer for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner wrote, \\"Certainly, it will outrage some and, indeed, it's not Disney. [...] The dialog it has obviously generated--if not the box office obstacles--seems joltingly healthy.\\" Bakshi called Coonskin his best film.

(CNN) -- During his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made headlines by directly criticizing the Supreme Court for its decision in Citizens United v. FEC, the political funding case. He said Citizens United would \\"open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.\\" Certainly the decision has made it much easier for corporations and unions to directly spend unlimited sums of money in support of their favored candidates. One wonders, however, whether Obama realized at the time how much his own political allies, and therefore his own re-election effort, might benefit from Citizens United.

A liberal Democratic congressman who came under fire for a lewd photo that briefly appeared on his Twitter account over the weekend told CNN Wednesday that he did not post the image. Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner spoke to CNN's Wolf Blitzer a day after a contentious exchange with reporters in which he refused to directly answer any questions about the picture. On Wednesday he said he had hired a law firm to look into the matter. But he declined to directly answer whether he appeared in the photo. \\"Photos can be manipulated. Photos can be of one thing and changed to something else. We're going to try to get to the bottom of what happened,\\" he said. The photo showed the lower body of a man wearing underwear. A conservative blogger who broke the story has called for a full investigation of what he said was either the hacking of a congressman's account or something Weiner wants to hide. But Weiner told CNN he did not think such steps are necessary to deal with what he said was internet spam, an issue that many Americans face. \\"Just because it happened to Congressman Weiner on his personal account doesn't mean that the taxpayers should pay for an investigation,\\" he said. \\"I'm going to turn it over to some people who are going to give me advice on what to do next. \\"This seems like it was a prank to make fun of my name, the name Weiner. It happens a lot,\\" he added. Asked whether he was protecting anyone, Weiner replied, \\"Yes, I'm protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality. You know, we've been married less than a year.\\" He also declined to say what he had written in direct messages to Twitter followers. \\"I'm not going to get into how I communicate with people on social media. There was nothing ... inappropriate,\\" he said. An e-mail that Twitter sent to members of Congress Wednesday lists several online security tips, according to a copy of the e-mail CNN obtained. The message does not specifically mention the photo posted on Weiner's page, but notes that questions about account security have surged recently. \\"Some of you inquired today about the security of Twitter accounts,\\" Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote. \\"While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials.\\" Weiner on Tuesday told reporters he wasn't interested in talking about the issue any more, saying he already made statements over the Memorial Day weekend after the photo turned up on his Twitter account Friday night. In a heated exchange with reporters, he repeatedly dodged direct questions about the photo. \\"If I were giving a speech to 45,000 people, and someone in the back threw a pie or yelled out an insult, I would not spend the next two hours of my speech responding to that pie or that insult. I would return to the things that I want to talk about,\\" Weiner said in response to a question about whether he sent the lewd photo to a Seattle woman. He also refused to say why he hasn't asked law enforcement to investigate if in fact his account was hacked, as he has said it was. Despite repeated efforts by reporters, Weiner did not directly answer questions about the photo. In earlier comments, when asked if the photo was of him, Weiner deflected the question. \\"I'm not going to talk about this anymore,\\" he said, adding: \\"I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about,\\" including economic issues and what he calls a conflict-of-interest situation involving conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on the health care reform law. The New York Democrat is a leading liberal voice in Congress. Asked several questions about the Twitter situation Tuesday, Weiner stuck to his message. \\"I understand you're doing your job, but I'm going to go back to work now,\\" Weiner said at one point. When asked if he was concerned about being hacked, he responded: \\"I'm going to return to working on the things I care about. I participated in the story a couple of days now, given comments on it. This is a distraction and I'm not going to let it distract me.\\" When a reporter noted the distraction might go away if he answered the questions, Weiner answered: \\"I'm not convinced of that. \\"I'm not convinced there's any value of me talking about it,\\" Weiner said. Asked again if he was the man in the photo, Weiner responded again that he had made previous statements and now it was time for him to get back to work. On Wednesday, Weiner told CNN that he regretted \\"the way that I handled it yesterday and I'm trying to do a better job today.\\" Previously, Weiner blamed the photo on a hacker who got control of his social-networking accounts and played a prank. Weiner's spokesman, Dave Arnold, said Monday the congressman has retained an attorney to look into the situation. No formal criminal investigation has been launched, which rankles Andrew Breitbart, whose conservative website biggovernment.com first reported the photo on Weiner's Twitter account in connection with a tweet to a Seattle woman. Breitbart, who has been involved in questionable tactics against Democrats and liberals in the past, told CNN on Tuesday that the case warrants further investigation. \\"There's something fundamentally different between a prank and a hack -- a prank is innocuous, a hack is criminal,\\" Breitbart said, later adding he wanted a full investigation by the FBI and Capitol Police. However, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday he believed the situation was a harmless prank unworthy of further investigation. \\"Twitter is not a very secure environment,\\" Toobin said, noting that information on the site can be unreliable \\"and doesn't even come from the people it appears to come from.\\" He added: \\"There's a famous expression -- don't make a federal case out of it.\\" CNN's Kate Bolduan, Dana Bash and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this story.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The first issue was related to providing information on the remuneration and bonuses of the management personnel in annual reports. In more detail, this issue is associated with the necessity of disclosing the salary, compensation, and bonus structures of the company's management, specifically the top-ranking executives and board members, in the annual financial reports. Such disclosure is important for various reasons, including transparency, accountability, and fostering trust among the shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Transparency in management remuneration is crucial as it ensures the shareholders and other potential investors are aware of how the company's top management is being compensated for their work. This helps assess the alignment of the management's interests with the long-term success and growth of the company. It can also serve as an indicator of the company's financial stability and market competitiveness, as investors generally prefer companies with a balanced and well-thought-out remuneration structure. Accountability is another key factor as disclosing executive compensation signifies that the company's top management is responsible for their actions and decisions. By publicly sharing this information, it puts the management under greater scrutiny from the shareholders and the broader public. This can help prevent excessive risk-taking, mismanagement, or unethical practices, which can lead to potential financial and reputational damage to the company. Fostering trust among stakeholders is another essential aspect. Providing information on the remuneration and bonuses of the management personnel in annual reports demonstrates the company's commitment to openness, fairness, and ethical practices. This can help build confidence and trust among employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders, which is essential for maintaining a positive corporate reputation and fostering long-term business growth. In conclusion, disclosing the remuneration and bonuses of management personnel in annual reports can have significant positive impacts on the company, such as promoting transparency, accountability, and trust. It is an important aspect of corporate governance, and companies must ensure that they diligently and openly share this information in their annual financial reports, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions and evaluate the management's commitment to acting in the best interests of the company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said. Menocal said clashes between authorities and Los Zetas had notably increased. Question: \\"A state of siege declaration lasts how many days?\\" Answer: \\"30 days\\" Is this answer correct?

The track-owning BRDC ultimately gambled on making a loss next year by succumbing to Ecclestone #39;s proposed race fee. The only sticking point now is the duration of a new contract -- Bernie wants to renegotiate","completion":"This statement is about a negotiation scenario related to a Formula 1 race event to be hosted at Silverstone Circuit, managed by the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC). Specifically, it highlights a deal being discussed between the BRDC and Bernie Ecclestone, the former chief executive of the Formula One Group, who managed the commercial aspects of Formula One racing. The primary concerns in the negotiation revolve around the race fee and contract duration. To provide some context, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) is a renowned organization that owns and manages the Silverstone Circuit, the world-famous venue for the Formula 1 British Grand Prix. Formula 1 is a highly popular international motorsport series that generates significant revenue through various channels, such as ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcasting rights. Bernie Ecclestone had been the chief executive of the organization primarily responsible for the commercial aspects of Formula 1 racing for four decades before being removed from his position in 2017. He played a pivotal role in shaping and expanding the sport, both commercially and globally. Ecclestone often negotiated with track owners and promoters to secure the best deals for Formula 1 races. In this particular scenario, the track-owning BRDC is in the midst of deciding whether to accept Ecclestone's proposed race fee. To do so would likely result in a financial loss for the upcoming year, but the BRDC and the stakeholders may view this short-term setback as an acceptable compromise if it ensures the British Grand Prix remains at Silverstone. The event is not only a significant revenue generator for the local economy, but it also holds historical and cultural importance as the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship race was hosted at Silverstone in 1950. However, the discussion between the BRDC and Ecclestone hits a sticking point when it comes to the duration of the new contract. Ecclestone wants to renegotiate the terms after a certain period, whereas the BRDC would likely prefer a more extended contract so that it has some financial security and stability over the medium to long term. Ecclestone's preference to renegotiate allows for more frequent adjustments of the race fees, potentially leading to better outcomes for the Formula One Group in the future, but it also introduces uncertainty for the BRDC. In conclusion, this statement refers to a negotiation between the British Racing Drivers' Club and Bernie Ecclestone regarding the race fee and contract duration for hosting Formula 1 races at Silverstone. The BRDC is considering accepting a short-term loss to secure the prestigious event, while the main point of contention lies in the new contract's duration. This negotiation highlights the intricate balancing act between financial concerns, historical importance, and the need for flexibility and stability in the world of professional motorsport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"James Chadwick, an English physicist, is credited with the identification and discovery of the neutron in 1932. The neutron is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom, carrying no electrical charge and having a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. His groundbreaking discovery significantly expanded the understanding of atomic structure and provided essential insights into nuclear reactions and the development of atomic energy. Before Chadwick's discovery, atomic structure was primarily understood through the Rutherford-Bohr model, which described atoms as having a nucleus composed of positively charged protons surrounded by negatively charged electrons in orbit. The model, however, could not explain essential aspects of atomic behavior, such as the stability of certain elements or the contribution of atomic mass. Chadwick's investigation began when he reviewed the work of German physicists Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker, who observed that bombarding light elements like beryllium and boron with alpha particles resulted in the emission of a highly penetrating radiation. At first, this radiation was incorrectly thought to be gamma rays. However, the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie and his wife Irène Joliot-Curie found that these \\"gamma rays\\" could eject protons from paraffin wax, suggesting that the radiation actually consisted of particles with substantial mass. Taking these findings into account, Chadwick designed a series of experiments to further examine the mysterious radiation. By placing a beryllium target in a sealed chamber filled with a specific gas and bombarding it with alpha particles, he observed that the emerging radiation could eject protons from the gas. He then measured the energies of the incident alpha particles, emitted radiation, and protons, and utilized the conservation laws of energy and momentum to determine the characteristics of the radiation's particles. Through these meticulous experiments, Chadwick ultimately deduced that the radiation was not a form of electromagnetic waves but rather a stream of uncharged particles similar in mass to protons. Chadwick named these particles \\"neutrons\\" and published his findings in a groundbreaking paper in 1932. His discovery earned him the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics and laid the foundation for the development of nuclear energy, atomic weapons, and a more accurate understanding of atomic structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Water comes through a filter - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose smaller pores in filter happens, how will it affect HELPING the water purifier to work better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having smaller pores in the filter does have a direct effect on the water purification process, and it could potentially help the water purifier to work even better. Here's a detailed explanation of how this perturbation might impact the process: 1. Improved filtration: With smaller pores in the filter, it is likely that more pollutants, including smaller particles or contaminants, will be captured and removed from the water. This means that a greater percentage of impurities will be filtered out, resulting in cleaner and safer water for consumption on the other side of the filter. 2. Increased removal of harmful chemicals and metals: By having smaller pores, the filter will have a higher efficiency in capturing not only physical particulates but also chemicals and metals like chlorine, lead, and mercury. This enhances the water purifier's overall performance in delivering safe and clean water. 3. Slower flow rate: While smaller pores can lead to better filtration, they can also decrease the flow rate at which the water passes through the filter. This slower flow rate allows the filter more time to trap and remove contaminants, which could further improve the water quality. However, this may also mean that it takes longer to fill a glass or container with purified water. 4. Reduced filter lifespan: The downside of smaller pores is that they can become clogged more quickly, reducing the filter's overall lifespan. This means that the filter may need to be replaced more frequently to maintain optimal performance. Nonetheless, this could be seen as an acceptable trade-off for improved water quality. 5. Additional treatment processes: If the water contains particularly harmful contaminants that become problematic due to the smaller pores, additional treatment processes or pre-filters may be required (e.g., activated carbon, reverse osmosis) to ensure the water is appropriately purified. This could improve the overall effectiveness of the water purifier but may also increase costs and complexity. In summary, having smaller pores in a water filter can indeed help a water purifier to work better by removing a higher percentage of contaminants and impurities, providing cleaner and safer water. However, this perturbation also introduces some potential drawbacks, including a slower flow rate and shorter filter lifespan, which users should consider when evaluating overall performance improvements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: America After Saying Yes, Duke Nixes Muslim Call To Prayer From Chapel Bell Tower i itoggle caption IPS Lerner/UIG via Getty Images IPS Lerner/UIG via Getty Images Duke University announced this week it would allow the traditional Muslim call to prayer from the Duke Chapel bell tower. The reaction from some Christian groups was angry, and today the private university in Durham, N.C., reversed course. \\"Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students,\\" Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations, said in a statement. \\"However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect.\\" The call to traditional Muslim Friday prayers, which are currently held in the Duke Chapel's basement, will now take place in the quadrangle outside the chapel, the statement said. The location is used for interfaith programs and activities. The basement will continue to host the Friday prayer services afterward. More than 700 of the university 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students identify as Muslim. The Associated Press reports that though the chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church, it previously has hosted Hindu services and Buddhist meditations. In an opinion piece this week in the News & Observer in Raleigh, Christy Lohr Sapp, associate dean for religious life at Duke University Chapel, called the decision to allow the call to prayer from the Duke Chapel \\"a larger commitment to religious pluralism that is at the heart of Duke's mission.\\" But the university's decision was excoriated by Christian groups, and figures such as evangelist Franklin Graham, the son of the Rev. Bill Graham, criticized it on Facebook. Graham appeared placated today by Duke's about-face.

On Thursday, just days after announcing that a traditional Muslim call to prayer would echo from the historic chapel tower, Duke University... (Associated Press) Instead, Muslims will gather for their call to prayer in a grassy area near the 210-foot gothic tower before heading into a room in Duke Chapel for their weekly prayer service. The university had previously said a moderately amplified call to prayer would be read by members of the Muslim Students Association from the tower for about three minutes each Friday. Michael Schoenfeld, Duke's vice president for public affairs and government relations, said it would be up to the students if they want to use some sort of amplification. The original plan drew the ire of evangelist Franklin Graham, who urged Duke alumni to withhold support because of violence against Christians that he attributed to Muslims. Schoenfeld said emails and calls came from alumni and others in the community. \\"There was considerable traffic and conversation and even a little bit of confusion, both within the campus and certainly outside, about what Duke was doing,\\" Schoenfeld said. \\"The purposes and goals and even the facts had been so mischaracterized as to turn it into a divisive situation, not a unifying situation.\\" He also said there were concerns about safety and security, but he declined to elaborate on whether any specific threats had been received. Graham, the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, wrote later in the day that the university made the right decision to cancel the plan to use the tower. However, Schoenfeld said the reversal was not due to Graham's opposition. Shalini Subbarao, 19, a sophomore from St. Louis, said she was disappointed with the school's reversal as she walked past the chapel. \\"I thought it was really progressive. It showed our openness to other religions,\\" she said of the original plan. The campus was mostly business as usual on Thursday afternoon, with students leaving classes, waiting for a cross-campus bus or heading to evening meetings. Several said they were not familiar with the issue, while others' reactions were mixed. Ios Kotaogiannis, a 39-year-old doctoral candidate in computer science who is from Greece, said he was glad officials reversed their decision. \\"I'm a secular person. I'm not against religion. I think religion is good. But it has its place — inside the chapel,\\" he said. The chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church but also hosts Hindu services and has been used for Buddhist meditations. The chapel's associate dean for religious life, Christy Lohr Sapp, said before the plans were canceled that the move showed the school's commitment to religious pluralism. In a column written for The News & Observer of Raleigh, Lohr Sapp acknowledged the headlines generated by violence by extremists in ISIS, Boko Haram and al-Qaida, contrasting it to what's happening on campus. \\"Yet, at Duke University, the Muslim community represents a strikingly different face of Islam than is seen on the nightly news: one that is peaceful and prayerful,\\" she wrote. The private university in Durham, northwest of Raleigh, was founded by Methodists and Quakers, and its divinity school has historically been connected to the United Methodist Church. Duke has nearly 15,000 students, including about 6,500 undergraduates. The school's insignia features the Christian cross and a Latin motto translated as \\"learning and faith.\\" The university says more than 700 of its students identify themselves as Muslim. Schoenfeld said Duke was one of the first universities in the country to hire a full-time Muslim imam when the first was named in 2008. Muslim students have been holding prayer services in the basement of the chapel for the past two years. ___ Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker and Emery P.

The incident took place when Qikang was caught on camera looking at a woman's shorts. As the situation escalated, the footage continued to capture him stroking her upper thigh. Realizing the woman had turned around, Qikang quickly pretended to look at his phone in an attempt to disguise his actions. Wang Qikang's case serves as a high-profile example of inappropriate behavior and demonstrates the swift response by his employer and the party to address such substandard conduct. Shanghai Jinjiang, established in 1985, has become one of China's well-known travel agencies and stands as a prominent example of the state-run businesses that form a cornerstone of the country's economy. The company has a strong position within the industry and receives significant support from the government. The decision to exile Qikang from the Communist Party makes it apparent that both the company and the government hold their employees to a high code of conduct and ethical standards. This incident provides a window into the often-unseen challenges that women face in the workplace. Incidents of this nature are jarring and invasive, serving as a stark reminder of the work that remains to be done in combating inappropriate behavior and creating a safe and equal environment for all employees. As a result of the incident, Wang Qikang will no longer be allowed to participate in the Communist Party, a prestigious membership that implies strong allegiance to the party's ideals and policies.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: \\" To seek happiness is to look for it\\" was once said by the famous French author Jules Renard. Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, \\" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?\\" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,. Question: Who most probably feels happy? Options: A: Mrs. Brown,dreaming of having a better--paid job. B: Mrs. Black, loving his teaching job deeply. C: Mrs. Rowling, being unwilling to face failure. D: Mrs. Lee, refusing his best friend's apology. A:","completion":"Based on the article, the one who most probably feels happy is B: Mrs. Black, loving his teaching job deeply. This option aligns with the first key to happiness mentioned in the article, which is accepting yourself and being at peace with your current state. Mrs. Black seems to have accepted and found joy in his current job, which, according to the article, is a vital step toward happiness. The other options suggest dissatisfaction or conflict with the current reality, such as dreaming for a better job, unwillingness to face failure, or refusal to forgive, which are contrary to the paths toward happiness indicated in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Knowth has two passage graves. Sentence 2: KNowth has two graves.

In this case, Sentence A (Sentence 1) is \\"Knowth has two passage graves\\" and Sentence B (Sentence 2) is \\"Knowth has two graves.\\" Step 1: Understand the two sentences. Sentence 1 specifies that Knowth has two specific types of graves - \\"passage graves.\\" Sentence 2 suggests that Knowth has two graves but does not specify the type. Step 2: Compare the sentences. In the comparison, there is a reduction of specificity from Sentence 1 to Sentence 2, from \\"passage graves\\" to just \\"graves.\\" However, since \\"passage graves\\" are a type of grave, Sentence 1's claim that Knowth has two \\"passage graves\\" would also imply that Knowth has two \\"graves.\\" Step 3: Make a conclusion based on the comparison. Given the reduction in specificity, yet the fact that Sentence 2's claim falls within the scope of what is conveyed in Sentence 1, it can be said that Sentence 2 (Knowth has two graves) is indeed entailed by Sentence 1 (Knowth has two passage graves). This is because if Sentence 1 is true (Knowth has two passage graves), then Sentence 2 (Knowth has two graves) must also be true. Therefore, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are many colours in nature. But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall. That means our body temperature will change when we see different colours. Question: What will happen when you get into a cool coloured room from a warm coloured room? Answer: OPTIONS: (a). You will feel excited.; (b). You will be happy and contened.; (c). Your temperature will fall.; (d). You will be nervous.; Answer:","completion":"(c).

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Subprime mortgage crisis. Yes or no? Answer: The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008. Question: when us subprime mortgage market collapse Answer:","completion":"Yes, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was indeed a significant event that contributed to the financial crisis and recession that started in 2008. The collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market began in 2007 and reached its peak in 2008, causing severe consequences for the global financial system. Subprime mortgages refer to home loans given to borrowers with lower credit scores and a higher probability of defaulting on their repayments. In the years leading up to the crisis, there was an immense growth in the subprime mortgage market, largely driven by factors such as low-interest rates, increased securitization of mortgages, and a housing market boom. Major financial institutions, attracted by high-interest rates and the seemingly never-ending growth of the housing market, started issuing more subprime mortgages and invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These securities pooled together mortgages and were sold to investors who hoped to profit from the repayments made by borrowers. In order to create more MBS, lenders began lowering underwriting standards for mortgages, approving riskier loans, and lending to borrowers who would have previously been ineligible. The subprime mortgage market began to collapse when housing prices started to decline significantly in 2006, and many borrowers found themselves with mortgages they could not afford. As a result, the default rates on subprime mortgages skyrocketed, leading to substantial losses for the investors who held MBS and other mortgage-related securities. This ignited a series of events that led to the broader financial crisis. In 2007, banks and other financial institutions began experiencing liquidity issues, and by mid-2007, the situation deteriorated so severely that some of the largest subprime mortgage lenders in the United States filed for bankruptcy. These events exposed the excessive risk-taking and flawed practices that had taken place within the financial sector. As institutions across the world started to report major losses on their subprime-related investments, the financial crisis spiraled out of control, leading to the collapse of several major banks and the government bailouts of others. The crisis spilled over into the broader economy, resulting in job losses, decreased consumer spending, and a prolonged recession that lasted well into the next decade. In summary, the U.S. subprime mortgage market collapse began in 2007 and reached its peak in 2008, significantly contributing to the global financial crisis and subsequent recession. This crisis stemmed from a series of unsustainable practices in the financial sector, such as issuing risky loans and investing in complex mortgage-backed securities. The fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis had widespread and long-lasting effects on the economy, affecting millions of individuals and businesses around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Inside the mind of Oscar Pistorius Oscar Pistorius, the double amputee and Olympic athlete on trial for murder, has said that, once he was introduced to competitive running, he has “never looked back.” That may be one reason why he vomited upon hearing how the Black Talon bullets he fired into his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp ripped apart his girlfriend’s body. He couldn’t turn his back; he couldn’t run away. The past would not disappear. Without question, Pistorius’ past is full of trauma and triumph. Born without fibulas, he underwent below the knee amputations when he was just 11 months old. No one can underestimate the struggles of a boy to grow up without legs, or the courage required to do so, nor the remarkable force of will it takes to compete against able-bodied athletes while wearing carbon fiber limbs. Maybe, though, there was more than sadness and resolve that took hold inside the mind of Oscar Pistorius as he moved forward in life, through sheer determination. I have never met the man, and certainly have not treated him, but it seems as though rage was building up inside Pistorius, too. During 2008, when a young woman refused to leave a party he was hosting, he was arrested for assaulting her by slamming a door on her leg. The charges were later dropped. A former girlfriend, Samantha Taylor, has testified that Pistorius was both controlling and prone to rage. Once, after being stopped by police for a traffic violation, Pistorius reportedly fired a gun through the open sunroof of his car. Oscar Pistorius, it seems, does not like being stopped. And he does not like looking back. The trouble with that, of course, is that, when taken to an extreme, it prevents a person from confronting and being humanized by the pain and suffering inherent in his past, and risks being dehumanized by it. Maybe buried feelings of vulnerability from being a child without legs can explain why, as a man, he kept tigers as pets. Maybe the halting steps he needed to take at three and four and nine years old can explain why he not only had a passion for speed as a runner, but, according to a profile in the New York Times magazine, drove at 155 miles per hour, in the rain. Maybe it explains why he was in the habit of going to a gun range to shoot when he couldn’t sleep at night—to use the alchemy of gunpowder to turn anxiety into power. Maybe it explains why he reportedly threatened to break the legs of a man who he believed was flirting with his then-18-year old girlfriend. Maybe it even explains why he reportedly accidentally once shot a friend of his in the foot. When a man without legs slams a young woman’s leg in a door, threatens to break another man’s legs and shoots his buddy in the foot, it doesn’t take a psychiatrist to wonder whether he has really overcome all his feelings about losing his limbs and whether he has run away from feeling disempowered, in part by seeking power over others. If Oscar Pistorius is found guilty of murdering Reeva Steenkamp, it may well be because she argued with Mr. Pistorius and locked the door to the bathroom in which she died, putting something immovable in his path—something he might have liked to—but couldn’t—kick down. And for a man who has “never looked back” at the past once he strapped carbon fiber blades to his knees and started running, that door, standing defiantly on its hinges, could have been an intolerable reminder of it. Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team. Dr. Ablow can be reached at info@keithablow.com.","completion":"The article delves into the mind of Oscar Pistorius, providing an insight into the struggles he has faced and his determination to overcome them.

Instances of this rage include an arrest for assault in 2008, having been controlling with an ex-girlfriend, Samantha Taylor, and even firing a gun through his car's sunroof after being stopped for a traffic violation. The article suggests that Pistorius' actions may be driven by past feelings of vulnerability and a desire to gain power and control over others.

Ryan is carrying groceries from his car back to his apartment when he trips and falls landing on his knees. Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it. Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, more blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee. This can be inferred from the description of his left knee being warm to the touch, which is a sign of inflammation. Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism of the body against infections or injuries and is caused by chemicals released when skin or other tissues are damaged. These chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand, leading to increased blood flow in the affected area. In Ryan's case, the fact that his left knee is warm indicates that there is an ongoing inflammatory response taking place in his left knee due to the scrape that occurred when he fell. The dilation of blood vessels in the area has led to increased blood flow, making his left knee warm. On the other hand, his right knee is cooled and doesn't show signs of warmth or inflammation, which suggests that there is less blood flow to that area. To sum up, more blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee in response to the inflammatory process happening there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids. - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes. Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip. - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences. - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805. - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae).

Step 1: In the sentence, the subject is \\"the Earth,\\" the verb is \\"is made,\\" and the object is \\"new.\\" The word \\"then\\" functions as an adverb, indicating that this action happens after something else. The word \\"too\\" emphasizes that the Earth is also included. Step 2: Translate each word into Spanish: - Then = Entonces - The Earth = La Tierra - too = también - is made = es hecha - new = nueva Step 3: Put the words in the correct order for Spanish sentence structure, which is usually Subject-Verb-Object-Adverb. In this case, it would look like this: Entonces, La Tierra también es hecha nueva. So, the translation of \\"Then the Earth too is made new\\" in Spanish is: \\"Entonces, La Tierra también es hecha nueva.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Try wearing lip balm at night to moisturize your lips while you sleep. Apply the lip balm right before bed so that your lips will benefit from the treatment in the morning. If you do not have any lip balm, then you can just use a bit of olive or coconut oil (at room temperature) on your lips instead. Moisturizing your lips during the day is also important. You can use an intense moisturizing balm if your lips are extra dry, but a regular tube of lip balm will also work. Keep your lip balm handy and reapply it often. Before you apply any liner or lipstick to your lips, you should apply a deep moisturizing lip balm or at least a heavy layer of regular lip balm. This will help to create a moist, smooth canvas for your lipstick. Apply the lip balm to your lips about 15 to 30 minutes before you want to apply your lipstick. Look for a lipstick that is moisturizing rather than long lasting. Long lasting lipsticks may dry out or irritate your lips more than other types of lipstick. If you are planning on some serious kissing, then you may want to go with a nude or pale pink shade rather than a bright red or coral. Otherwise your kissing partner may end up with lipstick all over. A lip stain may also be a good choice because stains do not come off your lips as easily.","completion":"To have soft and kissable lips, keep them moist by putting on lip balm before bed and during the day.

An eyewitness said the man was a \\"Chinese American doctor\\" who would not give up his seat, US media reported. The man has not yet been identified. United Airlines issued an official apology after the incident. In a video taken by Audra Bridges who was on board the flight from Chicago to Louisville, the visibly distressed man was seen being hauled out of his seat. It was watched more than 12m times and shared 161,000 times on Facebook. Photos of his bloodied face also spread quickly online. Reports said the flight was overbooked and so passengers were selected by United Airlines and asked to take a later flight. According to the New York Times, passenger Tyler Bridges who witnessed the scene, said that the man had shouted: \\"I'm being selected because I'm Chinese\\". Ms Bridges in her post said: \\"This man is a doctor and [said he had] to be at the hospital in the morning.

Question: We can make mistakes at any age. Some mistakes we make are about money. But most mistakes are about people. Why do we go wrong about our friends? Sometimes people hide their real meanings when they say something. And if we don't really listen, we miss the feeling behind the words. Suppose someone tells you, \\"You're a lucky dog.\\" That's being friendly. But \\"lucky dog\\"? There's a bit of envy in those words. Maybe he doesn't see himself. But \\"lucky dog\\" puts you down a little. He may mean you don't deserve your luck. How can you tell the real meaning behind someone's words? One way is to take a good look at the person talking. Do his words fit the way he looks? Do his words agree with the tone of voice? His posture ? The look in his eyes? Stop and think. If you spend the minute thinking about the real meaning behind one's words, it may save another mistake.

Please answer this question: who was involved in the valentine's day massacre?","completion":"To accomplish this task, I'll need to research the details of the Valentine's Day Massacre and identify the individuals involved. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of my approach: 1. Understand the context: The Valentine's Day Massacre, an infamous event, took place on February 14, 1929. It was a major incident during the Prohibition Era in the United States. 2. Determine the nature of the event: I already know that the Valentine's Day Massacre was a violent incident, so I'll focus on any criminal organizations or individuals that were involved in it. 3. Research details about the event: By searching for information on the Valentine's Day Massacre, I can learn about the motivation behind the event, the parties involved, and the individuals implicated. After researching the Valentine's Day Massacre, I found the following details: - The Valentine's Day Massacre was a gangland mass murder that took place in Chicago, Illinois, between two powerful criminal organizations: the North Side Irish gang, led by George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, and the South Side Italian gang, led by Al \\"Scarface\\" Capone. - The event led to the murder of seven members of Bugs Moran's gang. - Al Capone's gang is believed to have orchestrated the massacre to eliminate Bugs Moran and take control over the lucrative bootlegging business in Chicago. However, Bugs Moran was not present at the massacre and managed to escape the attack. - The actual killers have never been conclusively identified, but suspects included notorious hitmen from both the Capone gang and other criminal groups. To summarize, the two main parties involved in the Valentine's Day Massacre were Al Capone's South Side Italian gang and George \\"Bugs\\" Moran's North Side Irish gang. The specific individuals who carried out the attack have never been definitively identified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling I found the following answer on Google: Assuming a fixed sample size, the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups, not between them. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the given answer is correct to some extent, but it does not fully explain the difference between multistage and cluster sampling. Let me provide a more detailed and long answer: Multistage and cluster sampling are both probability sampling techniques used when dealing with large, dispersed populations. They are methods to select a representative sample from a population for the purpose of research or data analysis. However, the approach and structure used in each method are different. Multistage Sampling: Multistage sampling is a technique that involves multiple stages in selecting samples from a population. In this approach, the population is divided into various subgroups (usually hierarchical), and then the samples are selected sequentially at each level. The primary purpose of multistage sampling is to simplify the process of data collection and reduce costs without sacrificing the representativeness of the sample. Multistage sampling usually follows these steps: 1. Divide the population into different levels like regions, cities, districts, or neighborhoods. 2. Select the first-stage samples from these levels. 3. Further divide the first-stage samples into smaller units. 4. Select the second-stage samples from these smaller units. 5. Continue this process until the desired unit of analysis is reached. Cluster Sampling: Cluster sampling is a technique in which the population is divided into groups or clusters; these clusters should be heterogeneous and contain similar variations as in the whole population. Then, a random sample of clusters is selected, and all units within these chosen clusters are included in the sample. Cluster sampling usually follows these steps: 1. Divide the population into non-overlapping clusters. 2. Select a random sample of clusters. 3. Include all units within the selected clusters in the sample. Comparison of Multistage and Cluster Sampling: The primary difference between the two methods lies in the process of selecting samples. In multistage sampling, samples are selected step by step from different levels, while in cluster sampling, samples are selected all at once in the form of clusters. When it comes to accuracy, multistage sampling can be more accurate if there is a high degree of similarity within the subgroups in each stage, whereas cluster sampling gives more accurate results when there is significant variation within the clusters but less variation between the clusters. Another difference is that multistage sampling can be more efficient in terms of data collection costs because samples are selected sequentially, thus reducing the need for collecting data from the entire population. In conclusion, both multistage and cluster sampling are useful techniques for dealing with large, dispersed populations. The choice between the two methods depends on factors like the population structure, available resources, and research objectives. While the provided Google answer is correct to some extent, it does not differentiate between the two methods and explain their unique characteristics."},{"prompt":"We have two daughters: Kristen is seven years old and Kelly is four.Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner.I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang.Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom.

Question: You are given a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. and a hint : Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Please answer this question : Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the parcel of land that had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers is Tom's land. This is because the hint mentions that in forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, resulting in an excess of water percolating downward through the soil layers.

Based on the sentence \\"Man plays backgammon on a cobbled sidewalk with another man while talking on his cellphone while a third man looks on.\\", is the sentence \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors.\\" is a true sentence based on the initial statement. Let's analyze the original sentence and the derived sentence to understand why this is the case. Original sentence: \\"Man plays backgammon on a cobbled sidewalk with another man while talking on his cellphone while a third man looks on.\\" From this sentence, we can gather the following information: 1. There are three men involved in this situation. 2. Two of the men are engaged in playing backgammon on a cobbled sidewalk, which implies an outdoor location. 3. One of the men who is playing backgammon is also talking on his cellphone. 4. There is a third man who is observing the situation or \\"looking on\\". Now, let's examine the derived sentence: \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors.\\" This sentence conveys the following facts: 1. There is a person observing or watching the scene. 2. Two other people are engaged in playing a game. 3. The game and the watching are both happening in an outdoor setting. Comparing the original sentence and the derived sentence, we can see that the derived sentence captures the essence of the original one, albeit with fewer details. The two men playing backgammon are represented as \\"two others playing a game,\\" the cobbled sidewalk confirms the outdoor setting, and the third man looking on can be considered as \\"a person watches\\". Therefore, the sentence \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence. It is a simplified summarization of the main events happening in the original statement, although it doesn't contain specific details such as information about the game being backgammon or the fact that one of the players is talking on his cellphone."},{"prompt":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Chelsea Manning says she is being denied gender-reassignment treatment A year after being sentenced to a 35-year prison term for giving secret documents to WikiLeaks, US army private Chelsea Manning says the military is continuing to deny her gender-reassignment treatment. In a letter sent to NBC news and released on Friday, Manning says the Defence Department has not followed through with its promises after the defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, approved a treatment plan that includes allowing her to dress as a woman. “Unfortunately, despite silence, and then lip-service, the military has not yet provided me with any such treatment,” Manning wrote in a statement sent to NBC from Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas. “However, prisons – and especially military prisons – reinforce and impose strong gender norms – making gender the most fundamental aspect of institutional life.” Manning was sentenced as Bradley Manning in August 2013 for leaking nearly 700,000 documents to the site WikiLeaks. The documents revealed a 38-minute video of an American airstrike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists and wounded children, as well as embarrassing diplomatic cables. Shortly after the sentence was handed down, Manning went public with her gender dysphoria. “Despite having received at least four diagnoses of gender dysphoria, Chelsea has received no treatment,” Manning’s attorney, David Coombs, told NBC News. Manning’s requests for hormone therapy and amended grooming and clothing standards have all been denied, Coombs said. “If the military does not do the right thing, we are prepared to pursue litigation to vindicate her constitutional rights,” Coombs said. Earlier this month, Coombs threatened to file a lawsuit if treatment did not begin by 4 September. Manning said in her letter to NBC that the prison’s gender norms make it hard to “feel comfortable in my own skin”. “For example, in my daily life, I am reminded of this when I look at the name on my badge, the first initial sewed into my clothing, the hair and grooming standards that I adhere to, and the titles and courtesies used by the staff. Ultimately, I just want to be able to live my life as the person that I am.” “The continued failure to provide Ms Manning with this treatment is inconsistent with well-established medical protocols and basic constitutional principles,” Chase Strangio, attorney for the ACLU’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement to the Associated Press earlier this month. Strangio said refusing to treat Manning is “cruel and unusual punishment,” and advocates for Manning stressed that “there is a clear medical consensus that gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition,” which, left untreated, “can lead to severe medical problems”. The army declined to tell NBC if treatment would begin soon. “The Department of Defence has approved a request by army leadership to provide required medical treatment for an inmate diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I can’t discuss the medical needs of an individual,” an army spokeswoman, Lt Col Alayne Conway, told NBC. Calls from the Guardian to Fort Leavenworth were directed to the military’s chief public information office. Calls to that office were not immediately returned.","completion":"US Army private Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced to a 35-year prison term for giving secret documents to WikiLeaks, claims she is being denied gender-reassignment treatment by the military.

Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B? Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, car B, the older car without a catalytic converter, would contribute to a less clean atmosphere compared to car A. The absence of a catalytic converter in car B means that the harmful emissions produced during the combustion of fuel are not effectively converted into less harmful substances. As the hint explains, catalytic converters help increase the rate at which unburned hydrocarbons are converted into carbon dioxide and water, carbon monoxide is oxidized into carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. These processes significantly decrease the harmful emissions released by cars and contribute to a cleaner atmosphere. In contrast, car A is newer and has a catalytic converter, ensuring that the harmful emissions are treated before being released into the atmosphere. This results in cleaner and more environmentally friendly emissions, making car A the better choice in terms of reducing air pollution and contributing to a cleaner atmosphere. Despite John's preference for car B's design, it is important to consider the environmental impact, and car A would be a more environmentally responsible choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence: \\"Lee received 1,012 out of 1,064 votes while Chiang received 873 votes.\\" This sentence tells us that: 1. Lee received 1,012 votes. 2. There were a total of 1,064 votes cast. 3. Chiang received 873 votes. In the second sentence: \\"1,012 out of 1,064 votes, while Lee received 873 votes.\\" This sentence presents incomplete information. It tells us that: 1.

In the first one, Lee received the higher number of votes (1,012), while Chiang received the lower number of votes (873). In the second sentence, Lee received 873 votes, but the person who received 1,012 votes is not identified, and it omits information about Chiang's votes. To make the second sentence convey the same meaning as the first sentence, it should be rewritten as: \\"Chiang received 873 votes while Lee received 1,012 out of 1,064 votes.\\" Now, both sentences convey the same information about Lee and Chiang's votes."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

This action shows that she is proactive and probably has a passion for cats or is proud of her cat's qualities and achievements. She might have invested time and effort into making sure Casey is well-groomed, trained, and prepared for the show. Furthermore, Addison is described as excited, which indicates that she is enthusiastic about the event and looking forward to the cat show. Excitement usually implies that someone is looking forward to an experience or anticipates positive outcomes, such as receiving compliments about her cat or even winning an award at the event. People who feel excited are typically characterized as being in a positive and high-energy emotional state. Since there is no information about Addison's feelings after the show, we cannot assume that she would feel sad when it is over.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person for whose illustrations it is suggested that the Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover likely served as a source of inspiration?, using the article: The \\"ship portrait\\" had a long history in maritime art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \\"plats\\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"Anthony. The name of the person for whose illustrations it is suggested that the Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover likely served as a source of inspiration is Anthony. In the context provided, it is evident that Anthony created detailed ship illustrations and that his work on the three plats depicting naval actions and expeditions share similarities with the painting \\"Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover.\\" Therefore, the painting is considered a likely source of inspiration for Anthony's illustrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about John? Answer:","completion":"It's important to note that the original text does not provide direct information about John, and thus making any definitive statements about him could be misleading or inaccurate. However, we can infer some possibilities about John's role or experience in an organization, based on the context provided. In an organization characterized by the dynamics explained in the context, John could be: 1. An employee who faces challenges due to the traditional management hierarchy, which may restrict or impact his creativity, ideas, and potential. 2. A leader who recognizes the complexities and nuances within the organizational structure, and strives to promote a more inclusive, engaging working environment, where employees feel valued and can contribute more effectively. 3. A professional who has experienced growing divides between senior leadership and employees on the ground level in previous organizations, thus gaining insights and understanding of the common issues that arise in such settings. 4. Someone who has identified issues within organizational structures, and perhaps endeavors to foster a healthier, more cohesive work environment that allows for employees to feel empowered, respected, and able to contribute. 5. An individual who understands that frustrations and conflicts, while unavoidable, can serve as catalysts for improvement within companies, and therefore may be inclined to view challenges within his organization as opportunities for positive change and growth. In summary, while we cannot make specific claims about John due to a lack of information, it's probable that he is involved in the organizational dynamics discussed in the context, experiencing or attempting to manage the challenges presented."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\\" is a country music ballad written and composed by Kris Kristofferson and released on his 1970 album \\"Kristofferson.\\" - Kristoffer \\"Kris\\" Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actor. He wrote and recorded the songs \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", \\"For the Good Times\\", \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\\" and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein. In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", the latter for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller. Others performed the song later, including the Grateful Dead, Kristofferson himself, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition and most famously by Janis Joplin, whose posthumously released version topped the U.S. singles chart in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Joplin's version as the No. 11 song for 1971. - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - Sings Kristofferson is a studio album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979 consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs . It reached # 5 on the US Country albums chart , # 42 on the US Pop albums charts , and was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US . The cover is very simple , a single picture of Nelson 's face against a black background , with the song titles to the right of his face . The back cover is the same background with both Nelson and Kristofferson 's faces together . - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added. What is the relationship between 'sings kristofferson' and 'columbia records'? A:","completion":"The relationship between 'Sings Kristofferson' and 'Columbia Records' is that 'Sings Kristofferson,' an album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979, consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs, was released under the Columbia Records label. Columbia Records gave Willie Nelson total creative control over his works after he signed with them. The success of his previous \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" album in 1975, which was also released under Columbia Records, further solidified this relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Context: In November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \\"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\\" (Ian Edmond, Record Collector). At Pierce's instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound. In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the home studio of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. These \\"fine set of performances\\" (Ned Raggett, AllMusic) would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as \\"rehearsals in Rugby\\"). Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish's band The Jazz Butcher were signed. Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with Glass Records in early 1986. Question: what was the album called?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The album mentioned in this context is called \\"Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To.\\" It was an unofficial release, which consisted of the demos recorded by Spacemen 3 in January 1986 at Carlo Marocco's home studio.

Groening was born on February 15, 1954 in Portland, Oregon, the middle of five children (older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952, while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958, respectively). His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (nee Wiggum; March 23, 1919 - April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 - March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family. Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book Life in Hell, which was loosely inspired by the chapter \\"How to Go to Hell\\" in Walter Kaufmann's book Critique of Religion and Philosophy. Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. The strip, titled \\"Forbidden Words,\\" appeared in the September/October issue of that year. Groening had gained employment at the Los Angeles Reader, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper. Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25, 1980. Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, \\"Sound Mix,\\" in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his \\"various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems\\" instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he \\"just made stuff up,\\" concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the \\"music\\" column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons. Life in Hell became popular almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish \\"Love is Hell\\", a series of relationship-themed Life in Hell strips, in book form. Released a month later, the book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work is Hell soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for Life in Hell. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life in Hell, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life in Hell. At the end of its run, Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School is Hell, Childhood is Hell, The Big Book of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell. Although Groening has stated, \\"I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation,\\" he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark Life in Hell's conclusion. After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work. The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening's cartoonist friends who were influenced by Life in Hell.","completion":"This text is about Matt Groening, an American cartoonist, writer, producer, and animator born on February 15, 1954, in Portland, Oregon.

Though the exterior had a charming appeal, the ambiance inside was quite lacking. The lighting was too dim, making it hard for us to read the menu, and the music was so loud that it was difficult to have a conversation with my friends. Our server seemed to be in a hurry and barely had time to attend to our queries about the menu. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes for our food, which was quite frustrating. The menu had a good variety of dishes, but the portion sizes turned out to be smaller than expected, even for upscale dining. While the presentation of the dishes was remarkable, the taste and quality were a letdown. The chicken dish we ordered was overcooked and dry, and the seafood pasta, though flavorful, had a fishy odor indicating that the ingredients might not have been fresh. The salad, however, was enjoyable, with a tangy dressing and a blend of fresh greens. Considering the high price we paid for our meal, the overall experience was disappointing. I wish the food and service matched the price point and the positive reviews that initially drew us to The Rustic Spoon.

Given the below context: The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics.... Guess a valid title for it!

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. After reading the above, is \\"False\\" the correct answer to the question \\"True or false.

Memorize the first section individually, then move on to the next, repeating the process. Then, once you've memorized each section, put them all together. Make a mental note about the overall topic of each section you created. This will provide a point of reference and help jog your memory while you recite your monologue. While you are reviewing your monologue, make mental images in your mind for each section you created. If at any point you forget a line from the script, think back to the mental images you created. This strategy is especially helpful for visual learners. A part of the memorization process is repeating the lines out loud over and over again. While you’re doing this, don’t repeat it in the exact same way every time. Instead, play around with the lines. This will help you to keep the lines fresh in your mind and learn them subconsciously instead of mechanically. For example, recite your monologue as fast and as slow as you can, say it in a funny voice, or say with a different dialect. Writing things down can increase your retention because you use different parts of your brain than when you're speaking. Writing also activates muscle memory and allows you to slowly absorb every word and sentence. So write down your entire monologue a couple of times until it stays in your memory. When memorizing a monologue, it helps to do some sort of physical activity while you practice it. You can do something simple while you recite it, like washing the dishes or cleaning your room. This will help you to learn the monologue without giving it much thought. Make sure to keep the script nearby during your physical activity, so if you forget a line you can easily refer to it. During one of your practicing sessions, use your cell phone, computer, or digital camera to record yourself reciting the lines. Then, watch the recording and take mental notes about your performance. This will not only help you memorize the monologue, but it will also help you determine aspects of your performance that you can improve upon. If you’re auditioning for a role or trying to get a good grade in an acting class, pay close attention to your facial expressions, posture, speed, and volume. These are important features that the judges will be looking at during your performance. It may help to repeat your recording multiple times. While listening, try to say the words along with or slightly ahead of the recording. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article suggests that memorizing a long monologue can be made easier by dividing it into sections and practicing them individually before putting them together. Creating mental images for each section, experimenting with different ways of reciting the lines, writing down the monologue, and incorporating physical activities while practicing can help improve retention.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 148*z = 1571 + 3609 for z, we need to follow the following steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation First, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation. 1571 + 3609 = 5180 Now the equation looks like this: 148*z = 5180 Step 2: Isolate the variable, z To find the value of z, we need to isolate z on one side of the equation by dividing both sides by the coefficient of the z term, which is 148. z = (5180 / 148) Step 3: Solve for z Now, we just need to perform the division: 5180 ÷ 148 ≈ 35 Step 4: Check the solution (optional) To ensure the accuracy of our solution, we can plug our value of z back into the original equation and check that both sides are equal: 148 * 35 = 1571 + 3609 5180 = 5180 (True) Since both sides of the equation are equal, we have confirmed that our solution is accurate.

He's a world well-known on space and time. Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages.

He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering compared to Forest B, the temperate forest in Germany. Tropical forests, such as Forest A, experience higher temperatures, more insolation (sun exposure), and more rainfall over longer growing seasons. These factors contribute to an extremely productive biomass, leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. The higher temperatures and larger amounts of water in these forests lead to higher rates of chemical weathering. In these tropical forests, increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Due to this, tropical forests have little to no podzolization (a soil formation process that creates distinct soil layers) and therefore do not show marked visual and chemical contrasts between soil layers. In contrast, mobile metals such as magnesium, iron, and aluminum are precipitated as oxide minerals in these tropical soils, resulting in a rusty red color. Temperate forests like Forest B experience cooler temperatures, less rainfall, and shorter growing seasons than tropical forests. Due to these differences in environmental conditions, the chemical weathering process in temperate forests would be slower as compared to tropical forests. Consequently, Forest A would experience higher rates of chemical weathering, compared to Forest B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The holiday commemorates the Declaration of Independence of the United States on July 4th, 1776. The celebrations typically involve fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. If your question is related to what specific day of the week the Fourth of July falls on this year, it varies year by year because our modern Gregorian calendar cycles every 7 days. You could easily determine this by looking at a current year calendar. However, if your question pertains to when the Fourth of July will be observed in terms of a public holiday, it depends on the specific circumstances. If July 4th happens to fall on a Saturday, the public holiday might be observed on the preceding Friday. If it falls on a Sunday, the public holiday might be observed on the following Monday, as per the \\"Friday-to-Monday\\" rule in the United States, which shifts certain holidays to ensure employees still get a day off. This is determined by each individual state government and can also vary by company. Lastly, if your question refers to when the Fourth of July will be celebrated in the sense of major public festivities such as parades and fireworks displays, that is typically determined by local city or town governments and can vary widely. Some cities may have their major celebrations on the weekend nearest to July 4th, regardless of which day it falls on, to accommodate more people being off work. In conclusion, while the Fourth of July is always on the 4th of July, exactly when it is observed as a public holiday or when the major public celebrations occur can vary depending on a variety of factors.

Movie title: Queen of the Vampires Context: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants.

Both sentences describe the action of feeding a mouse to a snake, although the actual words used are different. Part #3: Not necessarily include all the details as the input text. Usage: Sample response \\"A man offers a rodent to a serpent.\\" In this example, the phrase \\"as food\\" was omitted, but the meaning of the sentence still conveys that a man is providing a rodent to a serpent. The context makes it evident that the rodent is offered as food, so removing the phrase \\"as food\\" does not significantly change the meaning and still paraphrases the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of both components. Positive aspects of the review: 1. The reviewer acknowledges that visiting the store was worth the trip for the New Year's Day sale. This indicates that they likely found great deals and were satisfied with the products or discounts they encountered during the sale. 2. Although not explicitly stated, the fact that the store is a clearance store may be seen as a positive aspect by some potential customers who are looking for discounted items. Negative aspects of the review: 1. The reviewer expresses surprise at realizing it was a clearance store. This surprise may indicate a lack of clear advertising or signage that the store is focused on clearance items. 2. The mention of the store being old and run down implies that the physical appearance and maintenance of the store are not up to the reviewer's standards. These factors can significantly impact the shopping experience and may deter some potential customers from visiting the store. In conclusion, while the review contains positive elements related to finding value during the New Year's Day sale, negative aspects regarding the store's appearance and initial lack of clarity about its clearance status may dampen the overall impression of the reviewer's experience. The mixed nature of this review suggests that potential customers should weigh the importance of discounts and deals against the store's appearance and ambiance when deciding whether to visit this location."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell.

I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where did the professional career of the director of music videos of an American rapper born in 1975 begin? Answer:","completion":"The professional career of the director of music videos for an American rapper born in 1975 began in the early stages of the rapper's musical journey and the rise of the hip-hop scene in the 1990s. Although this question does not specify a particular rapper or director, I will provide a comprehensive answer by examining various possibilities and scenarios. One of the most renowned American rappers born in 1975 is Marshall Mathers, popularly known as Eminem. Eminem's music video career began to take off after he signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. The director most closely associated with Eminem's early music videos is Phillip Atwell, who began his professional career in the mid-1990s as a director and cinematographer. Atwell started out by working on various music videos and commercials, eventually making a name for himself in the hip-hop community. He first collaborated with Eminem in 1999 for the \\"My Name Is\\" music video, which marked the beginning of their long-standing relationship in Eminem's video career. Another notable American rapper born in 1975 is Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson. The music video director who has frequently worked with 50 Cent from the beginning of his career is Jessy Terrero. Terrero began his professional career in the late 1990s, directing music videos for many artists within the hip-hop and R&B genres. He gained prominence in 2003 when he directed 50 Cent's \\"Wanksta\\" music video, which contributed to the rapper's skyrocketing fame. This collaboration established a strong partnership, with Terrero directing several other 50 Cent music videos over the years. A third example of an American rapper born in 1975 is Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs, who was also the founder of Bad Boy Records. The music video director most associated with his early work is Hype Williams. Williams began his career in the early 1990s, directing several music videos for various artists within the hip-hop and R&B genres. He cultivated a distinctive visual style that incorporated vibrant colors, fish-eye lens perspectives, and cinematic aesthetics. Hype Williams' collaborations with Diddy started back in 1994 with the music video for \\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\\" which initiated Combs' progression in the music video realm. In summary, the professional careers of music video directors for American rappers born in 1975, such as Eminem, 50 Cent, and Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs, commenced during the 1990s and early 2000s as the hip-hop industry underwent significant growth. Directors like Phillip Atwell, Jessy Terrero, and Hype Williams emerged as prevalent forces within the music video production landscape, working with some of the biggest names in the hip-hop scene, including these rappers born in 1975. Their artistic visions and cinematic approaches not only contributed to the rappers' successful careers but also to the overall development and impact of the hip-hop music video genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a breakdown of the translation: - Kırk yaşındaki kadın (The 40-year-old woman): In Turkish, it is more common to specify the gender when describing someone's age. We have assumed the gender is female in this translation; if the subject is male, you can replace \\"kadın\\" with \\"adam\\". - Ayda 400 euro kazanarak (earning 400 euros a month): In Turkish, to express that an action is ongoing or continuous, we use the present continuous tense. The verb \\"kazanmak\\" (to earn) is suffixed with the gerund/instrumental suffix -arak (in this case -arak, because the last vowel of \\"kazanmak\\" is 'a'), making it \\"kazanarak\\" (earning). The monthly earnings and the adverb \\"ayda\\" (per month) are placed before the gerund to form the complete phrase. - Yarı zamanlı sahne elemanı olarak çalışmakta (works part-time as a stagehand): In Turkish, sentence structure often places the object before the verb. In this case, the object (sahne elemanı) is placed after \\"yarı zamanlı\\" (part-time) and before \\"olarak çalışmakta\\" (working as). The verb \\"çalışmak\\" (to work) is also in the present continuous tense, suffixed with -ta to form \\"çalışmakta\\" (working). - Ve bu durum onu annesi ve kız kardeşiyle yaşamaya zorlamaktadır (and this situation forces her to live with her mother and sister): In Turkish, the conjunction \\"ve\\" (and) is used to combine the two clauses. The subject \\"bu durum\\" (this situation) is followed by the verb \\"zorlamak\\" (to force) in the present continuous tense as \\"zorlamaktadır\\". The indirect object \\"onu\\" (her) is placed before \\"annesi ve kız kardeşiyle yaşamaya\\" (to live with her mother and sister) to form the complete clause."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Very bad but watchable science fiction film that suffers from abominable special effects, poor acting, and a ridiculous story. The film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on Mars with a woman and a man with green slime on his arm. She, through some hokey plot contrivances, begins to tell what happened on this fateful trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be magnetically wiped off. Four astronauts take on this journey: a military type played by Gerald Mohr, a poor man's Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word \\"Irish\\" and has the acting savvy of a codfish, then there is Naura Hayden, a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves, next, Les Tremaine, a wonderful character actor from cheap sci-fi films like this as the egghead, and last, Jack Kruschen as Sammy - the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics. None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film. But bad acting aside, the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them. You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Bat-rat-spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together. The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye. Whew! These are bad. There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film. Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization. Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated. One guy is using an electric razor with a cord and I thought they can get to Mars but they are still using cords.

His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\".

According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of −1.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand.

Article: The majority of Indian women wear a red dot between their eyebrows. While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \\"bindi\\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom. Question: What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition? Options: A: To pay respect to God. B: To stay in harmony with nature. C: To see things with a subjective view. D: To observe the outside world more clearly.

Movie plot title: Life Is Hot in Cracktown Movie plot: The film intertwines several unsettling stories of people in a Manhattan neighborhood ravaged by crack cocaine.[1][2] Romeo, a 14-year-old criminal, is the leader of a gang. In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobsâthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors.

In Russian, the order of the words often changes when compared to English. Один из ведущих люксовых отелей Дубая - this means \\"one of Dubai's foremost deluxe hotels\\". In Russian, adjectives tend to come before what they are describing (i.e., \\"deluxe hotels\\"). где гостям гарантирован незабываемый отдых - this translates as \\"where guests are assured a memorable vacation\\". Again, the adjective comes before the noun in Russian, so \\"memorable vacation\\" becomes \\"незабываемый отдых\\". или деловая поездка - This means \\"or business trip\\". Note, the word \\"или\\" is used to say \\"or\\" in Russian. в самый захватывающий город ОАЭ - Lastly, it translates into \\"to the UAE's most exciting city\\". Russian has a different syntactic structure than English, that is why the translation goes from left to right as \\"The Dusit Dubai Hotel\\", \\"one of the leading luxury hotels in Dubai\\", \\"where guests are guaranteed an unforgettable vacation\\", \\"or a business trip\\", \\"to the most exciting city in the UAE\\".

Q:Sam lived in Chicago for many years and experienced those high humidity days during the summer, the Indian summers in October and harsh and humid winters, so he decided to move to San Diego, in a warmer and much dryer climate. Which city has more humidity during winter? A:","completion":"During the winter months, Chicago experiences more humidity than San Diego. To understand why, it is essential to compare the climates of these two cities during the winter season. Chicago, located in the Midwest and positioned near the banks of Lake Michigan, has a humid continental climate characterized by harsh, cold winters. The average high temperature in Chicago during winter typically ranges from 31°F to 34°F (-1°C to 1°C), while the average low temperature hovers between 16°F to 22°F (-9°C to -6°C). Due to its proximity to Lake Michigan, Chicago experiences lake-effect snow, which forms when cold air moves over the relatively warmer water of the lake. This causes an increase in moisture and eventually leads to snowfall on the leeward side of the lake. This phenomenon not only increases the humidity levels during winter but also results in significant snow accumulation, averaging about 35 inches (89 cm) per season. San Diego, on the other hand, is situated on the southern coast of California and enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild to cool winters and warm, dry summers. The average high temperature in San Diego during winter typically ranges from 65°F to 67°F (18°C to 19°C), while the average low temperature falls between 48°F to 52°F (9°C to 11°C). Due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean and the semi-arid climate, San Diego experiences less humidity during winter months than Chicago. Although San Diego can get occasional rainfall during winter, it is not as frequent or significant as the snowfall in Chicago, resulting in overall lower humidity levels. In conclusion, Chicago experiences more humidity during winter compared to San Diego, primarily due to its humid continental climate, the proximity to Lake Michigan, and the impact of lake-effect snow. San Diego's Mediterranean climate, coastal location, and infrequent winter rainfall contribute to its relatively lower humidity levels during the winter season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Aves and a sister group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs. What is the answer to this question: Besides Aves, what group contains the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria?","completion":"Besides Aves, which are the birds, the other group that contains the only living representatives of the reptile family called Archosauria is Crocodilia.

The ombudsman deals with complaints which financial firms have been unable to settle themselves. Caroline Wayman, who heads up the body, said: \\"PPI complaints are down, but there are some suggestions that this could be the calm before the storm.\\" A deadline of June 2019 could be set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for disgruntled customers to make compensation claims to their banks and credit card issuers about mis-sold PPI policies.

The compensation process has not been smooth for customers though. Since 2003 about one and a half million people have been so dissatisfied with the PPI offers that were made to them, or the outright rejection of their claims, that they have subsequently gone to the financial ombudsman. In the second half of 2016, nearly half of the PPI complaints to the ombudsman were upheld against the top ten most-complained about businesses. However, the uphold rate varied wildly between providers, from 9% for Nationwide to 29% for Bank of Scotland and 69% for Financial Insurance Company Ltd, part of the AXA group. The list of most-complained about businesses - for all types of complaint to the financial ombudsman - is still dominated by the UK's High Street banks, and some credit card lenders. Top of the list in the last half of 2016 was the Bank of Scotland, which is part of the Lloyds banking group, with nearly 20,000 new complaints against it. It was followed by Lloyds bank itself, Barclays, HSBC, NatWest, the credit card firms Capital One and MBNA, Santander and the Nationwide building society.","completion":"The UK's Financial Ombudsman Services received 78,000 complaints about payment protection insurance (PPI) in H2 2016, although financial conduct authority the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is expected to impose a June 2019 deadline for customers seeking compensation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The species was found in Monroe County, Florida, in 2012.\\" In this statement, the author emphasizes that Perigea bahamica is a species of moths collected in the Bahamas (note the use of \\"collected\\"). Then, the author adds that the species was found in Monroe County, Florida, in 2012, potentially indicating a discovery, expansion, or migration of the species into that area at that time. Statement 2: \\"Perigea bahamica is a moth in the family Noctuidae. It is found in the Bahamas. The species was collected in Monroe County, Florida, in 2012.\\" This statement presents similar information but with a slight change in wording. It notes that Perigea bahamica is a species of moths \\"found\\" in the Bahamas, which implies natural presence or distribution in the area.

This could signify that researchers or scientists collected samples of this species in Florida. While both statements provide similar information, the use of \\"collected\\" versus \\"found\\" in describing the moth's presence in the Bahamas slightly changes the reader's understanding of the moth's habitat and distribution. To sum up, both statements convey that Perigea bahamica is a moth species in the family Noctuidae, has connections to the Bahamas, and has been documented in Monroe County, Florida, in 2012.

Evaluate the temperature: Pantries are typically at room temperature and are not cold enough to chill the bananas to the desired consistency for ice cream. Refrigerators, on the other hand, are cooled to a lower temperature and can more effectively chill the pureed bananas. 2. Consider food safety: Chilling food in the refrigerator minimizes the risk of bacterial growth, ensuring the safety and quality of the pureed bananas. Pantries may not be cold enough to prevent spoilage. 3. Time factor: Although both options suggest chilling for at least 5 hours, the refrigerator's colder temperature ensures that the bananas will be sufficiently chilled within that timeframe.

Joseph Lewis Miller spent more than 33 years hiding, ducking police for a murder charge out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to a statement from U.S. Marshal Martin Pane. Now 78, Miller was arrested Monday in Mineola, Texas, where he was living under the alias Roy Eugene Eubanks and serving as a deacon at a church, the statement said. A 1981 arrest warrant charges Miller with murder, committing crimes with a firearm, being a convict in possession of a firearm and carrying a firearm without a license. Harrisburg police accused Miller of killing Thomas Waller in a parking lot adjacent to a hotel in January 1981. \\"The murder occurred more than three decades ago, and while this case presented us with a significant challenge it also exemplifies the dedication, thoroughness and diligence the fugitive task force has toward cold cases,\\" Pane said. This wasn't the first time Miller was charged with murder. Miller pleaded guilty to killing John H. Lumpkins in Harrisburg in 1960, and throughout that decade, Pane said, Miller applied to have his sentence commuted, a request that was granted with lifetime state parole in 1971. Ten years later, Miller became a fugitive after Waller's death. Recently, the U.S. Marshals Service developed information on a Roy Eugene Eubanks in East Texas, the Marshals Service said. \\"Working with photographs more than three decades old, Marshals believed the man named Roy Eugene Eubanks was indeed Joseph Lewis Miller,\\" the statement said. Authorities put an East Texas home under surveillance Monday and soon saw a man believed to be Miller. They arrested him without incident and recovered a firearm from the home, the statement said. \\"The individual admitted his true identity as Joseph Lewis Miller. He was married and a deacon in his local church,\\" according to U.S. marshals. Using his alias, Miller had been receiving Social Security disability benefits for more than two decades, the statement said. He is now in custody in Wood County, Texas, where he awaits court proceedings. \\"It is my sincere hope that the victims' family and the surviving victim can and will rest easier knowing the alleged perpetrator is now in custody,\\" Pane said in the statement.

With the growing number of people relying on taxis for their daily commute, starting a taxi company can be a lucrative business venture. However, starting a successful taxi company requires careful planning, hard work, and a clear understanding of the industry. In this article, we will discuss the key steps and strategies for starting and operating a profitable taxi company. Step 1: Determine Your Niche Before you dive headfirst into starting a taxi company, it is essential to define the specific niche you intend to target. There are several niches to choose from, such as airport transfers, corporate clients, intercity travel, and local passengers. Identifying your target market will enable you to tailor your services to meet their specific needs and preferences. Additionally, focusing on a specific niche will allow you to differentiate your business from competitors and establish a strong presence in the market. Step 2: Construct a Solid Business Plan A well-crafted business plan is the foundation of any successful enterprise. Your business plan should include: - Start-up costs: Calculate the initial capital required to launch your taxi company, taking into account vehicle purchases or leases, insurance, office and garage rentals, fuel, maintenance, and advertising expenses. - Management strategy: Outline your company's organizational structure, including the roles and responsibilities of each team member. Clearly define your goals and objectives, as well as the strategies you will implement to achieve them. - Marketing plan: Develop a comprehensive marketing plan to promote your taxi company, attract clients, and build a strong brand image. This may include creating a website, leveraging social media, offering promotions and discounts, and engaging in local advertising campaigns. - Expansion plan: Consider your long-term goals and plan for the growth and expansion of your taxi company. This may include adding more vehicles to your fleet, expanding your service area, or even entering niche markets such as courier and delivery services. Step 3: Secure Funding Once you have developed a solid business plan, the next step is to secure the necessary funding to launch your taxi company. You can apply for a loan from your bank or seek funding from private investors. Be prepared to present your business plan and financial projections to secure the required capital. Step 4: Obtain a Commercial Driver's License To operate a taxi company, you and your drivers will need to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDL) from your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The specific requirements for obtaining a CDL vary by state, so make sure to consult your local DMV for information on the process. This may involve passing a series of written and practical driving tests, as well as completing special training for transporting passengers. Step 5: Register Your Taxi Company and Obtain a Business License After obtaining the necessary licenses for yourself and your drivers, it's time to register your taxi company with your city and obtain a business license. This process typically involves submitting your business name, address, contact information, and other relevant details to your city's business registration office. Additionally, you may need to apply for a taxi operating permit, which may require providing proof of insurance, vehicle inspections, and other necessary documentation. Step 6: Build Your Fleet and Establish a Base of Operations Once you have registered your business and secured the necessary licenses and permits, the next step is to establish your fleet of taxi vehicles. This may involve purchasing or leasing vehicles, branding them with your company's logo, and installing any necessary equipment like taxi meters and navigation systems. In addition to building your fleet, establishing a base of operations is essential for the day-to-day management of your taxi company. This will typically involve leasing or purchasing commercial office space and a garage for storing and maintaining your vehicles. Conclusion Starting a taxi company can be a rewarding and profitable endeavor. However, it requires a thorough understanding of the industry, careful planning, and the perseverance to overcome challenges along the way. By following the steps outlined above, you will be well on your way to launching a successful taxi business that meets the transportation needs of your target market and stands out from the competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Louvre or the Louvre Museum is the world's largest museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Nearly 35,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet). The Louvre is the world's second most visited museum after the Palace Museum in China, receiving more than 9.26 million visitors in 2014. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille. Inhabitants of the city are called \\"Lyonnais\\". - French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km, with half of its 244,118 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union. - The Seine is a long river and an important commercial waterway within the Paris Basin in the north of France. It rises at Source-Seine, northwest of Dijon in northeastern France in the Langres plateau, flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre (and Honfleur on the left bank). It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen, from the sea. Over 60 percent of its length, as far as Burgundy, is negotiable by commercial riverboats and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating; excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the \\"Rive Droite\\" and \\"Rive Gauche\\" within the city of Paris.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. which process produces the most atp molecules in aerobic cellular respiration??","completion":"Aerobic cellular respiration is a process in which cells generate energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) from nutrients, primarily glucose, in the presence of oxygen. It consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and the electron transport chain (ETC) coupled with oxidative phosphorylation. The process that produces the most ATP molecules in aerobic cellular respiration is the electron transport chain (ETC) coupled with oxidative phosphorylation. During this stage, most of the ATP is generated by harnessing the energy from the flow of electrons through a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Now, let's examine how many ATP molecules are created in each stage of aerobic cellular respiration: 1. Glycolysis: This initial stage takes place in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen. One glucose molecule (a six-carbon molecule) is broken down into two pyruvate molecules (three-carbon molecules), producing a net gain of 2 ATP molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. 2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): During this process, each pyruvate molecule generated from glycolysis is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. The cycle occurs twice per glucose molecule, once for each pyruvate. For each turn of the cycle, 1 ATP molecule is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation, resulting in a total of 2 ATP molecules for both turns. While glycolysis and the citric acid cycle produce a relatively small amount of ATP directly, they also generate high-energy electron carriers: NADH and FADH₂. These electron carriers play a crucial role in the oxidative phosphorylation process that takes place within the electron transport chain. 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This stage takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and exploits the potential energy of the high-energy electron carriers generated in the preceding stages. NADH and FADH₂ donate their electrons to the ETC, releasing their chemical energy. As the electrons pass down the chain through a series of redox reactions, energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (proton motive force). The final electron acceptor in the ETC is molecular oxygen, which combines with electrons and protons to form water. The protons in the intermembrane space flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, a protein complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) by using the energy released by the proton gradient. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation generate roughly 30 to 34 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (10 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH + 2 FADH₂ x 1.5 ATP/FADH₂). The actual yield can vary depending on the efficiency of the transport and the cell's specific conditions. In conclusion, the electron transport chain coupled with oxidative phosphorylation is the process that produces the most ATP molecules during aerobic cellular respiration. While glycolysis and the citric acid cycle contribute to the direct production of 2 and 2 ATP molecules, respectively, these stages also contribute indirectly by generating high-energy electron carriers, which ultimately produce the highest ATP yield through the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

They are reading fewer novels, comics, magazines and websites, according to a National Literacy Trust study of 21,000 children and teenagers. While many enjoyed reading, some 17% said they would be embarrassed if a friend saw them with a book. A government spokesman said the findings showed the need to help young people develop a love of reading. Half of those questioned said they enjoyed reading very much, or quite a lot, almost the same as in 2005 when the figure was 51%. But the findings showed that just three in every 10 youngsters read daily in their own time, down from four in 10 in 2005. More than a fifth (22%) said they rarely or never read in their own time and more than half (54%) said they preferred watching television to reading. In 2005 more than three quarters (77%) of children read magazines, but now only 57% do. Comic reading has dropped from 64% to 50%, and reading on websites from 54% to 50%. The researchers said the figures highlighted \\"a clear issue with children's leisure time with many children enjoying reading but pushing it out in favour of other activities\\". Jonathan Douglas, director of National Literacy Trust, said: \\"The fact that children are reading less than in 2005 signals a worrying shift in young people's literacy habits. We are calling for the Government to back a campaign to halt this reading decline and to give children time to read in their daily lives. \\"We need to make reading irresistible. We want to call on families and professionals working with children and young people to make ten minutes in their day for reading.\\" The report said it was \\"essential\\" for children to make time to read because reading outside lessons was linked to strong academic achievement. It added that young people who read outside class on a daily basis were 13 times more likely to read above the expected level for their age. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \\"The findings of this survey come as no surprise and shows that we need to continue our drive to encourage young people to develop a love of reading. In a world of so many distractions for young minds, the place of literature is more important than ever. \\"Children need to master the basics of reading as early as possible in primary school so they can then go on to explore magical and powerful books such as Private Peaceful, Harry Potter, and, in good time, books such as Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm and those by Charles Dickens. \\"That's why we've introduced a short and simple phonics check at the end of Year 1 to make sure children have mastered the basics.\\" The study, which coincides with International Literacy Day on Saturday, comes as the World Literacy Foundation called on world leaders to tackle a global literacy crisis. Chief executive Andrew Kay said: \\"Globally, almost 800 million people are illiterate and 100 million children don't attend school each day\\".

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: \\"What solution is West offering and how is it different for a plaintiff from what is already being practiced?\\" Answer: \\"The minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer provided does not correctly address the question. The question asks what solution Valerie West is offering and how it is different for a plaintiff. Let me provide the correct answer. Answer: Valerie West's solution is to allow a custody order to stand for the full term of the PFA, which is up to 18 months, like it does in many other counties in the state. This is different from the current practice in Schuylkill County, which requires a custody order to be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.

The countless arrays of genera imply that each type of dinosaur had unique behavioral and biological characteristics that set them apart from the rest. Some, such as the Velociraptor, were small, fast, and more suited to hunting in packs, whereas others, like the gargantuan Argentinosaurus, belonged to the genus that boasted some of the largest land animals ever to have lived. These dinosaurs live on today as fossils, petrified impressions of what was once a living, breathing organism, providing us with the essential keys to unlocking the mysteries of their existence. These organisms symbolize the immense diversity of life on our planet and the truth about nature's resilience and inventiveness in the face of changing climatic and environmental challenges. The various periods during which these organisms lived, spanning from the mid-Mesozoic era to the late Cretaceous period, were marked by significant geological and climatic changes. These periods saw drastic changes in the earth’s climate, from warm and humid to arid and cold, and these changes shaped the evolution of not just the dinosaurs but all life forms during those times. Therefore, when considering the dinosaurs, one is not merely looking at a specific genus or group of extinct creatures with a fossil record. On the contrary, it implies a comprehensive study of organisms that once roamed the planet during different periods. Understanding them provides unique insight into adaptability and evolution, monumental climatic shifts, and the intricate dance of life and extinction that shapes our world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But among the instantly-recognisable faces of Royal Mail's 'Great Britons' stamp set is one that may leave you a little lost. John Archer, former Mayor or Battersea, is one of the characters featured in the set - a choice which is likely to leave some stamp collectors a little confused. Pioneer: John Archer, Mayor of Battersea, was the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London. For while his achievements heading up a London borough are indeed admirable, they are not quite as well-known as those of his fellow countrymen. The set of 10 first class stamps, released today, also includes David Lloyd George, Benjamin Britten and Vivien Leigh. Royal Mail said it aimed to include people in sport, journalism, music, politics and the arts whose anniversaries of birth fall in 2013. A spokesman said that the unconventional choice of Mr Archer recognised the contribution he made to public life as 'the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London'. First class Britons: Others featured on the stamps are photographer Norman Parkinson, actress Vivien Leigh, actor Peter Cushing, David Lloyd George, writer Elizabeth David, composer and pianist Benjamin Britten, archeologist Mary Leakey, footballer Bill Shankly and broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. Inspiration: John Archer was elected into Battersea Borough Council in 1906. Also part of the set are actress Vivien Leigh, famous for her leading roles in Gone with the Wind, and actor Peter Cushing. From the world of sport, Scottish footballer and manager William 'Bill' Shankly features for his triumph as First Division champions in 1964, 1966 and 1973. Notable figures from the world of politics are also featured with the first and only Welsh Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. One of the UK's best loved classical composers Benjamin Britten is included in the ten, with celebrated portrait and fashion photographer Norman Parkinson bolstering the arts contingent. There is also Richard Dimbleby, the well known journalist, and cookery writer Elizabeth David, who was credited with introducing post-war Britain to 'exotic' Mediterranean cooking. Completing the ten is eminent archaeologist and anthropologist, Mary Leakey, who was credited with forcing scientists to re-think their long held views on human evolution thanks to her significant discoveries. Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail Stamps spokesperson, said: 'We are delighted to be honouring some of the UK's most distinguished figures in history through our latest special stamp collection. 'We hope the stamps will serve as a lasting tribute to their memory and once again encourage people to remember their significant contribution to our Great British way of life.'","completion":"This article is about a special set of 10 stamps called \\"Great Britons\\" which has pictures of famous people from Britain.

It's worth mentioning that Cyrillic script is used in various languages, such as Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian, among others.

If you are looking for the word \\"patel\\" in English, it is a common Indian surname, particularly among Gujaratis and people from the Indian state of Gujarat. The name \\"Patel\\" is derived from the Gujarati term \\"patidar,\\" which is a combination of two words, \\"pati\\" (meaning land or farm) and \\"dar\\" (meaning ownership or possession).

The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Henry Ford grew up on an un-electrified farm, and as a young man he followed Edison's career as the inventor became a national role model.Ford took a job at the Edison Illuminating Company working his way up to chief engineer. In 1896 Ford was thirty-three and, though still working for Edison Co.,he had created his first experimental automobile the Ford Quadricycle2 during his off-time. At an Edison company party in New York, Ford had his first chance to meet his hero Edison and was able to explain his new automobile to the great inventor. _ Young man, that's the thing! You have it! Your car is self-contained and carries its own power plant.\\" Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one. The words comforted Ford greatly, who immediately set out building a second car which was to become the Model-T.6.The two men became f'ast friends and would go on camping trips together.When Edison later became limited to a wheelchair, Ford brought an extra one to his house so they could race.At the 50th anniversary of the invention of light-bulb, Ford honored Edison.When Edison spoke, he ended his speech directed at Ford:\\" As to Henry Ford, words fail to express my feelings.I can only say that he is my friend.\\" Therefore it is no surprise that Ford wanted something to remember Edison by after he passed away in 1931. Once, Ford asked Thomas Edison's son Charles to sit by the dying inventor's bedside and hold a test tube next to his father's mouth to catch his final breath. Ford was a man with many strange behaviors( as was Edison)including some interest in reanimation and spiritualism and some say that he was attempting to catch Edison's soul as it escaped his body in hopes of later bringing the inventor back to life. The test tube itself didn't turn up until 1950 when it was listed in the Ford possessions after Clara Ford's passing away, and then lost again until 1978 when it was discovered in an exhibit Entitled \\"Henry Ford-A Personal History\\" in the Henry Ford Museum.It would then be discovered that the tube was labeled \\"Edison's Last Breath\\". There is a further mystery of this \\"last breath\\" test tube. It would seem as if Edison had quite a last breath indeed, as the Edison Estate holds a collection of 42 test tubes all supposedly containing Edison's last breath. Regardless of the excitement over the last breath, the test tube is quite touching in its meaning.Although both men were known for all sorts of poor behavior towards .their loved ones and mistreatment of employees, between them at least, there was clearly a deep respect and admiration. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. When did Ford turn 33? 2. Where was he working? 3. Had Edison considered the gas engine as a vehicular power source? 4. What source had he considered? 5. Were Ford and Edison companions? 6. When did Edison die? 7. What do some people believe Ford tried to collect from Edison? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. Ford turned 33 in 1896. 2. He was working at the Edison Illuminating Company. 3. No, Edison had not considered the gas engine as a vehicular power source. 4.

Question: The Great Ocean Conveyer ocean current system runs north through the Atlantic from the equatorial region. If this current got disrupted, North American and European climates would become Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the role of The Great Ocean Conveyer ocean current system The Great Ocean Conveyer, also known as the thermohaline circulation, helps regulate Earth's climate by distributing heat around the planet. Warm water flows towards the poles, while cold water from the poles sinks and flows back towards the equator, creating a continuous cycle which helps to maintain a balanced temperature between different regions. Step 2: Identify the effects of a disrupted current If the Great Ocean Conveyer were disrupted, the movement of warm water towards the North American and European regions would be significantly reduced or halted. This would result in less heat being transported to these areas, which are already at higher latitudes. Step 3: Determine the consequences for North American and European climates Considering the reduction in heat transported to these regions, the climates of North America and Europe would likely be impacted. The most probable consequence would be a cooling effect and a shift towards colder conditions.

They learned a lot about sugars and chemistry. the bread making experiment was more successful and appreciated.than the beer experiment. Hint: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the bread making experiment using baker's yeast was more successful and appreciated than the beer experiment using brewer's yeast. We can deduce this from the statement, \\"the bread making experiment was more successful and appreciated than the beer experiment.\\" This suggests that the students had a better outcome and experience while baking bread as opposed to making beer. Additionally, the paragraph provides a detailed explanation about baker's yeast, which is a type of Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly used in baking bread and bakery products. As a leavening agent, it helps the bread rise, become lighter, and softer by converting fermentable sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. On the other hand, the paragraph mentions that brewer's yeast is also a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae but is primarily used for alcoholic fermentation. While both yeasts are similar in nature, their specific applications and purposes differ. In conclusion, the bread making experiment using baker's yeast was more successful and appreciated by the students due to its positive outcome, as well as the learning experience that was achieved related to sugars and chemistry. This could be attributed to the different properties and uses of baker's yeast in comparison to brewer's yeast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Halla , National 's chairman , president and CEO . \\" This deal makes sense for both companies , \\" Halla said in a prepared statement . Choose from: A. no B. yes...I think the answer is","completion":"B. yes. Both sentences are indicating the same thing, that the deal is advantageous or logical for both companies involved. The adjective “good” in the first statement acts as an intensifier of the noun “sense” but does not alter the core meaning of the statement. In the first sentence, Brian L. Halla is identified as the chairman, president, and CEO of \\"National\\". His statement suggests his opinion, in his roles as chairman, president, and CEO, that the deal positively benefits both companies. In the second sentence, Brian L. Halla is not specifically identified by his roles, but the use of just 'Halla' also refers to the same person. The fact that he made this statement in a prepared format suggests that he and possibly others have given thought to the deal, how it affects both companies, and their public response about it. Thus, regardless of whether his statement was made informally (in the first sentence) or as part of a prepared statement (in the second sentence), the essential meaning remains unchanged: he believes that the deal is beneficial or suitable for both companies. Additionally, in different contexts, the usage of \\"good\\" can amplify the positive impact of the deal or show a degree of enthusiasm from the speaker, but the central idea is still that the deal makes sense for both companies. If we remove the word \\"good,\\" the sentence still conveys the same fundamental meaning. However, it's important to note that while the overall meaning is the same, the nuances could be interpreted slightly different depending on the context. In informal speech or writing, the first sentence could be perceived as more enthusiastic or positive due to the use of the word \\"good\\". The second sentence, in a prepared statement, might be interpreted as more reserved or formal. Nevertheless, these are just nuances and do not affect the main message of the sentences, which remains the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yes or no? Answer: Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations ), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users. Question: how is a telephone pagers made A:","completion":"Yes, the provided answer gives a basic overview of how pagers work within a paging system. To expand on this and provide a more comprehensive understanding of how telephone pagers are made, let's explore the main components and the process involved in making a pager. A pager, also known as a beeper, is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. These are primarily used for on-site or wide-area communication purposes. Pagers became popular in the 1980s and 1990s but have since been largely replaced by mobile phones. However, they are still utilized in specific industries, such as healthcare, emergency services, and hospitality. Telephone pagers are made up of several key components: 1. Casing: The outer casing is usually made of plastic or a similar light-weight material to protect the pager's internal components and maintain durability. 2. Display: Pagers often incorporate small LCD or LED displays for showing alphanumeric messages. More modern pagers might include graphical screens. 3. Electronics: The main electronic components include a microcontroller, memory, radio frequency (RF) receiver/transmitter, and a buzzer or speaker for alarm notification. 4. Battery: Pagers are typically powered by small, replaceable batteries. These can be AA, AAA, or button cell batteries, depending on the size and power requirements of the device. 5. Antenna: A crucial component in the pager manufacturing process is the integration of an antenna, which receives signals from the paging system's transmitter/base station. The process of making a telephone pager involves assembling these components, integrating the hardware, and installing firmware. Here's a step-by-step outline of the process: 1. Design: Engineers design the electronic circuitry, casing, and antenna layout, usually using computer-aided design (CAD) software. 2. Manufacturing: The plastic casing is molded and the electronic components are assembled on a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB also holds the integrated circuits and other passive components. 3. Integration: The electronics, battery, and antenna are integrated into the casing, followed by the installation of the display. 4. Firmware and software: The microcontroller must be programmed with firmware. This software controls the pager's behavior, such as receiving and decoding signals, displaying messages, and managing user interaction. 5. Testing and quality control: Finally, each pager must be tested to ensure it functions correctly and meets all specified requirements. In summary, pagers operate as part of a paging system that includes fixed transmitters or base stations and multiple pager devices that users carry. The manufacturing process of a pager involves designing the casing, electronics, and antenna, assembling these components, programming the firmware, and performing thorough quality control checks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As hundreds of dead bodies start turning up along the Mexico border, and with law enforcement and government officials falling victim to its addictive properties as well, an old friend from the FBI manages to bribe the officials in Tijuana to let Dara back out onto the streets in order to bring down the drug lord and avenge her brother's murder.

In this statement, the speaker is expressing their agreement with the opinion or perspective of another person concerning the situation or circumstances faced by women. The condition of women may refer to various aspects of daily life, including but not limited to social, economic, political, and cultural factors. It may encompass the opportunities available to women, the challenges they face, and their overall status and role in society. It is essential to recognize that the condition of women is not the same universally. Indeed, their experiences and situations may differ significantly based on factors such as cultural background, geographic location, socio-economic status, education level, and family structure. Thus, it is important to analyze and address the diverse range of experiences and issues faced by women across different contexts. Some key components that can affect the condition of women include: 1. Gender equality: The level of gender equality present in various aspects of society can impact the condition of women. This may involve equal access to opportunities in areas like education, work, healthcare, and political representation. Gender stereotypes and socially ingrained gender roles can also hinder progress towards gender equality. 2. Economic empowerment: Women's economic empowerment is an essential factor in improving their condition. This can involve access to quality education, job opportunities, fair wages, and support for entrepreneurship. Economic empowerment enables women to have greater control over their own lives, make decisions, and contribute to the welfare of their communities and society as a whole. 3. Health and safety: Access to quality healthcare and a safe environment is crucial to the overall condition of women. This includes reproductive healthcare, access to family planning, protection from gender-based violence, proper nutrition, and mental health support. 4. Political representation: Women's involvement and representation in political processes play a significant role in addressing their issues and improving their condition. Greater political representation allows women to advocate for their rights, policies, and programs that benefit them and contribute to the overall development of society. 5. Cultural factors: Cultural norms, practices, and attitudes can significantly influence the condition of women. It is vital to challenge and change harmful cultural practices and beliefs that perpetuate gender inequality and undermine women's wellbeing and opportunities. In conclusion, to improve the condition of women and work towards a more gender-equitable society, it is crucial to address the various factors that influence their lives, within the context of their specific situations. Creating opportunities for education, economic empowerment, political representation, and healthcare while challenging cultural norms that perpetuate gender-based discrimination is vital in achieving this goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.kiwix.kiwixmobile. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Enjoy A World of Knowledge, With Some Room for Improvement Review: When it comes to offline knowledge access, the org.kiwix.kiwixmobile app truly stands out among the crowd. As someone who struggles with unreliable internet connections, I've found this app to be a very helpful resource. While it may not be perfect, it offers an impressive range of content in an accessible format. I would like to give it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Step 1: Opening the app welcomes you with an intuitive user interface, which makes navigation a breeze. This design choice allows users to focus on searching and consuming the content they need without any unnecessary confusion. Step 2: Accessing and downloading content is a straightforward process. Users can choose from an extensive library of resources such as Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, and various learning platforms. This feature makes it an absolute treasure trove of information. Step 3: It's also impressive to see how the app efficiently compresses the file sizes, allowing you to store more content on your device. This is particularly helpful for those using smartphones with limited storage capacity. However, I believe there is still some room for improvement: Step 4: The search feature could use an upgrade. Sometimes, the results may not be as accurate as one would hope, complicating the process of finding specific information. Enhancing the search functionality would significantly improve user experience. Step 5: Another area with potential for improvement is the app's download speed. Downloading large files, such as entire language packages, can take a considerable amount of time. Addressing this issue would make using the app an even more seamless experience. Finally, while the org.kiwix.kiwixmobile app may not be perfect, it provides a valuable service for those seeking offline access to a wealth of knowledge. With some fine-tuning and updates, it has the potential to be a 5-star app."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv.[citation needed] Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River. At the same time an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism.[citation needed] The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order.[citation needed] The affairs became even more complicated by the end of the 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare. On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first federal council of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv]in the city of Liubech with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.[citation needed] Output:","completion":"What was the primary objective of the first federal council of Kievan Rus held in 1097 near Chernihiv in the city of Liubech?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? flawless film ,","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"flawless film,\\" is positive. This is because the choice of words and the underlying message give a positive impression about the film being discussed. Breaking the sentence down, we can observe the following: 1. The word \\"flawless\\" is an adjective that means something is without any flaws or imperfections. In this context, it refers directly to the film, suggesting that the person who made this statement believes the film is perfect or of exceptionally high quality. The word conveys a strong positive sentiment as it leaves little to no room for criticism, thus indicating the speaker's admiration or high appreciation of the film. 2. The word \\"film\\" is a neutral noun, simply describing the medium of art or entertainment being discussed. It does not inherently hold a positive or negative sentiment but derives its sentiment from the accompanying adjective – in this case, \\"flawless.\\" Considering the sentence as a whole, it is evident that it conveys a positive sentiment. The film is being praised with a strong, positive adjective, which ultimately indicates the speaker's positive feelings and admiration for the film in question. This positive sentiment may lead readers or listeners to feel inclined to watch and appreciate the film themselves, as it has been endorsed with such a high level of praise."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},E={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
