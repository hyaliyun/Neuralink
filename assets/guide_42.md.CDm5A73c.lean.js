Raven Is Randy favorite character in the cartoon Matthew hates to watch,","completion":"Raven is Randy's favorite character in the cartoon Matthew hates to watch, much to the surprise of their friends who cannot understand the stark contrast in their preferences. Randy, an avid fan of the show, never misses an episode and often mentions the captivating storylines that surround Raven, a mysterious and powerful character with an intriguing backstory. He believes that the character's complexity, impressive abilities, and the emotional depth demonstrated through her interactions with other characters make Raven the absolute best part of the cartoon. Randy's appreciation for Raven extends beyond the screen, as he also collects comics, action figures, and other memorabilia featuring her likeness. On the other hand, Matthew simply cannot understand the fascination or appeal of the cartoon. He has tried watching it on multiple occasions, hoping to see what his friend Randy admires so much, but he finds it difficult to connect with the characters or appreciate the plotlines. The animation style is also not to his liking, which contributes to his overall disdain for the show. This difference in opinion between the two friends often leads to friendly debates, with each side attempting to validate their viewpoint and convince the other. However, despite these differing opinions, they respect each other's right to enjoy (or not enjoy) the cartoon in their own way. The key to their friendship is the understanding that, despite their contrasting taste in entertainment, they both hold valid opinions and can coexist in harmony. As time goes on, the friends continue to explore new shows, movies, and other forms of media together, with some becoming shared interests and others remaining singular passions. While it's likely that neither Randy nor Matthew will ever fully convince the other of the merits of their favorite (or least favorite) cartoon, their mutual respect allows them to continue engaging in these discussions and expanding their exposure to differing opinions and perspectives. In conclusion, the sentence ends by highlighting the difference in preferences between Randy and Matthew, emphasizing their contrasting opinions and emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and understanding in their friendship despite these differences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus): These are domesticated birds and hold huge economic value for people around the globe. People consume both chicken meat and eggs. Chickens are the most common type of poultry worldwide. 2. Quails (Coturnix spp.): These are small-sized birds raised for their meat and eggs. Different species, such as the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), are bred for commercial farming. 3. Turkeys (Meleagris spp.): Turkeys are large birds native to North America and also domesticated for their meat. Commercial turkey production has increased significantly over the years, especially in the United States. The two primary species are domesticated turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata). The Anseriformes order includes birds commonly known as \\"waterfowl.\\" Select members from the Anatidae family, such as ducks and geese, are also raised for their meat, eggs, and feathers. 1. Domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus): Ducks are aquatic birds that are commercially grown for their flavorful meat and eggs. Duck farming is widely prevalent, particularly in Asia. 2. Domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus): Geese are also raised as poultry, mainly for their meat and down, which is used for insulation in jackets, bedding, and pillows. Goose farming varies in scale, ranging from small-scale backyard operations to larger commercial establishments.

Being in a relationship with someone who sulks can, over time, damage your own self-confidence and wellbeing, making you wonder if you’re to blame. It’s not your fault—your partner is responsible for fixing their own behaviour, not you. Essentially, your partner needs to learn how to soothe and “parent” themselves before they’re able to be in a healthy relationship. It can be hard not to respond in anger or by sulking yourself, but work on staying open to communication. Tell them that coming to you directly and talking about it is perfectly fine—and you’re much more likely to respond in a loving way if they talk about it rather than sulk about it. If they’re finally able to sit down and talk about the problem, encourage them to tell you what triggered this response and how they felt. For example, they might say “You were half an hour late to dinner, which made me feel like you didn’t care” or “I saw you laughing and talking to another man, which made me think that you like him instead of me. I was jealous.” This may feel unnatural at first because it’s a very vulnerable and straightforward manner of communication. However, once your significant other starts talking to you this way, you’ll be able to address the problem much more easily. If your significant other is still struggling with this or is becoming more and more controlling, look into getting professional help through counselling. Go through the counselling process can help your partner realize that sulking hurts both themself and the people around them. Counselors can give you some advanced techniques for dealing with this behaviour as well. A couples therapist may even see both of you separately to help determine the source of the issue for both partners. The counselor can then help you work through individual issues. If your partner can’t break this pattern of behaviour or if your relationship has become unhealthy, a counselor can also help you evaluate whether or not you should stay together. To find a good couples therapist, ask your doctor for a recommendation or check online at websites like the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy or GoodTherapy.org. if you don’t see any changes. If you’ve made it clear that this behaviour is unacceptable and you still don’t see any changes in your lover’s behaviour, it’s probably time to go your separate ways. It is not your responsibility to continually validate their immaturity, jealousy, and insecurity. That isn’t fair to you or healthy for either party. Because your partner is already prone to bad behaviour like sulking, the process of breaking up may be extra difficult and emotional. For a safe and healthy breakup, be respectful but firm. Tell your partner why you want to break up and set clear boundaries. For example, you could say “I can’t stay in this relationship if you can’t communicate with me when you’re upset. It seems like you have some emotional issues to work through, and I wish you all the best, but we need to go our separate ways.”","completion":"In a relationship with a partner who often sulks, it is important to recognize that it is not your responsibility to fix their behavior, but rather, they need to learn to manage their emotions and effectively communicate their feelings. Continuous sulking can negatively impact your self-confidence and well-being, so it is crucial to encourage open communication and allow your partner to express their feelings, even if it feels vulnerable at first. This can lead to a better understanding of underlying issues and enable you to address problems more effectively. If your partner struggles with this type of behavior or becomes controlling, consider seeking professional help through couples counseling. A therapist can offer advanced techniques to address the issue and may work with both partners separately to identify the root cause.

If you have made it clear that your partner's behavior is unacceptable and there are no changes, it may be time to consider ending the relationship. Breaking up with a partner who is prone to sulking can be challenging and emotional.

Choices: - toy store - basement - school - rest area - building The rationale to choose \\"rest area\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The rationale to choose \\"rest area\\" as the answer is based on several factors that make it the most suitable and convenient option for John's specific needs related to his RV's electricity requirements for cooking lunch. 1. Availability of amenities: Rest areas are designated locations usually found along highways or major roads, specifically designed to provide a range of facilities and amenities for travelers and their vehicles. These facilities generally include restrooms, picnic tables, drinking water, and crucially, electrical hookups for RVs and other large vehicles. This would make it an ideal place for John to get the electricity he needs to cook lunch in his RV. 2. Convenience for RV users: Rest areas are intentionally designed to accommodate a variety of vehicle types, including RVs. Typically, these areas have large parking spaces and easy access from the main roads, making it convenient for John to maneuver his RV and find a suitable spot to plug in. 3. Safety and cleanliness: Rest areas are maintained by highway authorities or local governments, which means they follow certain standards of hygiene and safety. This ensures that John can confidently plug in his RV and use the electricity to cook without worrying about potential safety hazards. 4. Cost efficiency: Many rest areas offer free or relatively low-cost electrical hookups for RVs compared to private RV parks or campgrounds. This would be a practical and wallet-friendly option for John to get the electricity needed for cooking his lunch. 5. Traveler-oriented services: As rest areas cater to the needs of travelers, they often have additional services such as tourist information, vending machines, and waste disposal facilities. These services can contribute to making John's overall travel experience more pleasant and enjoyable. In contrast, the other choices like toy stores, basements, schools, or generic buildings are not specifically designed to cater to the electricity needs of RV users, nor do they have designated spaces for parking and plugging in RVs. They could also present restrictions, safety concerns, or difficulties in terms of access and security for John and his RV. Therefore, based on the factors listed above, the \\"rest area\\" is the most appropriate choice for John to plug in his RV, as it provides him with the necessary electricity to cook lunch while also ensuring the safety, convenience, and cost-efficiency he requires for a comfortable and enjoyable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Premise: Two people standing in tree on a sunny day Hypothesis: two boys have climbed a tree Update: The boys can see very far ahead. Output:","completion":"To complete this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Read the premise: Two people standing in a tree on a sunny day. 2. Understand the given situation: There are two people in a tree, and it's a sunny day. 3. Read the hypothesis: Two boys have climbed a tree. 4. Understand the assumption: The two people in the tree might be boys. 5. Read the update: The boys can see very far ahead. 6. Consider how the update affects the hypothesis: Does it make it more likely (strengthener) or less likely (weakener) to believe that the two people in the tree are boys? 7. In this case, the update is neutral, neither a strengthener nor a weakener, because it does not provide any information that would make you more or less likely to believe that the two people in the tree are boys. Seeing far ahead is an ability that does not depend on the gender of the individuals. However, since you need to choose between strengthener and weakener, you could consider the update as a subtle strengthener. The fact that they can see very far could imply that they chose a high branch to climb, a behavior more commonly associated with boys. But keep in mind that this reasoning is not strong enough, and the update is not a definitive strengthener of the hypothesis. Output: strengthener"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. Question: suppose less leaves fall on the ground happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To fully understand the relationship between the decrease in fallen leaves and the effect on the burning mass of a red giant, we must first examine each part of the scenario separately. First, let's consider the process of a red giant star. A typical red giant star goes through several stages during its lifetime. Initially, it burns hydrogen at its core, fusing it into helium. As the hydrogen fuel becomes depleted, the star contracts and the core temperature increases. At some point, the helium begins to burn, fusing into carbon and oxygen. With the decrease in mass, the remaining helium ignites in a shell around the core. This process causes the outer layers of the red giant to expand. Eventually, the mass decreases to the point where the star can no longer withstand the gravitational forces, and the outer layers vanish. This leaves behind a dense core called a white dwarf. Now let's look at the situation involving the fallen leaves. For the sake of this hypothetical, we will assume that the decrease in fallen leaves is a direct result of a reduced amount of photosynthesis occurring in plant life. Photosynthesis has an impact on the carbon cycle, which in turn affects the broader ecosystem and the chemical processes that occur within it, including the elements available for stellar fusion. Understanding these separate processes, we can now answer the question of how less leaves falling on the ground will affect the mass burning in a red giant. Lesser leaves mean that less carbon dioxide is being absorbed by plant life through photosynthesis. This reduction will eventually cause a minor but noticeable shift in the balance of elements in the environment, including the availability of carbon. Since carbon fusion is a critical part of the red giant's life cycle as it transitions from burning helium to the eventual, inevitable collapse into a white dwarf, a decrease in the availability of carbon in the stellar environment would mean that the red giant's remaining mass would burn at a slower rate. Consequently, it will take longer for the star to reach the point at which it can no longer continue the fusion process (resulting in shedding its outer layers and contracting into a white dwarf). In conclusion, a decrease in the number of fallen leaves, which indicates a decrease in the carbon dioxide absorption by plant life through photosynthesis, would ultimately affect the availability of carbon, thus causing a red giant to burn mass at a slower rate. This supports the answer \\"B: Less.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: Do athletes live longer and healthier? If not, why? Second question: Health: Why is it desirable to live a longer, healthier life? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"First question: Do athletes live longer and healthier? If not, why? Athletes generally tend to live longer and healthier lives compared to non-athletes, but there are some factors to consider. There are several reasons behind this difference, including: 1. Physical Fitness: Athletes typically engage in regular exercise, leading to better cardiovascular health, lower body weight, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. These factors contribute to a longer and healthier life. 2. Healthier Lifestyle: Athletes are more likely to maintain a healthier lifestyle by consuming nutrient-rich diets, sleeping adequately, and avoiding substance abuse such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake. A balanced diet and good nutrition are essential factors that contribute to longevity and overall health. 3. Mental Health: Physical activity and sports participation have been found to have positive effects on mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, athletes often have a strong sense of discipline and goal-setting, which can contribute to better mental health and resilience. However, there are some downsides to being an athlete: 1. Injuries: Athletes, particularly those who participate in contact sports or high-impact activities, are more prone to injuries. These injuries can lead to long-term health issues, chronic pain, or even early retirement from sports. 2. Overtraining: Some athletes may push their bodies too far, resulting in overtraining syndrome. This can cause hormonal imbalances, decreased immunity, and increased risk of injury, which could affect an athlete's overall health and well-being. Second question: Health: Why is it desirable to live a longer, healthier life? Living a longer, healthier life is desirable because it allows individuals to experience a higher quality of life, enjoy more opportunities and experiences, and maintain their independence as they age. There are several reasons why longevity and health are valued: 1. Enhanced Quality of Life: A longer and healthier life allows people to engage in activities they enjoy, maintain strong social connections, and contribute to their communities. Optimal health enables individuals to minimize or avoid physical limitations and chronic illnesses, providing a greater sense of well-being and happiness. 2. Increased Opportunities and Experiences: Living a longer, healthier life opens doors to new opportunities, experiences, and personal growth. Whether it's traveling, pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or continuing to learn and develop new skills, good health gives people the chance to make the most of their time. 3. Financial Stability: By maintaining good health, individuals may be able to work longer, delay retirement, and reduce medical expenses associated with chronic diseases or disability. In turn, this can contribute to financial stability and peace of mind as they age. 4. Family and Social Connections: Living a longer, healthier life allows individuals to support and spend more time with their families, develop strong intergenerational relationships, and maintain social connections as they age. These relationships promote a sense of belonging and enhance mental well-being. To answer your last query, these two questions are not necessarily asking the same thing. The first question is about the longevity and health of athletes compared to non-athletes, while the second question focuses on the desirability of living a longer, healthier life in general. Although there is some overlap between the questions, they address different aspects of health and longevity. Therefore, the answer is: [-] no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several indicators in the text that signal the reviewer's strong disapproval and dissatisfaction with the product, which in this case is an album by the artist Noreaga, titled \\"God's Favorite.\\" First, the title of the review, \\"Is this guy kidding me?\\" establishes a negative tone right away. It suggests that the reviewer is in disbelief and frustration with the album, which they implied by asking rhetorically if the artist is joking with the content they produced. Several phrases and words throughout the review convey the extent of the reviewer's negative opinion on the album. They describe Noreaga as \\"straight up wack\\" and further emphasize that they've never written any other reviews saying \\"bad stuff\\" about an artist before, indicating that this instance was strong enough to warrant their criticism in a way other artists have not. The reviewer also notes that even though Noreaga's previous works were also \\"wack,\\" they could at least find some humor in the lyrics. However, they claim that in \\"God's Favorite,\\" the rhymes are no longer funny and therefore provide no redeemable qualities for the listener. The repetition of the word \\"wack\\" to describe both the artist and their work emphasizes the negative perspective, as \\"wack\\" is slang for low quality or unimpressive. In addition to the lyrics, the reviewer criticizes the album's beats, also calling them \\"wack.\\" They then make a direct appeal to other potential listeners, urging them not to support the album. This further solidifies the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to dissuade others from giving it their attention or money. Finally, they specifically mention the worst song on the album in their view, \\"Mr. CEO.\\" By drawing attention to this particular track, the reviewer is emphasizing their overall dissatisfaction with the album.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with the Russian-born novelistâwho eventually became a member of Freud's 'Vienna Circle'-- Lou Andreas-Salome (Katheryn Winnick) who had an unconsummated (Platonic) 'love affair' with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (Armand Assante), and to whom he allegedly proposed in 1882 (although whether her claims are true is very much up for debate) writing a letter to Dr Josef Breuer (Ben Cross), after hearing of his newly developed talking cure (Breuer was a friend of Sigmund Freud (Jamie Elman), who also appears in the story, and one of the influential fathers of psychoanalysis.). The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own. So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must \\"treat\\" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim (played by Michal Yannai), otherwise known as Anna O., a...

It leaves room for the enigmatic Lou Andreas-Salome, who plays a critical role in initiating the chain of events that binds these lives with a common thread. \\"Echoes\\" implies a lingering aftermath of individual experiences, symbolizing Nietzsche's migraines and the emotional pain from Salome's rejection, Breuer's despair from being in love with his patient, and even Freud's attempts to steer through these convolutions. This word represents the motifs of psychoanalysis and philosophy that echo throughout the narrative. \\"Despair\\" encompass the primary psychological motif and is the tie that binds the main characters together.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who continued to send troops to Béxar? from the following article ? By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W.

Step 1: Research the costs of incarceration Incarceration involves imprisoning individuals convicted of crimes. Associated costs include the construction and maintenance of prison facilities, staffing, security measures, inmate meals, healthcare, and other expenses related to operating a penitentiary. Various studies have shown that the average cost per inmate per year in the United States is estimated to be around 31,000, although this figure can vary widely between states (Vera Institute of Justice, 2015). Step 2: Investigate the costs of rehabilitation programs Rehabilitation takes several forms, including drug and alcohol treatment programs, educational courses, job training, mental health treatment, and therapy or counseling. Assessing the costs of rehabilitation requires considering the costs of implementing and operating these various programs and the potential reduction in crime that may result from participation in these programs. Some studies have shown that rehabilitation programs can cost as low as 5,000 per participant annually (Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2019). Step 3: Compare the costs and effectiveness of incarceration and rehabilitation A comparison of costs and effectiveness should take into account both the direct expenses and potential long-term outcomes associated with each approach. Studies have suggested that rehabilitation programs can be more cost-effective than incarceration, particularly in reducing rates of recidivism (the likelihood of a person re-offending). For example, a meta-analysis conducted by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2019) found that individuals participating in rehabilitation programs had a significantly lower rate of recidivating, which in turn led to long-term cost savings for the criminal justice system. Thus, the evidence supporting the claim that incarceration is expensive while rehabilitation is not includes: 1. The higher average annual cost of incarceration compared to rehabilitation programs. 2. The demonstrated effectiveness of rehabilitation programs in reducing recidivism rates, leading to long-term cost savings for the criminal justice system. While the specific cost savings of rehabilitation may fluctuate based on geographic location and year, the overall trends in research suggest that it is a less expensive and more effective approach to reducing crime than incarceration alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The vacuum that I bought was a lot better than the simple broom, because the","completion":"vacuum cleaner offered numerous advantages that significantly improved the overall cleaning experience, making it more efficient, effective, and convenient compared to using a simple broom. Firstly, the vacuum's powerful suction capabilities allowed it to remove dirt, dust, and debris from various surfaces more effectively, ensuring a deeper and more thorough cleaning. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with allergies, as the vacuum effectively captures allergens like dust mites, pet dander, and pollen, reducing the likelihood of allergic reactions. In addition, vacuum cleaners are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which trap microscopic particles and maintain clean air quality within the home. This feature is extremely important for those who suffer from asthma, allergies, or other respiratory issues, as it prevents the spread of harmful contaminants in the air. Moreover, the vacuum cleaner's versatility allows it to be used on a wider range of surfaces, such as carpets, hardwood floors, tile, and even upholstery. Most vacuums come with a variety of attachments, designed to help reach tight spaces, clean curtains, and easily pick up pet hair. This added functionality not only saves time but also improves the overall cleanliness of the home. In terms of convenience and ease of use, vacuum cleaners often come with features that make them user-friendly and easy to maintain. For example, most vacuums have a bagless design, eliminating the need to purchase and replace vacuum bags continuously. Instead, a simple dustbin can be detached, emptied, and reattached quickly and efficiently. Regarding ergonomics and user comfort, vacuum cleaners often come with height-adjustable handles, making it comfortable to use for people of varying heights. Furthermore, many vacuums have relatively long power cords, allowing the user to clean larger areas without having to switch power outlets constantly. Another important aspect to consider is the time and energy saved when using a vacuum cleaner compared to a broom. Sweeping with a broom can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially when trying to remove dirt from carpets and rugs. However, vacuums efficiently suck up the debris, reducing the time spent on cleaning tasks and leaving the user with more time for other activities. Lastly, vacuum cleaners contribute to better overall hygiene within the home. Since brooms often only push dirt around or even into the air, certain allergens and bacteria can remain in the living space. In contrast, vacuums are designed to contain dirt and debris, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination and significantly reducing the spread of germs and allergens. In conclusion, the vacuum cleaner I bought was a lot better than the simple broom, because it provided enhanced cleaning capabilities, improved air quality, versatility, convenience, comfort, and better overall hygiene. These features make the vacuum cleaner an indispensable tool for maintaining a clean and healthy living environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Apparently the cat loved Monica more than Christine because the cat would love bite","completion":"Monica every now and then, but never Christine. It was quite fascinating to observe the different ways in which their furry friend expressed love and affection towards the two women. Monica, always an animal lover, cherished their little cat and believed that her bond with the feline was truly unique. Christine, on the other hand, couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy each time she witnessed this display of love between Monica and the cat. The love bites that the cat bestowed upon Monica were gentle, playful nibbles, a sign that their cat was comfortable and trusting in her presence. It was a behavioral quirk observed among felines when they felt secure and happy with their human companion. They would occasionally nibble on their loved one's skin, careful not to cause any actual pain, to exhibit their feelings. Monica felt incredibly grateful to have earned the cat's trust and love, given how notoriously picky felines could be when it came to forming connections with humans. Christine began to wonder why the cat did not give her the same love bites that it showered upon Monica. She tried various tactics to get closer to her furry companion, but none seemed to produce the same level of intimacy that her partner enjoyed. From buying the cat's favorite treats to gifting it new toys every now and then, Christine went out of her way to demonstrate her love and attentiveness. She even tried mimicking Monica's actions, hoping to trigger a similar response from the cat. Over time, Christine started to realize that perhaps it was not the cat's preference for Monica that was causing this discrepancy but rather her own approach to bonding with their feline friend. Whereas Monica spent time genuinely engaging with the animal and forming a bond based on trust, Christine's attempts were mostly rooted in a competitive desire to win the cat's love. Her intentions and actions were less genuine, which the cat could inherently sense. As their understanding of the situation evolved, Monica and Christine decided to work on deepening their bond with the cat together. They learned how to approach the cat as a unit, each respecting the other's differences in interacting with their feline companion. They acknowledged that forming a loving bond with the cat didn't hinge on receiving love bites but rather on cultivating a relationship rooted in trust and understanding. In time, Christine found her own unique way to bond with the cat. Instead of love bites, she was rewarded with gentle head butts and purring, as the cat chose to display its affection differently towards her. Eventually, both Monica and Christine celebrated their unique and special connections with the cat, realizing that love and trust could manifest in more than one way. The cat, Monica, and Christine continued to grow together, cherishing the distinct relationships they shared with one another. Each of them contributed to the loving atmosphere within their little family, even if the ways in which they expressed their love may have been different. It became a beautiful lesson for them all on the different forms that love can take and the importance of acknowledging and appreciating those differences within any relationship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music Editor's note: Mark Coleman is the author of \\"Playback: From the Victrola to MP3, 100 Years of Music, Machines and Money.\\" (CNN) -- The cassette tape is back! Or at least this is what the organizers of Cassette Store Day -- that's right, it's today -- would have us believe. Cassettes? Really? Let's play along, if only for nostalgia's sake. Fifty years after the prototype cassette was introduced at the 1963 Berlin Radio Show, a group of independent labels that release new cassettes have pulled together the global event celebrating and, they hope, stimulating the resurgence of prerecorded tapes. The day will be observed, according to the group's website, at roughly 100 retail stores and music venues in the U.S., Europe, Canada and South America, with tie-ins, new cassette releases and live performers pushing new tapes. Cassette releases from established bands like At the Drive-In and Flaming Lips will be vended, as well as tapes from underground artists like Grape Soda and Gold Bears on the Hope for the Tape Deck label. Anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self-destructed in the tape deck or having to insert index finger or pen into the cassette in a usually vain attempt to rewind the hopelessly twisted tape must be asking a simple question: Why? In the seamless age of digital music, when seemingly every song ever recorded is available at the stroke of a few computer keys, why would anyone revive such a clunky and outmoded physical format? But consider: Even with the convenience and sheer abundance of music stored on MP3 files, cassettes (and vinyl) offer tangible and tactile pleasures that aren't readily available in the digital world. There's a sizable, and growing, subset of consumers who lust for musical objects that they can hold in their hands (and their hearts) as well as their ears. Anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self-destructed in the tape deck ... must be asking a simple question: Why? \\"Metal and punk and noise people never stopped releasing cassettes,\\" says Scott Seward. He is a music critic and owner of John Doe Jr. Used Records and Books in Greenfield, Massachusetts. \\"Fans of that music have always collected tapes. Same with jam band and Grateful Dead fans until recent years. It's still a common format for a lot of Middle Eastern, Indian and Asian street or folk music too, because cassettes are so cheap to reproduce.\\" It's true. Cassettes have always been an alternative and were for many years something of an underdog in the musical format wars. Not long after prerecorded cassettes emerged in the vinyl-dominated marketplace, the 8-track tape format eclipsed them in popularity. That was largely because the Ford Motor Co. started offering 8-track players as an option on some of its cars beginning in 1966. The automobile would power sales of the 8-track format past the cassette in the music-mad '60s and '70s. Drivers could insert and remove the bulky 8-tracks with one hand. By 1975, incredibly, 8-track tapes were second only to vinyl records in terms of sales figures. Cassettes had already been a tough sell to audiophiles because until the advent of Dolby noise reduction in the '70s, their sound quality was muffled compared with vinyl records. Gradually that improved, just as new tape playback options emerged. Even before the Walkman, the portable stereos known as boom boxes boosted the popularity of cassettes in the urban areas where these hulking radio/tape players (aka ghetto blasters) were most often used. Boom boxes made music consumption a public event (often whether the public wanted it or not) while advancing the notion of portability. But consumers began to demand portable music players. In late 1979, Sony introduced the proto-Walkman. Retailing for 199, the Soundabout was a 14-ounce playback-only device that came with headphones and used standard-size cassettes. By 1981, the smaller and cheaper Walkman II was available. Hello, 80s? We miss you! When it comes to recorded music formats, portable equals personal. So it's no accident that the Walkman and similar devices became known as personal stereos in the early '80s. Soon, Walkman headphones were as ubiquitous as boom boxes on city streets. Thanks to the Walkman, the boom box and the cassette (and later the CD), sales of vinyl records plummeted during the '80s. In 1981, more than twice as many vinyl records as prerecorded cassettes were sold. By 1984, the numbers had flipped, and cassette sales outpaced vinyl for the first time. Despite the unsuccessful \\"Home Taping Is Killing Music\\" campaign of the early '80s, the ability to record one's own tapes was always a huge part of the cassette's appeal. Homemade mix tapes became a cultural touchstone for a generation (or two), functioning as diaries or journals and figuring in courtship rituals (see Rob Sheffield's affecting memoir \\"Love Is A Mix Tape\\"). When cassettes faded from the scene in the early '90s in the conquering wake of the CD, something unique -- personal -- got left behind. Gone, perhaps, but not forgotten. The pull of nostalgia is not the only motivation behind the recent cassette cult resurgence, but memories and recorded music are deeply -- some say neurologically -- intertwined. \\"There is that True Cult aspect,\\" Seward says. \\"It's an exclusivity thing. Cassettes just seem like a cooler thing to have for sale at your punk or noise show than a CDR. Black metal and power electronics sound fab on tape, though. Same with Miami bass music. I still listen to a lot of metal and rap on tape, and I make mix tapes from vinyl that sound amazing.\\" Even if Cassette Store Day fails to bring prerecorded cassettes back to commercial prominence, the event makes a telling point about our music consumption. Despite the digital revolution, if you dust off those outmoded physical formats like cassette tapes and vinyl records down in the basement, they produce more than memories: They play music. They still work. Their appeal, however sentimental, is stronger than mere nostalgia. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Coleman.

Please answer the following question: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. According to the above context, answer the following question. What promise did the president make? Choose your answer from: (A). not enough information (B). an increase in the defense budget (C). no spending on immigration (D). a large pay raise for the senate","completion":"From the context provided, the president, Donald Trump, made a couple of promises. However, based on the provided options, the relevant promise is (B). an increase in the defense budget. The context specifically states that the measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding. This corresponds to an increase in the defense budget. Additionally, the bill would provide a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel and a substantial budget increase for the military, both of which are part of increasing the defense budget. While there is also mention of his promise regarding funding for an immigration agenda, specifically the U.S.-Mexico border wall, this doesn't align with option (C). Moreover, there's no allusion to a pay raise for the Senate as in option (D). Thus, based on the text, the President's promise that aligns with the options given was to increase the defense budget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step is: Step 1: Human and natural activities produce greenhouse gas emissions. Justification of my steps: Step 1: It is important to understand how human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, as well as natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This introduction helps set the context for understanding the various processes that follow. Step 2: Engines produce carbon dioxide - Combustion of fossil fuels in engines, such as in automobiles or power plants, leads to the production of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Step 3: Living things produce waste - Living organisms create waste products (biomass) through their metabolic activities. Step 4: Waste decomposes - Decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down waste products (biomass) into simpler compounds. Step 5: Decomposition produces methane - As organic waste decomposes, methane, another potent greenhouse gas, is released as a byproduct of the process. Step 6: Water evaporates - Water on Earth's surface evaporates due to solar energy, forming water vapor in the atmosphere. Step 7: Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Water vapor is added to the Earth's atmosphere and becomes one of the most prevalent greenhouse gases. Step 8: Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases - These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and can lead to climate change."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Passage:Hibbard made his Broadway debut in Cats in 1993 in the role of the Rum Tum Tugger at the Winter Garden Theatre. Next was a Once Upon A Mattress revival in the role of the Jester, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Jane Krakowski, which opened on December 19, 1996, at the Broadhurst Theatre and ran for 188 performances.

Yaida first became well known when her first single (\\"Howling\\" which included the track \\"How?\\") was released in 2000 on Aozora records, an independent label pre-dominantly distributing to the Kansai area of Osaka only, and reportedly sold in excess of 10,000 copies. Widespread airplay on Osaka's local radio stations and word-of-mouth resulted in both Yaida and Aozora records becoming the focus of a bidding war between the larger record companies for both recording and distribution contracts, the final Japanese distributing rights being sold to Toshiba-EMI with Aozora retaining artist control and independent label status. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm.

This will set limitations, such as size, on your tattoo design. Think hard about whether you want the tattoo to be visible to everyone, in which case you can consider tattooing your arms or legs, or whether you want it to be more private, in which case you would want to consider tattooing your lower back, shoulders, or stomach. A larger or more intricate tattoo made with different sizes of needles will also likely hurt more, especially given that thicker needles tend to hurt more than thinner ones since they pierce more skin. Also keep in mind that different spots on the body have varying sensitivities. Bonier parts of the body and parts with little fat tend to be more painful. The wrists, for example, are highly sensitive, so it could hurt more to get inked there. Pain is subjective. Some claim that the initial outline of the tattoo is more painful, especially if this is your first experience getting inked, and others claim that the shading is more uncomfortable since the artist is going over the same areas over and over, packing color or ink. If you want to avoid shading, however, you should pick a simple, minimalistic tattoo design. Pain is part of the process, so prepare yourself. Remember that it's worth it-- you'll end up with a one-of-a-kind tattoo! Tattoo color can affect the design you create - color tattoos, for example, may be better suited for smaller designs so that you have fewer touch-ups to do. Black and gray tattoos age better than color tattoos over time, are typically less expensive, and take less time to complete. Color tattoos allow for more creativity, are great for covering existing tattoos, and contrast strongly with light to medium skin tones. Ask your tattoo artist for their recommendation on the type of coloring you should get. You might also want to consider getting a tattoo made out of white ink, depending on the type of design that you want to create and on the visibility you want the tattoo to have. White ink tattoos will often be less visible than monochrome or color ones.","completion":"When deciding where to get a tattoo, it is important to consider factors such as visibility, sensitivity, and discretion, as these factors will affect aspects like the size and design of your tattoo. You must determine whether you want your tattoo to be easily visible to others, in which case arms or legs are suitable locations, or if you prefer it to be more private, considering areas like the lower back, shoulders, or stomach. The type of tattoo and needles used can also influence pain levels during the tattooing process. Larger and more intricate tattoos may cause more discomfort, particularly when thicker needles are used, as they pierce a larger area of skin. Different body parts also have varying levels of sensitivity, causing certain areas, like the wrists, to be more painful than others. While some people find the initial outline of the tattoo to be more painful, others claim that shading causes more discomfort due to the repeated actions of the artist. If you want to minimize pain, you could opt for a simple, minimalistic tattoo design. Pain tolerance is subjective, and enduring discomfort is part of the tattooing experience. Ultimately, the process results in a unique and personal piece of body art. When it comes to selecting the colors for your tattoo, consider aspects such as maintenance, cost, and personal preferences. Black and gray tattoos tend to age better, are less expensive, and require less time to complete, while color tattoos offer more flexibility, are ideal for covering existing tattoos, and provide a strong contrast on lighter skin tones. It's advisable to consult with your tattoo artist for recommendations on the best coloring options for your design. Another option to explore is using white ink, which offers a unique appearance and is often less visible when compared to monochrome or color tattoos. Ultimately, the choice of design, size, placement, and color should reflect your personal preferences and desired level of visibility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the next sentence. William needed more wood this winter than Nick because Choose from: (1). William used less of it last year.; (2). Nick used less of it last year.;","completion":"William needed more wood this winter than Nick because Nick used less of it last year. This difference in wood consumption can be attributed to several factors that played a role in their individual usage patterns. While both William and Nick have similar sized houses and heating systems, their lifestyles and personal choices affected the quantity of firewood needed to heat their homes. Last year, Nick made a conscious effort to reduce his carbon footprint and turned to alternative methods of heating, such as investing in energy-efficient electric radiators and insulating his home better with high-quality insulation materials. Consequently, he managed to decrease his dependency on wood as a primary source of heat. Furthermore, Nick's flexible work schedule allowed him to spend more time away from home during the colder months, traveling to warmer climates. This resulted in less time spent at his house during winter and hence a lesser demand for wood to heat it. In contrast, William had a significantly different approach. He continued using wood as the main heating source due to its affordability and accessibility in their rural community. William considered electric heaters too expensive and impractical for his larger than average household. He also preferred the cozy ambiance that a wood fire creates, making it an essential part of his family's winter activities. Additionally, unlike Nick, William had a demanding full-time job in their town, which kept him at home during the winter months. Another factor contributing to the difference in wood consumption was the harshness of the previous winter. As William's house was located at a higher elevation, it was more exposed to the elements and faced much colder temperatures, resulting in an increased need for heating. Nick's home, being at a lower elevation, experienced milder winter conditions. This geographical variation further amplified the difference in their wood usage. Lastly, the social dynamics of their households played a role too. William often hosted large family gatherings and events during the winter, further increasing the need for more heating and thereby raising the demand for wood. On the other hand, Nick preferred to spend his time alone or with a smaller circle of friends, causing less strain on his heating resources. In conclusion, William needed more wood this winter than Nick because of a variety of factors. Nick's conscious efforts to reduce his carbon footprint and use alternative heating methods, his flexible work schedule that let him travel during the winter, the difference in their homes' elevation, and their contrasting social lifestyles all contributed to the disparity in firewood consumption between these two neighbors."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Fibroblasts were cultured from conjunctival specimens of healthy donors. Eosinophils were cultured on confluent monolayers of conjunctival fibroblasts or in culture medium alone. Eosinophil survival was evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion test. Eosinophil adherence was assessed by counting the attached cells after washing the cultures. Eosinophil viability and adherence in coculture were also assessed in the presence of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), anti-interleukin (IL)-3, and anti-IL-5 neutralizing antibodies. Cocultured eosinophils were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 4 days in culture, and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) release was determined as a marker of their activation.', 'Eosinophils cocultured with conjunctival fibroblasts had a significantly increased viability of 35.9% (P = 0.004) and 12.8% (P = 0.003) on days 4 and 8, respectively. Fibroblast-conditioned medium did not enhance the survival of eosinophils. The increase in eosinophil survival in coculture was partially inhibited by anti-GM-CSF (P = 0.019), anti-IL-3 (P = 0.033), or anti-IL-5 (P = 0.011), whereas eosinophil adherence was reduced by anti-GM-CSF alone (P = 0.034). LPS activation of eosinophils cultured for 4 days with conjunctival fibroblasts induced higher EPO release than in freshly isolated eosinophils (P = 0.01).Question: Do conjunctival fibroblasts enhance the survival and functional activity of peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro? Student:","completion":"Yes, according to the provided context, conjunctival fibroblasts enhance both the survival and functional activity of peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro. Eosinophils co-cultured with conjunctival fibroblasts significantly increased their viability on both days 4 and 8 post-treatment. This suggests that the presence of fibroblasts promotes longer survival of eosinophils. Furthermore, eosinophils cultured with fibroblasts demonstrated enhanced functional activity as they were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 4 days in culture, resulting in a higher release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), which was used as a marker of their activation. However, the increase in eosinophil survival was partially inhibited by antibodies against GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-5, and eosinophil adherence was reduced by anti-GM-CSF alone. It should be noted, though, that fibroblast-conditioned medium did not enhance eosinophil survival, indicating that direct contact or close proximity with the fibroblasts may be necessary for the enhancement effect."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options: - learn - keep score - try to win - fun - require time to be kept Explain why a human would choose \\"keep score\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"keep score\\" to answer the question above because keeping score is an effective way to determine the winner in most games. In many competitive activities and sports, the primary objective is to achieve a better result than the opponents, which is typically quantified through a scoring system. The process of keeping score involves recording and tracking points, goals, or other game-specific metrics that contribute to a player or team's overall standing. As the game progresses, the scores will change based on the players' performance and actions during the match. When the game reaches its conclusion, whether through the completion of all rounds, allotted time, or meeting victory conditions, the player/team with the highest score is determined to be the winner. This method allows for a transparent and objective way to determine the outcome of the competition. By comparing scores, participants can easily assess their performance and identify potential areas of improvement. Furthermore, keeping score creates a sense of accomplishment and adds an element of excitement to the game, making it more engaging and enjoyable for participants and spectators alike. While other options mentioned, such as learning, trying to win, and having fun, are essential aspects of playing games, they do not directly contribute to determining who wins in a game. Learning is a process that happens during gameplay, but it doesn't dictate the game's outcome. Similarly, trying to win should be every competitor's goal, but it doesn't help to figure out who actually wins. Lastly, having fun is a crucial aspect of playing games but does not relate to determining a winner. The option \\"require time to be kept\\" can be relevant in some games to control the match's duration, but it doesn't help to figure out the winner itself.

A new phase of drilling for shale gas, which the Government hopes will revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, was given the go-ahead yesterday. The controversial technique of extracting the gas from subterranean rock – known as fracking – was suspended last year after it was believed to have caused two small earthquakes in Lancashire. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said new conditions had now been imposed to minimise the risk of seismic activity. Scroll down for video. However, he did recognise the environmental concerns of those living near shale gas wells, which could soon spring up in many parts of the country. Fears have been expressed over possible water pollution and nuisance from lorries transporting equipment, but Mr Davey pledged to address them. ‘It is essential that shale gas development should not come at the expense of local communities,’ he said. ‘Fracking must be safe and the public must be confident that it is safe. ‘We are strengthening the stringent regime already in place with new controls around seismic risks. And as the industry develops we will remain vigilant to all emerging evidence to ensure the local environment is protected.’ Advocates of fracking – the process by which water and chemicals are pumped into shale deposits at high pressure to release trapped pockets of gas – say it will end our dependence on expensive imports and protect consumers from rising prices, as North Sea gas reserves dwindle. David Cameron this week backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale ‘gas revolution’, claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills. Lib Dem Mr Davey was more cautious yesterday, saying only that shale gas would hold down future gas price rises rather than slash them, as has happened in the US. Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on estimated gas reserves of up to 300trillion cubic feet, according to industry experts – enough to supply Britain for 120 years. But it is not yet clear how much of the trapped gas is recoverable, with drilling so far restricted to Lancashire, where energy firm Cuadrilla Resources has dug four exploratory wells. When it announced its finds last year, Cuadrilla said it would drill up to 800 wells over 16 years and, if production was successful, it could create thousands of jobs and generate £5billion-£6billion in tax revenues. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has granted 176 exploration licences across Britain, although holders still require further consent before fracking can commence. It is thought fracking will not begin again until late March at the earliest because Cuadrilla will need to secure fresh planning permission for its wells. There is growing local concern about fracking in Lancashire, as well as other areas thought to be rich in shale gas such as Sussex and South Wales. The Campaign to Protect Rural England yesterday warned of a greater backlash if large areas of countryside were ‘transformed into industrial sites’ with a steady stream of lorries transporting gas and polluted water away from drilling sites. Controversial: Drilling in the Blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the Government wants to expand the use of fracking in Britain. Paul Miner, the CPRE’s senior planning officer, said: ‘The Government doesn’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level.’ The rural splendour of George Osborne’s constituency in Cheshire could be blighted by his enthusiasm for shale gas exploration. Tatton. includes unspoilt countryside, the historic towns of Knutsford and. Wilmslow, and villages such as Alderley Edge – said to have more. millionaires per square mile than anywhere else in the country. Professor. Peter Styles of Keele University said the rocks in Tatton are of. interest to energy firms as they are from the same period as those in. Lancashire, where exploratory drilling suggests there could be enough. shale gas to power Britain for decades. He added shale gas exploration. requires ‘around a football pitch worth of land’ per site. A. report from the Royal Academy of Engineering also lists Cheshire as an. area of interest for ‘fracking’ – the technique used to extract the gas. But. exploration in the area could be opposed by residents, who have been. swift to protest against threats to the countryside in the past. Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs if a test-drill for gas was allowed in the area by the local authority. In the US, households near to wells have complained of increased traffic and polluted water supplies. But the Institute of Directors stressed that if the environmental fears could be allayed, shale gas offered great potential for the future. Its senior economic adviser Corin Taylor said the UK’s energy mix must include more gas, along with green energy and nuclear power, to meet carbon targets. And energy minister John Hayes added that the Government had taken ‘the very best’ scientific advice on fracking and said: ‘We have out every safeguard in place; this is the most rigorous regime in the world, I think.’ However, some in Mr Davey’s party remain unconvinced that shale gas will provide the predicted energy revolution. A senior Lib Dem source told the Daily Mail: ‘There is no principled objection to shale gas. But all these Tories calling for it could be in for a rude awakening. 'Shale gas wells will generate a lot of traffic and disruption. It could make objections to onshore wind look like a picnic.’ Environmentalists fear a ‘dash for gas’ could also prevent Britain meeting its climate change targets. But Mr Davey said these would be met, despite resumption of fracking. He said: ‘Shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the UK. It could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas.’ The new controls will include a ‘traffic light system’, requiring operators to stop if seismic activity reaches 0.5 on the Richter scale. An industry source said: ‘The new threshold is very conservative – it’s the equivalent of a large vehicle driving past on the road.’ Last year protestors attached themselves to the Cuadrilla shale gas exploration site near Hesketh Bank in Lancashire. So how serious are the environmental concerns? By David Derbyshire. Shale gas could become the greatest contribution to Britain’s energy supplies since the North Sea boom of the 1970s. But those against fracking say the environmental consequences outweigh the benefits. So what are those concerns and how serious are they? Earthquakes. Much has been made of the suspension of exploratory fracking at Blackpool last year after two small quakes of Richter scale magnitude 1.5 and 2.2 were recorded. The Cuadrilla drilling company said that its operations were probably responsible. But they were too minor to do any damage – and according to the British Geological Survey there were nine tremors in the UK of the same magnitude in the past two months alone. A follow-up study by the Department for Energy and Climate Change concluded that the risk of earthquakes caused by fracking was low, and structural damage to buildings, bridges and roads was extremely unlikely. POLLUTION. Millions of gallons of water and chemicals are forced into the ground during fracking operations, and there are concerns that some of the residue could leak into the water table. However, Parliament’s Energy Select Committee says there is little risk to water supplies in the UK, as long as the drilling is done correctly. Anger: Demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the Houses of Parliament. Leaks. in America have been caused by badly maintained wells which haven’t. been lined properly. British supporters of shale gas development say. rules are tougher here. US. companies are also allowed to store dirty water from fracking wells in. open tanks, whereas in Britain fracking companies will have to store the. water in sealed containers on site. Concerns. have also been expressed about chemicals leaking from gas wells into. underground water aquifers and reaching the domestic supply. However,. most fracking is done thousands of feet deep – far below the water. table. Energy Secretary Ed Davey made a statement to Parliament on the Government's new policy on shale gas. US. protesters have complained about methane getting into their drinking. water. Again, the industry says this was caused by bad fracking. If. wells are lined, there is no reason why methane should escape. THREAT TO THE LANDSCAPE. The Department of Energy and Climate Change says nearly two thirds of Britain lies over shale gas reserves. If the predicted boom materialises, gas wells could spring up across the countryside. While they are not as imposing as wind farms, pylons or power stations, this would represent some industrialisation of rural Britain. Cuadrilla concedes that drilling and fracking rigs would be visible from a distance, but would be on site for only a few months. After that, they say wells could be screened from view. NUISANCE. Fleets of lorries will be needed to bring in excavation, drilling and storage equipment to create the well, and to bring the sand and chemicals for the fracking process. In the short term, shale gas would also be taken away by lorries, though it is cheaper to pipe it out. Over time, however, gas companies will almost certainly create a network of new gas pipes. THE BENEFITS. In America, fracking has slashed domestic gas prices and there could be similar major effects on household energy bills in the UK. David Cameron believes shale gas will eventually bring down prices here. Energy Secretary Ed Davey is a little more cautious, however, saying only that it will hold price increases down – but even that would be a relief to the long-suffering consumer. What is beyond doubt is that shale gas would reduce our reliance on imports, particularly those from Russia.The UK could also reduce reliance on piped gas from overseas by investing in desperately needed storage. In environmental terms, shale gas is deemed to be cleaner than coal and oil, though slightly less clean than North Sea gas. VIDEO: Energy Secretary Ed Davey says shale gas could play key role... Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The UK government has given the go-ahead for a new phase of drilling for shale gas in the hopes it will revolutionize the country's energy supply. Fracking, a technique to extract gas from subterranean rock, was suspended after causing two small earthquakes in Lancashire. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has imposed new conditions to minimize the risk of seismic activity and address concerns over water pollution and transport issues. Shale gas reserves could supply Britain for 120 years, reducing the country's dependence on expensive imports and potentially protecting consumers from rising prices. Critics argue that the environmental consequences of fracking outweigh the benefits and Britain's reliance on gas may prevent the nation from meeting its climate change targets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: International law is a highly-competitive field. Attorneys who practice in this area often work for international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Bank. Alternately, international lawyers can work for large firms on cross-border deals involving corporations in different countries. These kind of jobs are difficult to get. Even if you graduate law school and pass the bar, you very well might not be able to get one of these jobs. Competition to get a job with an international non-governmental organization (NGO) will be fierce. There are very few international human rights jobs, period. In fact, breaking into this field is extremely challenging. Furthermore, most cross-border deals are done by large law firms, which are the most selective. You are expected to be near the top of your class and to have graduated from a selective law school in order to be hired at international law firms. Against your job prospects you also should weigh how you will finance your legal education. The cost of a legal education has exploded in the past decade. Students routinely pay over 30,000 a year in tuition alone, which does not include additional costs for living expenses. If you are not careful, you could graduate law school 200,000 in debt. CAS is used by all law schools. You send them your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluation; they create a packet and send it to the law school. The service requires a fee. Register early and make sure to get your transcripts to CAS in a timely manner. Now is the time to draw on the relationships you have built up with faculty during your undergraduate career. Ask your professors if they can write you a strong letter of recommendation. Only follow through if that professor says “yes.” If you didn't build strong relationships with faculty, don't despair. You can also ask for recommendations from present and past employers, as well as from people associated with church or volunteer organizations. Some recommenders may need to be prompted to complete the letter. Send a friendly email reminder, or stop in to chat. Law schools require that you write a short statement, typically on a topic of your choosing. The statement is usually only 500 words. Follow the directions. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. Also, if they give you a word limit, stick to the limit. Going over, by even a few words, can harm your chances of admission. Feel free to write about your interest in international law. You may want to write about your experience studying abroad. Whatever you write about, make sure that it is fresh, engaging, and memorable. You also should feel free to write about any subject that you want. You do not have to explain why you want to be a lawyer (unless the prompt specifies that you should write about that subject). An addendum can be a great way to explain something that looks bad in your application. A solid addendum will provide context for any information that might raise “red flags.” Red flags include criminal convictions, punishment for cheating or plagiarism, or semesters with very low grades. An addendum might also clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another. Remember to explain in your addendum, not make excuses. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a bigger story or information. In this article, it talks about how becoming an international lawyer is a tough job that needs a lot of hard work and good education. Also, it costs a lot of money to study law, and you need to have good relationships with your teachers and other people who can say good things about you. Then, when applying for law school, you need to write a short and interesting story about yourself to impress the school you want to join. Finally, if there are any problems or something bad in your past, you can write an addendum, which is another short note to explain those things and make sure they don't stop you from getting a good chance in law school."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: \\"Where was Athanasius when he was targeted for arrest?\\" Context: \\"Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work Four Orations against the Arians and defended his own recent conduct in the Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Athanasius was in Alexandria, Egypt, when he was targeted for arrest by Constantius, who was the Roman Emperor at that time and a supporter of Arianism. This incident took place in 356 AD, during a vigil service that Athanasius was attending. In order to escape arrest, Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he sought refuge in several monasteries and other safe houses during his time in exile. This attempt at arresting Athanasius was a result of Constantius renewing his policies in favor of Arianism, a theological school of thought that was considered heretical by the supporters of the orthodox Nicene Creed. Athanasius, a staunch defender of the Nicene Creed and a prominent figure in the fight against Arianism, became a prime target for Constantius and his Arian supporters. Consequently, Athanasius was banished from Alexandria multiple times due to the political and religious tensions that surrounded the issue of Arianism. Despite the difficulties and dangers he faced during this period of exile in Upper Egypt, Athanasius continued to be productive and engaged in intellectual and theological activities. He completed his work entitled Four Orations against the Arians, which was a comprehensive theological treatise against Arianism, and defended his own actions in two works: Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Furthermore, as mentioned in the context, the persistent opposition he faced from Constantius, as well as the information he received about the persecution of non-Arians by the Arian bishop George of Laodicea, led Athanasius to write the emotionally-charged History of the Arians. In this work, he portrayed Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist, reflecting the deep conflict and animosity that existed between the supporters of Arianism and those upholding the Nicene Creed. In summary, when Athanasius was targeted for arrest in 356 AD, he was in Alexandria, attending a vigil service. He managed to escape and subsequently went into hiding in Upper Egypt, where he continued his theological activities and wrote crucial works against Arianism, further solidifying his position as a key figure in the defense of orthodox Christianity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur. Now, I have a new situation: The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.

This looks like this: 4 * k - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 So, now we have: 4 * k = 4 Our last step is to find out the value of k. We have 4 times k equaling 4. To find out k, we need to divide both sides by 4.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

On the left side, the like terms are 31*r and -151*r, and on the right side, the like terms are 10 and -610. Combining the terms on the left side, we get: (31 - 151) * r = 10 - 610 This simplifies to: -120*r = -600 Now, to solve for r, we will isolate r by dividing both sides of the equation by -120: r = -600 / -120 Dividing -600 by -120 results in: r = 5 So, the solution for the equation 31*r - 151*r = 10 - 610 is r = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1854 he entered the Bengal medical service, and went to Calcutta. Subsequently he went to Delhi, where he was actively engaged during the mutiny, returning to Calcutta in 1858. His health failing, he came home, and, the steamer being detained at Aden for some days, he made an interesting collection of the plants of that region, upon which he based his ‘Florula Adenensis,’ published in 1860.

Translate to English English:","completion":"High Representative Ashton, we are looking forward to your actions in eliminating the current discrimination of new member states in the upcoming EUH. In more detail, the concern addressed to High Representative Catherine Ashton involves the anticipation and interest in her upcoming initiatives aimed at removing any ongoing discrimination faced by new European Union member states in the context of the European Union High. This topic is vital, as the fair treatment of all member states is crucial for maintaining unity, equal opportunities, and overall cohesion within the European Union. The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 27 European countries that aims to foster cooperation and integration among the member states. As the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and as Vice-President of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton has a significant role in shaping policies and initiatives that affect the EU and its member states, both internally and internationally. Therefore, it is crucial that she uses her position to address any possible discrimination against newly joined member states and ensure parity. One potential solution that High Representative Ashton could propose for addressing the issue of discrimination towards new member states would be the development and implementation of comprehensive anti-discrimination policies that cover all aspects of EU operations. These policies could be officially adopted by the European Union institutions, ensuring that the principles of fairness and non-discrimination are upheld across all facets of the EU's activities. In addition to adopting robust anti-discrimination policies, High Representative Ashton could also facilitate dialogues and discussions among all member states on how to augment collaboration and provide more significant support to new member states. These discussions could lead to new partnerships, shared resources, and joint initiatives that further promote cohesive integration and equal treatment among the member states. High Representative Ashton might also consider creating a dedicated platform or channel for addressing discrimination concerns within the EU directly. This platform will serve as a transparent and unbiased resource for gathering information, investigating concerns, and resolving any disputes related to discrimination in the European Union. Overall, High Representative Ashton's actions in addressing the current discrimination against new member states send a strong message stressing that the EU is committed to treating all its members, new or existing, with fairness and parity. Such initiatives will not only improve the EU's internal dynamics but will also contribute to its global image as a union that promotes and values equity and justice for all its partners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The easiest way to make exercise fun is by sticking with workout routines that you know you'll enjoy. Explanation: Option A is incorrect because it's poorly structured and slightly repetitive. Option C is wrong because it assumes that exercising in an indoor gym is the only way to have a better time, which is not applicable to everyone. Option D is irrelevant to the topic as it encourages people to assess their day rather than focusing on finding enjoyable exercises. Option B is the correct choice because it provides a helpful suggestion for people to make exercise enjoyable by finding activities they like."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Courtesy and respect: It is possible that the person who made the comment about the star did not have the same level of knowledge about the subject as you do. By refraining from making a sarcastic remark, you might have chosen to be courteous and respectful towards that person rather than displaying condescension or offending them. 3. Preserving relationships: In any social or professional setting, maintaining positive relationships is essential. By not making a snarky remark, you may have been trying to avoid causing tension or awkwardness that could have a negative impact on your relationship with that person and others present in the situation. 4. Self-awareness: You mention that you're proud of yourself for withholding your snark. This indicates a level of self-awareness and understanding of the potential implications of such comments. You might have held back your snark to demonstrate personal growth and restraint in a situation where making that remark could be seen as unnecessary or unfavorable.

In mitosis, the products are identical to the parent cell, while in meiosis the products are different from the parent cell. [c]. In mitosis, one cell divides into two cells, while in meiosis two cells combine to make one cell. [d]. Mitosis involves separating the chromosomes, while meiosis involves only the cytoplasm of the cell.","completion":"To answer this question, let's first define mitosis and meiosis: Mitosis is a type of cell division where a cell divides into two daughter cells, each having the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is involved in growth and repair of cells. Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each having half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is the process by which sexual reproduction occurs, producing gametes (sperm and egg cells) that have half the genetic information of the parent cells. Now let's analyze each given option: [a]. Incorrect. Mitosis occurs in all cells of animals and plants, while meiosis occurs in cells that produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) in sexually reproducing organisms, not just bacteria. [b]. This statement is correct. In mitosis, the products (daughter cells) are identical to the parent cell, having the same number of chromosomes and genetic information. In meiosis, the products (gametes) have half the number of chromosomes and genetic information of the parent cell, which results in diversity among offspring. [c]. Incorrect. In both mitosis and meiosis, one cell divides to form more cells, not combine. Mitosis produces two daughter cells, while meiosis produces four daughter cells (gametes). [d]. Incorrect. Mitosis also involves the separation of chromosomes, like meiosis. The primary difference between the two is the number of daughter cells produced and the amount of genetic material contained within each daughter cell. Thus, the correct answer is option [b]. In mitosis, the products are identical to the parent cell, while in meiosis the products are different from the parent cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: Son of Frankenstein Movie plot: Years after the events of the last film Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), son of Henry Frankenstein (creator of the Monster), relocates his wife Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and their young son Peter (Donnie Dunagan) to the family castle. Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son. The film ends with the village turning out to cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. We also see Krogh has a new false arm.

Movie title: American Beauty Movie plot: Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a 42-year-old father, husband and advertising executive who serves as the film's narrator. Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential, is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring, faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated, however, when he meets Jane's friend and classmate, the egotistical Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela, much to his daughter's embarrassment. Throughout the film, Lester has fantasies involving a sexually aggressive Angela and red rose petals. The Burnhams' new neighbors are Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper), his distracted wife Barbara (Allison Janney), and his camcorder-obsessed son Ricky (Wes Bentley). When confronted with the gay couple living two doors down, Col. Fitts displays a distinctly bigoted attitude.Over the course of a few days, each of the Burnhams individually makes a life-changing choice. Carolyn meets real estate rival Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) for a business lunch and ends up beginning an affair with him, and later takes up shooting lessons (a suggestion of Kane's). Lester blackmails his boss Brad Dupree (Barry Del Sherman) for 60,000, quits his job, and takes up low-pressure employment as a burger-flipper at a fast food chain. He continues to liberate himself by trading in his Toyota Camry for his dream car, a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, starts working out to impress Angela, and starts smoking a genetically enhanced form of marijuana. Jane, while growing distant from Angela, develops a romantic relationship with Ricky, having bonded over what he considers to be his most beautiful camcorder footage he has ever filmed, that of a plastic grocery bag dancing in the wind. Ricky himself quickly befriends Lester and secretly acts as... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie American Beauty, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) does not convince anyone to flee with him to New York City as this particular plot point is not present in the film. However, there is a development in the relationship between Ricky and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch). As they grow closer to each other, they bond over Ricky's artistic eye, mainly in his fascination with capturing seemingly ordinary life moments with his camcorder. These shared experiences eventually lead to a romantic relationship. To further explore the film's plot, it's important to look deeper into the overall theme of suburban life and the hypocrisy, repressed desires, and dissatisfaction it can entail for the characters. The Burnham family, as well as their neighbors, the Fitts, are shown to be dealing with their individual struggles. On the one hand, we have Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) seeking personal liberation and reinvigoration from his rather dull life. The trigger for Lester is meeting Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), a friend of his daughter Jane, and his infatuation with her leads to a series of changes he initiates in his life. In contrast to Lester, his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) engages in an affair with her real estate rival Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and starts taking shooting lessons, which she sees as a way to empower herself. Simultaneously, Jane, who is struggling with self-esteem issues, drifts away from her friend Angela and gets closer to Ricky Fitts. Ricky Fitts is presented as a camcorder-obsessed teenager whose strict military father, Col. Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), disapproves of his artistic inclinations and his strained relationship with his family, especially after violent confrontations. However, the film does not follow any storyline where Ricky convinces someone to flee with him to New York City. In summary, while Ricky and Jane develop a close bond and romantic relationship in the movie, there is no specific event or decision involving Ricky convincing someone to move with him to New York City. The film explores the underlying social issues and individual struggles faced by the main characters, as their lives intersect and they seek to find meaning and satisfaction in their suburban environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of 4 metres (13.1 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it is not vertical.[70] Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape.[71] Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 metres (160 ft) in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically. and the situation: The scientists examined both the Eastern and the Western slopes of the mountain.

Mr Swinney said a \\"fiscal framework\\" needed to link Scotland's budget to economic performance. But the prime minister has insisted \\"unprecedented devolution on taxes\\" was being sent to Holyrood. David Cameron made his comment during clashes with the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at PMQs in the House of Commons. In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government should be given \\"flexibility and choice to pursue its own distinct policies\\". Scotland's deputy first minister was speaking as he led a debate on Westminster's Scotland Bill. The bill is the legislation drawn up to deliver the recommendations of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the \\"No\\" vote in the independence referendum last September. The commission was intended to deliver the pledges made in the Vow, a last minute pledge by the three main Unionist parties exactly a year ago to give Scotland widespread new powers over tax and welfare. Mr Swinney told MSPs that the Smith Commission did not meet the promises of the Vow and the Scotland Bill did not at present fully implement the recommendations of the commission. He called for the UK government to \\"move significantly\\" when the Scotland Bill returns to Westminster for its Report Stage and outlined areas where the bill \\"fell short\\" such as social security, employment programmes and the Crown estate. The MSP also complained that the bill allowed UK ministers to veto proposed changes to Universal Credit and energy schemes. Mr Swinney said there must be a \\"fiscal framework\\" to ensure further devolution provides the right incentives, linking the Scottish government's budget to Scottish economic performance. He told the chamber: \\"We should retain the rewards of our success, as we will bear the risks. \\"When the Scottish economy outperforms that of the rest of the UK, our spending power should increase.\\" Mr Swinney added: \\"I want to make very clear again that the Scottish government will not recommend that this parliament gives consent to the bill without an agreed fiscal framework that is fair to Scotland. \\"I would have no hesitation to refuse to recommend a proposal that did not provide us with the ability to use our powers properly and flexibly to support the people of Scotland, to address our own priorities and to improve our economy.\\" Scottish Labour's democracy spokeswoman Claire Baker said her party wanted the devolution of the work programme, which seeks to get the long-term unemployed into work. She said the Scotland Bill needed to be stronger and did not meet her expectations. Ms Baker said her party would put forward amendments to the bill at Westminster and was committed to making sure the Scottish Parliament became one of the strongest devolved parliaments in the world. The debate followed clashes at prime minister's questions when Mr Robertson said the \\"Vow\\", made in the closing days of the independence referendum campaign last year, had not been delivered by the Tory government in Westminster. He added that even former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said delivery was \\"falling short\\". Mr Cameron said: \\"We have delivered on all of the promises that we made. He said: \\"We said we would introduce a Scotland Bill, we introduced a Scotland Bill. \\"We said unprecedented devolution on taxes, there has been unprecedented devolution on taxes. \\"We said that we would provide those welfare powers, we have given those welfare powers.\\" Mr Cameron said the SNP should stop talking about processes and \\"start telling us what taxes you are going to put up, what welfare changes you are going to make\\".","completion":"The finance secretary said that it would be wrong to make a deal that makes Scotland's budget smaller. He thinks that Scotland's budget should be linked to how well its economy is doing, but the prime minister says that they are giving Scotland more control over taxes. There is a disagreement about whether the new bill, which is about giving Scotland more power over taxes and other things, is fair to Scotland.

It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting.

Question: Who is thrown against the wall and knocked unconscious? Title: The Blob Movie plot: A meteorite crashes near the town of Arborville, California. An elderly transient (Frank Collison) discovers, within the sphere, a jelly-like substance (the Blob) that attaches itself to his hand. Three high school students, Brian (Kevin Dillon), the rebellious biker whose next false step will take him to major jail, as this day is precisely his 18th birthday, Meg (Shawnee Smith) the high school pretty girl, and Paul (Donovan Leitch) the successful football player, encounter the man and take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient's body melting (or disolving or being digested) from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being dissolved by the growing Blob and while trying to free him his arm is torn from his body, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious and the Blob oozes out of the hospital and oozes into a nearby manhole into a sewer.After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police who refuses to belive the teens that something is going on, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman is grabbed and pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer where it retreats because it cannot tolerate extreme cold. After eating the diner's owner and the town's sheriff, the Blob reenters the sewers.Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs (Paul McCrane) is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca), who orders the town quarantined. Brian escapes a military van and collects his motorbike.Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother Kevin (Michael Kenworthy) is missing.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Jan killed Alex's father because he had been having an affair for years. Given the context: How would Alex feel after? A:","completion":"After finding out that Jan had killed his father due to a long-standing affair, Alex would likely experience a complex and overwhelming mix of emotions that can be dissected into multiple elements. 1. Grief: The loss of a parent is always a significant and devastating moment for anyone. In this case, the fact that Alex's father was killed violently by someone else only intensifies the sense of loss and grief. Alex may experience feelings of sadness, anger, and confusion as he mourns his father's death. 2. Betrayal: Discovering that his father had been having an affair for years adds another layer of complexity to Alex's emotional response. He may feel betrayed by his father's infidelity as it shatters his perception of his father as a trustworthy and loyal husband and parent. This sense of betrayal may lead to disappointment, disillusionment, and resentment towards his father. 3. Anger: The fact that Jan went to the extent of killing in response to the affair might fill Alex with anger and fury, not only towards Jan for taking away his father's life but also towards his father for putting himself in that situation. This anger might be directed at both parties and could fuel Alex's drive to seek justice or retribution. 4. Sympathy: On the other hand, depending on the circumstances surrounding the affair and Jan's actions, Alex may feel sympathy or understanding for Jan's motivations. If Jan was significantly hurt by the affair, Alex might empathize with their pain while still condemning the act of murder. 5. Anxiety: The entire incident could leave Alex feeling anxious about the future. He may worry about who he can trust and may question his relationships with both his deceased father and Jan. Additionally, if Jan is not yet apprehended, Alex might be fearful for his safety or the safety of others in his family. 6. Guilt: Alex may also experience guilt, wondering if there was anything he could have done to prevent the situation or if he had inadvertently played a part in the tragic outcome. He may replay events in his mind, searching for missed signs, and agonizing over the thought that he could have taken action to prevent the murder. In conclusion, Alex's emotional response to these events would be multifaceted, encompassing grief, betrayal, anger, sympathy, anxiety, and guilt. The intensity and longevity of these emotions would be heavily influenced by Alex's pre-existing relationship with his father, Jan, and any other individuals involved, as well as his personal coping mechanisms and the support he receives from friends and family in processing this traumatic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. Paragraph: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village knew more about bee pollination?

Yes To understand why both sentences can be true, it's important to dissect the information provided in each sentence and examine how they relate to one another. Additionally, analyzing the key features of bond pricing and yields will provide a better understanding of the situations presented in the two statements. First sentence: \\"At the very long end, the 30-year bond US30YT = RR slid a full point for a yield of 4.47 percent from 4.41 percent.\\" This sentence presents the following information: 1. The bond's initial yield is 4.41%. 2. The bond's price drops by 1 full point. 3. As a result of this price change, the yield increases to 4.47%. A point to note here is that bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship. Therefore, when the price of a bond goes down, the yield goes up, and vice versa. Second sentence: \\"At the very long end, the 30-year bond US30YT = RR lost 2 / 32 for a yield of 4.41 percent.\\" This sentence contains the following information: 1. The bond's initial yield is not mentioned directly but can be inferred. 2. The bond's price drops by 2/32 of a point. 3. As a result of this price change, the yield increases (the exact initial yield is not given, but since the second sentence only states that the yield is 4.41% after the change, the initial yield should be lower). Considering the details in each sentence, one possible scenario is as follows: 1. The bond's initial yield is lower than 4.41%. 2. The bond's price drops by 2/32 of a point, resulting in a yield of 4.41% (as mentioned in the second sentence). 3. The bond's price then drops by an additional 1 full point, resulting in a yield of 4.47% (as mentioned in the first sentence). In this case, both sentences can be true, indicating that the bond experienced a drop in price on two separate instances, resulting in the yields mentioned in each sentence. Therefore, the answer is B). Yes, both sentences can be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Which entity is this text about? Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson (May 25, 1878 - November 25, 1949) was an American tap dancer and actor, the best known and most highly paid African-American entertainer in the first half of the twentieth century. His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: Robinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. \\"Can I call you Uncle Billy?\\" I asked. \\"Why sure you can\\", he replied... \\"But then I get to call you darlin.'\\" It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his \\"darlin.'\\" Temple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film. Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner. Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview \\"Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all.\\" Entity:","completion":"This text is about Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, an American tap dancer and actor who was the best known and most highly paid African-American entertainer in the first half of the twentieth century.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For anyone still doubting the belief that our emotions impact our physical health, a new study from New Zealand should be able to settle the matter. It reports that the physical wounds of healthy seniors healed more quickly if they wrote about their most upsetting experiences. This confirms the results of a 2010 study, and extends those findings to cover older adults-a group that is likely to suffer wounds (as from surgery), and one with less access to other ways of lowering tension (such as exercise). Reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a research team led by the University of Auckland's Elizabeth Broadbent made a study featuring 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 64 to 97. They were assigned to write for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive days. Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others. The others were asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions or beliefs. Two weeks after the third day of writing, all participants received a standard 4mm skin biopsy on their inner arm. The very tiny wounds caused by the biopsy were photographed regularly over the following days to determine the rate at which they healed. On the 11th day after the biopsy, the wounds completely healed on 76.2 percent of those who had done the expressive writing. That was true of only 42.1 percent of those who had written about everyday activities. \\"The biological and psychological mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear,\\" the researchers wrote, noting that those who had done the expressive writing did not report lower stress levels or fewer depressive symptoms than the others in the control group. Even if they weren't consciously aware of feeling more relaxed or positive, the expressive writing appeared to have caused some sort of bodily reaction-probably involving their immune systems-that hastened their recovery. Question: What was the difference between the two groups of participants in the study? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The difference between the two groups of participants in the study lies in the writing tasks they were assigned to perform for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive days. The first group, also known as the expressive writing group, was asked to write about the most upsetting experiences in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions, ideally not previously shared with others. The second group, or the control group, was asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions, or beliefs. The main purpose of the study was to examine the impact of these writing tasks on the healing rate of physical wounds, and the results showed that the expressive writing group experienced faster wound healing than the control group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here are possible answers to this question: - distract police from a r3al crime. - take life - misfire - arm robbers - break I believe the correct choice is \\"take life\\", here's why:","completion":"To answer the question \\"What could guns do which could be illegal?\\" let's analyze each potential answer and determine if they fulfill the criteria. 1. Distract police from a real crime: While this is a potential consequence of an illegally used gun, it is not the gun itself doing something illegal but rather how it is being used to divert attention. 2. Take life: Guns have the ability to take life when used improperly or with malicious intent, and taking someone's life without proper justification (such as self-defense) is an illegal act. This answer seems to fit the criteria. 3. Misfire: A gun misfiring is an unintended occurrence and, while it may lead to harm or injury, by itself it does not make the gun's action inherently illegal. It is more about the circumstances surrounding the misfire that determine the legality of the situation. 4. Arm robbers: This answer refers to providing guns for criminal purposes, such as arming robbers. In this case, the issue is not what the gun is doing, but rather the person who is providing the guns for illegal use. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of being an illegal action performed by the gun itself. 5. Break: This answer seems to refer to the act of a gun breaking or malfunctioning. Again, this is an undesirable occurrence, but it does not inherently make the gun's action illegal. It is more about how the malfunction is addressed or any negligence that might lead to harm or other illegal actions. After analyzing each answer, I agree that the correct choice is \\"take life\\", because it is the only one that describes a direct illegal action that a gun itself could perform, when used improperly or with malicious intent. The other answers are either a result of how the gun is being used or consequences of their use rather than the gun itself doing something illegal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Do the Right Thing Movie plot: Mookie (Spike Lee) is a 25-year-old black man living in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn with his sister, Jade (Joie Lee). He and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) have a son. He's a pizza delivery man at the local pizzeria, but lacks ambition. Sal (Danny Aiello), the pizzeria's Italian-American owner, has been in the neighborhood for twenty-five years. His older son Pino (John Turturro) intensely dislikes blacks, and does not get along with Mookie. Pino is at odds with his younger brother Vito (Richard Edson), who is friendly with Mookie.

Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that he doesn't need to feature anyone but Italians as it is his restaurant. Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him. During the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race, which leads to a series of scenes in which the characters spew racial insults into the camera. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his hatred, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal. That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march...

Fox cartoons refers to animated television series presented by the American TV network Fox Broadcasting Company. During the more than thirty-year existence of the Network, there have been many successful prime time animated series and Fox cartoons. The first and most famous of these, \\"The Simpsons\\", was the first such series since the end of \\"The Flintstones\\" in the 1960s. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Simpsons may be considered one of the first documentaries to appear since the flintstones ended in the 1960s Available options: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","completion":"c). No. The statement that \\"The Simpsons may be considered one of the first documentaries to appear since the Flintstones ended in the 1960s\\" is incorrect. This is because The Simpsons is not a documentary but rather an animated situational comedy show. The term \\"documentary\\" refers to a non-fictional film or television program that attempts to document some aspect of reality, often for the purpose of instructing, educating, or maintaining a historical record. The preceding text correctly identified that \\"The Simpsons\\" was the first prime time animated television series since \\"The Flintstones\\" in the 1960s. The text correctly describes both \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"The Flintstones\\" as animated television series, making no mention of the documentary genre. Therefore, the subsequent statement does not accurately follow from the previous text. The Simpsons marked a significant milestone in the history of television and the genre of animation due to its monumental success and longevity. It has been an influential force in popular culture since its debut in 1989, featuring a satirical take on the life of an American family. The show uses humor to comment on social, political, and economic issues, making it a significant part of the cultural zeitgeist. In summary, while \\"The Simpsons\\" is an important and groundbreaking television series, it cannot be considered a documentary as it does not meet the criteria of the genre. It is a prime time animated series that utilizes satire and comedy to entertain and engage audiences, making the statement \\"The Simpsons may be considered one of the first documentaries to appear since the Flintstones ended in the 1960s\\" incorrect given the context of the preceding text."},{"prompt":"Question: Where could you see someone pretending to be an action figure but not trying to sell action figures?

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which location most probably suffered land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, location B most probably suffered land loss or similar processes that led to permanent loss of biodiversity. While location A experienced a temporary loss of biodiversity, which indicates that the environmental degradation in that area might be reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience, location B's loss is permanent, suggesting that the habitat has undergone processes such as land loss or other effectively permanent environmental changes. Consequently, location B is the area that most likely suffered from land loss or similar processes that contributed to the permanent loss of biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

B). no.","completion":"B). No. The statement provided does not contain any information on the number of French troops that were killed or wounded. The figures shared in the statement correspond specifically to the number of German troops who were killed, wounded, or declared missing in action during the battle on August 18. Thus, one cannot extrapolate or infer details about French casualties from this statement. We would require additional information or statistics that directly speak to the number of French casualties in order to accurately answer this question. This may include the number of French soldiers who were killed, those who were wounded, or even those who went missing during the battle - none of which are provided here. In studying historical battles, it's key to differentiate the figures involved, as the matter is of significant importance. Each side involved in a combat typically has its own separate total of casualties. This includes those who were injured (wounded), those who were killed, and those who were unaccounted for (missing in action). To avoid any confusion or inaccuracies, these numbers are categorized under the respective countries involved. Therefore, to determine the number of French troops killed and wounded, we need explicit data or sources specifying these figures for the French troops. Without such specific information, we cannot ascertain or speculate on these numbers. Therefore, in conclusion, the answer to the question, \\"Does 'A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed, wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle.' contain the correct answer to 'What were the number of French killed and wounded?'\\", is definitively no, because there's a clear distinction between the German and French troops, and the provided statement does not give any information regarding French casualties."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

They both indicate a ship's travel itinerary for the month of September, but the destinations and timeline of visit are switched. In the first sentence, \\"The ship visited Okinawa during the second September week and spent the rest of the month in Guam in the Marianas,\\" the ship embarked on its journey at Okinawa during the second week of September. Following that, it spent the remaining part of September in Guam, which is part of the Marianas. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"The ship attended Guam during the second week of September and then spent the rest of the month in Okinawa in the Marianas,\\" suggests a different order of events. Here, the ship's first destination during the second week of September is Guam, after which it sailed to Okinawa in the Marianas, spending the rest of September there. Despite both sentences involving the same locations – Okinawa and Guam in the Marianas – and the events taking place within the same month, the timeline of the ship’s destinations is different in each sentence. In essence, the order of the ship's visit to the two locations differs between the two sentences.

Hopkins was born at 512 Tenth Street in Sioux City, Iowa, the fourth child of four sons and one daughter of David Aldona and Anna (nee Pickett) Hopkins. His father, born in Bangor, Maine, ran a harness shop (after an erratic career as a salesman, prospector, storekeeper and bowling-alley operator), but his real passion was bowling, and he eventually returned to it as a business. Anna Hopkins, born in Hamilton, Ontario, had moved at an early age to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she married David. She was deeply religious and active in the affairs of the Methodist church. In 1915, New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel appointed Hopkins executive secretary of the Bureau of Child Welfare which administered pensions to mothers with dependent children. Hopkins at first opposed America's entrance into World War I, but, when war was declared in 1917, he supported it enthusiastically. He was rejected for the draft because of a bad eye. Hopkins moved to New Orleans where he worked for the American Red Cross as director of Civilian Relief, Gulf Division. Eventually, the Gulf Division of the Red Cross merged with the Southwestern Division and Hopkins, headquartered now in Atlanta, was appointed general manager in 1921. Hopkins helped draft a charter for the American Association of Social Workers (AASW) and was elected its president in 1923. In 1922, Hopkins returned to New York City, where the AICP was involved with the Milbank Memorial Fund and the State Charities Aid Association in running three health demonstrations in New York State. Hopkins became manager of the Bellevue-Yorkville health project and assistant director of the AICP. In mid-1924 he became executive director of the New York Tuberculosis Association. During his tenure, the agency grew enormously and absorbed the New York Heart Association. In 1931, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt named R. H. Macy's department store president Jesse Straus as president of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA). Straus named Hopkins, then unknown to Roosevelt, as TERA's executive director. His efficient administration of the initial 20 million outlay to the agency gained Roosevelt's attention, and in 1932, he promoted Hopkins to the presidency of the agency.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Start by moistening the seed-starting medium thoroughly, so that it provides a good growing environment for the seeds. Fill the containers with the medium, leaving about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between the top of the growing medium and the rim of the containers. Place the containers in a sunny, well-ventilated area with a steady, warm temperature. The way you sow your seeds is depending on what type of plant you're growing, so it's necessary to read the seed packet carefully first. Many seeds can be scattered evenly across the surface of the growing medium. Be sure not to place too many seeds in the same growing container, since you don't want them to crowd each other too much. Most seeds should be planted twice as deep as they are wide. Some seeds should be planted about 1⁄2 to 1⁄4 inch (1.3 to 0.6 cm) below the surface of the growing medium. Check your seed pack to make sure you sow the seeds correctly. Some seeds do best when they are chilled or soaked before sowing. Be sure you're providing the right sunlight conditions for your specific seed species. Most seeds can germinate without light, but they'll need sun as soon as they sprout. Most seeds do best with a temperature of about 78 degrees, but some need colder or warmer conditions to germinate. Seed growing medium tends to dry out quickly, since there's no soil to hold the water. Be sure to water the seeds consistently, never allowing them to dry out too much. You can lightly drape a piece of plastic wrap over the seed trays to help trap in moisture. Don't overwater the containers, or the seeds could become waterlogged. They should be moist, but not dripping wet. As the seeds sprout into seedlings, you'll see thin green stems emerge from the growing medium. If the containers aren't already placed in a sunny area, be sure to move them to a place with direct sunlight or provide them with grow lights overhead. Keep them moist at all times and make sure the temperature never drops below the recommended level. You can place a heat mat under the seed starting tray to maintain the correct temperature. After a week or two, weed out the weaker-looking seedlings so that the stronger ones have more room to grow. Leave about 2 - 3 seedlings per container.

Kuck said the extension was granted Tuesday, and it allows OPTIONS: - Atlanta to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - CNN to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Colotl to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Danielle Bennett to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Immigration and Customs Enforcement to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Jessica Colotl to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Kennesaw State University to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - Mexico to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - U.S. to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. - United States to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension.","completion":"The correct option in this case would be \\"Colotl to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension.\\" This conclusion is made based on the information provided in the text. In the context given, Jessica Colotl is the individual who has been granted the deferral of removal by U.S. immigration officials - Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She's therefore the principal concerned when it comes to the extension and anything related to it. It wouldn't make sense for any of the other entities mentioned - Atlanta, CNN, Danielle Bennett (the spokeswoman for ICE), Kennesaw State University (where Jessica is studying), Mexico, U.S, or United States - to apply for a work permit on behalf of Jessica Colotl since it is a personal matter closely tied to her immigration status. Moreover, applying for a work permit is usually a process handled by the individual seeking employment, not by an organization or a country, so Jessica Colotl is the most logical and likely subject in this case. This extension given by U.S. immigration officials essentially implies a temporary stay from deportation, the duration of which Jessica could take advantage by getting a work permit, to possibly support herself and her education."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career. The Osmond Brothers began as a barbershop quartet consisting of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay Osmond. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny and Jimmy, both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists as well. With the addition of Donny, the group became known as The Osmonds, and enjoyed its greatest success as both a boy band and a hard rock ensemble. By 1976, though, the group's record sales were softening; Osmondmania had long faded and been replaced by \\"Rollermania\\", as the Bay City Rollers became the hot pop band of choice in the mid-1970s. Their 1975 album The Proud One sold poorly (despite the title track providing a chart-topping easy listening hit and the group's last U.S. top-40 hit to date), and MGM Records was sold to Polydor Records. Their first album under Polydor was the album Brainstorm; that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor, and its lead single, \\"I Can't Live a Dream,\\" fell short of the top 40. Polydor would release two more albums from the family (a Christmas album that included all of the performing family members, and a greatest hits compilation). The Osmonds poured themselves into a new venture: the older brothers began producing The Donny & Marie Show which was a hit on ABC from 1976-1979. But the success came at a cost. The family built and operated at great expense a first-class television studio in Orem, Utah, where the show was produced beginning in 1977. As a result, the Osmonds as a performing band became a lower priority to Donny and Marie. The older brothers deferred or gave up their dreams of being a rock-and-roll band. Donny experienced stage anxiety and Marie had a brief bout with an eating disorder after a network executive told her she looked heavy. When the show was cancelled in 1979, the Osmonds were taken by surprise, as they had believed that the show would be renewed, and found themselves in debt and without a clear direction. The group left Polydor and attempted another album for Mercury Records, Steppin' Out, which was a major failure with neither the album nor any of its singles charting anywhere; it would be their only album on that label. Steppin' Out was a transitional album for the Osmonds and was produced under the auspices of Maurice Gibb; among its tracks was the first recorded version of \\"Rest Your Love on Me,\\" a country song that would become a hit for Gibb's own band, the Bee Gees, and topped the country charts in a cover version by Conway Twitty. They produced two unsuccessful projects for Marie, a sitcom pilot that never aired and a variety show revival that lasted seven episodes in 1980 and 1981. They recovered and eventually paid their debts and re-established their careers. Rather than go into bankruptcy, they resolved to honor all of their financial obligations.

Here are possible answers to this question: - grocery store - country - organization - army - pack I believe the correct choice is \\"army\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"While all of the options provided require some level of leadership, it is true that the army requires an exceptionally strong leader. Army leadership demands not only commanding troops but also making difficult decisions that can affect not just the lives of soldiers but also the outcome of wars and the course of history. Here's why: 1. High-stakes decision making: An army leader is responsible for making crucial decisions that have a direct impact on the lives of the soldiers under their command, as well as the outcome of battles and wars. They must make decisions that balance military objectives with the well-being of their soldiers and the interests of their country. This requires a strong leader with critical thinking skills, strategic vision, and the ability to make tough choices under pressure. 2. Maintaining morale: A strong army leader is instrumental in sustaining the morale of their troops, especially during times of hardship, loss, and uncertainty. They must have the ability to inspire and motivate people to remain committed to the cause, even in the face of adversity. This requires exceptional communication skills, emotional intelligence, and a deep understanding of human psychology. 3. Adaptability: In the constantly evolving nature of warfare, an army leader must be capable of adapting to new situations and adjusting strategies accordingly. This requires a strong grasp of military history, an in-depth understanding of tactics and strategy, and the ability to think creatively and resourcefully in response to new threats and challenges. 4. Discipline: A key component of a strong army leader is the ability to uphold and enforce discipline within the ranks. Discipline is vital in maintaining order, ensuring the effectiveness of the troops, and implementing successful strategies. A strong leader must have the determination and authority to demand and command respect from their soldiers, fostering a culture of accountability and dedication to the mission. 5. Building trust: A strong army leader must be able to build and maintain trust amongst their soldiers, their peers, and their superiors. This involves demonstrating competence, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of the troops, as well as the ability to listen, empathize, and communicate effectively with all members of the military organization. 6. Developing future leaders: In addition to leading their current troops, strong army leaders must also develop the soldiers in their ranks to become effective leaders of the future. This includes identifying potential leaders, providing opportunities for growth and development, and mentoring individuals to prepare them for increased responsibilities and roles within the military. In conclusion, the army indeed requires a very strong leader for its effective functioning and success. While grocery stores, countries, organizations, and packs also require leaders, the demands and consequences associated with army leadership necessitate a level of strength and commitment that exceeds that of other forms of leadership. An army leader must possess a unique set of skills, knowledge, and personal qualities that enable them to make difficult decisions, inspire their troops, and navigate the complex and high-stakes world of military operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act. Dumbo just feels even worse, but Timothy manages to take him to see his Mother, which cheers him up a little.

Write a text based on \\"weak dollar export supply boost s. african rand\\" Text:","completion":"Title: \\"How A Weak Dollar Paves the Way for a Robust South African Rand Amidst Export Supply Boom\\" Introduction: The weakening of the U.S. dollar in international markets has facilitated a significant upsurge in the value of the South African Rand, a currency that enjoys an inverse relationship with the greenback. The depreciating dollar has not only made it less expensive to import goods and services into South Africa, but it has also contributed to a substantial increase in the country's export supply. Consequently, South Africa's foreign exchange earnings have exhibited considerable growth, bolstering the country's economy and augmenting the resilience of the Rand. This article delves into the intricacies of this monetary phenomenon and its implications for the South African economy and the global market. The Weak Dollar and the South African Rand Connection: A frail U.S. dollar receives less attention than the stock market's performance or shifts in GDP. However, its influence should not be overlooked as it plays a critical role in determining the course of the global economy. When the dollar weakens, commodities, usually priced in dollars, become more affordable for South Africa, both to purchase for its domestic needs and to export in lieu of higher profit margins. Historical trends indicate that the South African Rand has an uncanny affinity for appreciating in the face of a depreciating U.S. dollar. This occurrence is mainly due to the weakening dollar making the Rand more attractive to foreign investors seeking profitable exchange rate differentials. As these investors buy the Rand to finance local investments, the demand for the currency goes up, raising its value. Export Supply Boost: South Africa has a resource-rich economy that heavily relies on commodity exports, such as gold, coal, platinum, and agricultural products. The weak dollar contributes to a surge in export demand as international buyers find products priced in Rands more affordable, increasing the competitiveness of South African goods vis-à-vis their global counterparts. Higher export earnings, in turn, increase the overall foreign exchange revenue, allowing the country to pay for imports, reduce its trade deficit and, in some cases, expand its stock of foreign reserves. Simultaneously, the robust export numbers have a trickle-down effect on various sectors of the South African economy. Local industries experience surges in production and export volumes, thereby boosting investor confidence, generating employment opportunities, and leading to overall economic growth. Inflation and Interest Rate Considerations: While the weak dollar and export supply boom seem to have positive short-term implications for the South African Rand, there are also potential long-term consequences to consider. At first glance, lower import prices caused by a weak dollar seem desirable for South Africa. However, they could lead to a deflationary spiral that poses significant economic risks. In addition, the South African economy faces constant inflationary pressures partly due to rapid currency appreciation. To curb inflation, the South African Reserve Bank may opt to adjust interest rates, which in turn affects foreign investment if the rates differ significantly from those set by other countries' central banks. As a result, tight monetary policy may dissuade foreign investors from the Rand, eventually hampering the currency's performance. Conclusion: The weak U.S. dollar has proven to be a catalyst for the recent growth of the South African Rand and bolstered the nation's export supply. This relationship has implications for the country's economy, global currency markets, and international investors. However, South Africa's policymakers must be vigilant in monitoring the effects of a weak dollar and potential inflationary pressures and implement comprehensive strategies to maintain stable growth and a resilient Rand for the long term."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee -- about 56 cups of espressos per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours. Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much.

Q: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road. Mail truck. Must be time for breakfast. About time I ate something. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why was Justin's face like leather? A:","completion":"Justin's face was like leather likely due to prolonged exposure to the sun and outdoor elements, as he spent a considerable amount of time working on tasks such as building his cattle pen. The sun and weather can cause skin to become tough and weathered over time, creating a leather-like appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, but it is related and can be inferred to some extent based on the information provided. The first sentence is a longer, casual statement that describes various activities with a focus on outdoor exploration. It mentions running after someone or something, going biking with someone, and exploring the neighborhood through a hike. The mention of earthworms comes at the end of the sentence, when the speaker asserts how surprising it is to find many earthworms during their exploration. The second sentence is a simple, declarative statement that asserts the presence of numerous earthworms in the ground. There is a connection between the two sentences, as both discuss the abundance of earthworms. However, the first sentence only implies that it is possible to find many earthworms during a neighborhood exploration but does not directly state that there are many earthworms in the ground as a general fact. The second sentence presents a general fact about the presence of earthworms in the ground, which may be taken as supporting information for the first sentence but is not directly entailed by it. To conclude, while the two sentences have a common theme and are related, the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. Rather, the second sentence provides a general fact about the prevalence of earthworms in the ground, while the first sentence uses the idea of finding many earthworms as a surprising observation during a local exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seventeen of his 28 books appeared on the New York Times best-sellers list, according to his website. Many of them reached the No. 1 spot. His writings also provided the inspiration for the \\"Rainbow Six,\\" \\"Ghost Recon\\" and \\"Splinter Cell,\\" video game series. Share your memories. His writing gained him a loyal following within the armed forces in the United States and abroad, giving him inside access that frequently informed the plots of his books.

You just can't do that,\\" he said in a 2003 CNN interview. \\"There was one thing, I discussed with a friend of mine in the Royal Navy.

While facing disasters at the Eastern front, Mehmed III died on 20 December 1603 at the age of 37. The new sultan Ahmed I who was 13 years old appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the commander of the eastern army who marched from Istanbul 15 June 1604, a very late time for the campaigning season. Until he reached the front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had already captured Yerevan in June and advanced towards Kars before being stopped in Akhaltsikhe. Seeing the late season as an excuse, he did not counter-attack Abbas I and decided to stay in Van until the end of the winter. However, the Safavid advance forced him to march towards Erzurum. The inactivity created unrest among the Turkish ranks. His campaign of 1605 was unsuccessful, the forces he led towards Tabriz suffering defeat near the shore of Lake Urmia on 9 September 1605. This was the first Safavid pitched victory against the Ottomans in their history. In this battle Abbas I utilized his predominantly cavalry force to great advantage, decisively defeating the Ottomans, who suffered some 20,000 dead. Kose Sefer Pasha, Beylerbey of Erzurum, acted independently and was captured by Safavid forces. Cağaloğlu had to withdraw to the fortress of Van and thence in the direction of Diyarbakır. He ordered the execution of Canbulatoğlu Hüseyin Pasha claiming he was late to reinforce the Ottoman army which caused a larger unrest. Sinan died in the course of this retreat in December 1605 and Abbas I was able to liberate Ganja, Baku, Shirvan and Shamakhi in Azerbaijan in June 1606.

Here is a detailed description of the data provided: Title: A Severed Wasp \\"A Severed Wasp\\" is a novel written by the esteemed author Madeleine L'Engle, who is best known for her classic science fiction/fantasy book \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\" Published in 1982, \\"A Severed Wasp\\" is a thought-provoking work of literary fiction that spans several decades, focusing on the life of its central character, Katherine Forrester Vigneras. The title itself is derived from a quote by the famous English poet George Herbert: \\"A severed wasp still stings.\\" L'Engle's novel is essentially a sequel to her earlier novel \\"The Small Rain,\\" which was published in 1945. However, \\"A Severed Wasp\\" can be read as a standalone novel, as it only refers to the events of the earlier book without relying on them for plot development. Language: English The language used in \\"A Severed Wasp\\" is English, which is the official language for several countries, including the United States, and carries both cultural and historical significance. English is a Germanic language that originated in England and has gradually evolved to become a global lingua franca for communication. It is used extensively in various fields such as literature, science, and business transactions, making the language an essential part of world communication and an influential component of culture. In \\"A Severed Wasp,\\" L'Engle employs the English language to weave an intricate tale of relationships, personal growth, and the power of art and music. The novel's protagonists and supporting characters come from diverse backgrounds and circumstances, yet they are connected by their use of the English language, highlighting the universality of the language and its ability to bridge gaps between people. Country: United States \\"A Severed Wasp\\" is associated with the United States, as both its author, Madeleine L'Engle, and its setting are rooted in this country. L'Engle was born in New York City and spent most of her life in the United States. The novel is set primarily in the city of New York, which serves as a backdrop for Katherine Forrester Vigneras's journey. The story reflects American society, culture, and history during the time periods in which the events take place. Through the setting and characters, \\"A Severed Wasp\\" not only presents a vivid picture of the United States but also addresses themes relevant to American society. It delves into issues such as social class, cultural differences, and personal identity while exploring the nature of human relationships and the role of art, including music, in people's lives. In conclusion, the data presented concerns a literary work named \\"A Severed Wasp\\" written in the English language by renowned author Madeleine L'Engle and set in the United States. The novel, which is a sequel to \\"The Small Rain,\\" explores themes such as personal growth, relationships, and the impact of art and music, while presenting a portrait of American society through the lives of its characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"Man in cap stands next to horse.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A man prepares to eat dinner.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise provided, \\"Man in cap stands next to horse,\\" does not offer enough information to confirm or refute the hypothesis, \\"A man prepares to eat dinner.\\" Both statements convey distinct scenarios, and there is no clear connection between the two. The premise describes a scene involving a man wearing a cap who is standing next to a horse. This suggests that the man could possibly be engaged in various activities related to horses, such as horseback riding, taking care of the horse, working on a farm, or participating in a sport like polo or horse racing. Alternatively, it could also portray a casual, candid moment where a man is standing next to a horse without any implied purpose. Based on this premise, it is difficult to draw any conclusion regarding the man's subsequent plans, including his intention to eat dinner. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that a man is preparing to eat dinner. It is an entirely distinct statement that does not reference the man's attire or his interactions with a horse or any other animals. The hypothesis focuses on a completely different aspect of the man's life – his meal – and does not provide any information about the context or the activities he might have been involved in before or after the mealtime scenario. In conclusion, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true as they convey different scenarios with no evident link or shared context. To establish the truth or falsity of the hypothesis, additional information would be required that specifically addresses the man's plans in relation to his dinner preparations. Without such details, it remains impossible to ascertain the validity of the hypothesis based solely on the provided premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Different materials will require different water temperatures in order to be effective. For fabric and upholstery, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dishwasher detergent with 2 cups (470 mL) of cool water. For carpet, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dishwasher detergent with 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water. Warm water is typically preferred over cold water to treat or clean carpets as it is more effective in lifting dirt and liquid residues from the carpet fibers. Most professional carpet cleaners only use warm water to clean carpets. Work from the outside of the stain towards the center. You will have a better chance of reversing the less saturated areas away from the central point, so focus on the edges first. If you do not have a white cloth, use a colored cloth or cotton balls instead. Since you are lifting the bleach stain, it may stain whatever cloth you choose to use. You want to give the dishwasher detergent solution a chance to lift up the bleach stain. Just make sure the area is saturated with the solution before letting it soak. This will help remove any of the bleach residue that was lifted by the diluted dishwasher detergent. Continue to blot the area until it is dry, or until no more of the bleach is lifting from the treated area. Blot at the stain with more solution and rinse it with more clean water until the stain is less noticeable, or until you are satisfied with the results. The treated area of the carpet might be stiff or a bit matted once you are done cleaning it. Leave the carpet to dry overnight, and then run a vacuum over the carpet in the morning.

For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues. Question: Which of the following statements about the blues is NOTtrue? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Thanks to rock, the blues became the mainstream of music.\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the statement \\"Thanks to rock, the blues became the mainstream of music.\\" is not the correct answer. The blues had a significant influence on many popular music genres such as jazz, country, and rock and roll, and helped shape music worldwide. However, it was not due to rock alone that the blues became mainstream in music. The blues' mainstream status was also achieved through its impact on various other genres and the popularity gained through famous musicians like W.C. Handy, Mamie Smith, and later artists like Robert Cray and Stevie Ray Vaughan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run. Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal. On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal. The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out. After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards. In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game. With the win, Buffalo snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 6-6.

Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue.

Q:This article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What place did Daniel Defoe visited in 1724? is inside the article: Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ...

Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland.

Answer:","completion":"Daniel Defoe visited the area known as Chat Moss in 1724. Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog that presented significant challenges for travel due to its inability to support the weight of horse or man, except in very dry seasons.

It was a very small event , I even baked the cake . Thing is , the next day he barely spoke to me . He was even rude at one point . Question How might this person feel after their boss 's attitude ? Answer:","completion":"This person might feel a mixture of emotions, including confusion, disappointment, hurt, and anger after their boss's attitude. Confusion: It is understandable that the person may feel puzzled about their boss's behavior, given that they went out of their way to organize a party and bake a cake in celebration of their boss's successful ten-year business anniversary. They may be unsure as to why their boss reacted in such an unexpected manner, especially after their genuine effort to make the event special. The lack of any overt signs of gratitude or appreciation from the boss may be further leaving the person bewildered. Disappointment: Given the effort and thought that went into planning the event, the person may feel disappointed with their boss's reaction. They may have hoped to receive some form of acknowledgment or positive feedback from their boss, but instead, they experienced a dismissive and even rude response. The person may be disheartened, as their expectation of a positive outcome was not met. Hurt: The person might feel hurt by their boss's behavior, as they likely did not anticipate any negativity associated with their kind gesture. They may feel that their boss's rude attitude implies that their hard work and genuine intentions went unnoticed or unappreciated. This can ultimately make the person feel unimportant or undervalued within their workplace. Anger: It is natural for the person to feel angry as a result of their boss's ungrateful attitude and negative response. They may feel that they have been wronged or treated unfairly, given the extent of their efforts to celebrate their boss's achievements. The person may also be upset that their boss was unreasonably rude to them, without any apparent reason for such behavior. It is important to consider that their boss's attitude could be a result of several factors unrelated to the party, such as stress, unrelated work issues, or personal matters. However, it is crucial for this person to find healthy ways to cope with their emotions and possibly address the situation with open communication. By discussing their feelings with their boss, they may be able to gain a better understanding of the underlying reason behind the unexpected behavior and find a resolution that benefits both parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It is now a year since the tax disc was scrapped - but motorists are still struggling to adjust to the new electronic system, figures suggest. The number of vehicles being clamped or impounded jumped from about 5,500 a month under the old system to more than 8,000 a month. And in July it hit a peak of 10,554. The rise has been put down to confusion over new rules that came in at the same time that tax discs were scrapped after 93 years. The DVLA is urging motorists to check the tax status of their vehicles on their website. This is accessible on mobile devices and works by entering the vehicle's make and registration number. Most people know that they no longer have to display a tax disc in their car window, an AA spokesman said. But many do not realise that when they sell a car or transfer its ownership the new owner has to tax the car even if the previous owner had several months of outstanding tax. It has put an end to the longstanding practice of advertising second hand cars that are taxed up to a certain date - but is also causing confusion among those who did not opt to set up a direct debit when the new system came in, added an AA spokesman, despite DVLA reminder letters. \\"The disc was an obvious reminder. It has now gone and we think people might be forgetting,\\" he added. Motoring organisations say the introduction of the new system was botched and have called for a publicity campaign to inform motorists of the changes. The DVLA says it sends reminder letters to all new vehicle keepers - but some motorists claim they were not notified. Dylan Casella, a student at Portsmouth University, had his car towed away and was hit with a Â£242 fine when his father transferred the ownership of a car into his name so he could get a parking permit. He told the BBC's You and Yours programme: \\"Once I received the car I didn't receive anything from the DVLA to say 'your car is not taxed and you need to renew it'. So as far as I was concerned I thought the tax had carried on and that was that. \\"I had actually gone on holiday to Budapest and returned to find my car had disappeared off the road. I headed home and checked in the post and found a letter from the DVLA to say my car had been towed, and taken up to Reading. And they said I had to come and collect it and pay Â£242. \\"I was very surprised because as far as I knew I thought the car was taxed.\\" A DVLA spokeswoman said the \\"vast majority of people tax their cars on time\\", with over 47 million drivers taxing their vehicles since 1 October 2014. Of these, nearly 34 million have chosen to tax their vehicles online or by phone.\\" Clamping \\"remains an effective enforcement tool,\\" she added, but it was \\"very much a last resort - vehicle keepers will typically receive a number of reminder letters advising them that they need to tax their vehicle before we take any enforcement action\\". Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act in September revealed the number of vehicles clamped or impounded went up from 5,806 in October 2014, when tax discs were scrapped, to more than 8,000 every month from January to August. The DVLA has denied claims by the AA that it is making more than Â£38m out of the new system, saying it has handed out more than double that amount in automatic tax refunds to motorists. The organisation is carrying out research into how many untaxed vehicles are currently on Britain's roads and will publish figures by the end of the year.

Answer:","completion":"On May 27, 1949, Robert Ripley, a famous American cartoonist, entrepreneur, and amateur anthropologist died. He gained immense popularity and fame through his creation of the newspaper series titled \\"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\\" Ripley's Believe It or Not! started as a newspaper panel series, featuring unusual and astounding facts, stories, and trivia from around the world. The idea for the series was first conceived by Robert Ripley in 1918 when he began drawing sports-related cartoons for the New York Globe. Gradually, Ripley's focus shifted from mere sports achievements to unusual and bizarre occurrences in various fields, including culture, history, and science. The first sketch containing the phrase \\"Believe It or Not!\\" appeared on December 19, 1918, with the publication of a piece describing an odd sports record. However, the series in its more recognizable form began on October 16, 1919, as a regular feature in the New York Globe, under the title \\"Champs and Chumps.\\" It showcased extraordinary feats and facts from all walks of life. Ripley's fascination with the strange and unbelievable continued to grow, and soon he started traveling the world to find the unique stories and oddities he presented in his works. By 1929, the \\"Believe It or Not!\\" panel series had been syndicated and was appearing in newspapers across the United States, as well as several international publications. Ripley's franchise expanded rapidly into various formats throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In addition to the newspaper series, there were books, radio shows, and in 1949, a short-lived television show. Ripley's unique collection of curiosities and bizarre items from his travels were displayed in his first \\"Odditorium\\" at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, which attracted massive interest. Today, this tradition continues in the form of Ripley's Believe It or Not! museums (odditoriums) in multiple locations worldwide. Robert Ripley's passion for discovering and sharing the peculiar and incredible aspects of human existence with his audience captured the public's imagination and brought to their attention the wonders and mysteries of the world. Even after his death, the legacy of Ripley's Believe It or Not! lives on through various forms of media, exhibitions, and a dedicated fan base, standing as a testament to his enduring impact and influence on the world of entertainment and popular culture."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people live longer happens, how will it affect more waste from living things.

Question: Where was Margaret sent after her arrest? Movie plot title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings.

Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter, pictured, was in a gang of sex attackers Leonard Rossiter died in his dressing room at the Lyric Theatre in London where he was starring in Joe Orton’s black comedy Loot. The squash-playing, keep-fit enthusiast had a heart attack that was sudden and unexpected. A unique aspect of the tributes to the much-loved actor and TV sitcom star was the paucity of wicked anecdotes about him. There were none of those villainous tales that are normally whispered back-stage about major stars. As his biographer Guy Adams observes, Rossiter approached acting ‘as a job, as solid and practical as book-keeping or car mechanics’. They were making the ground-breaking sci-fi story","completion":"Step 1: Gather and Analyze Information In order to investigate the claims, I would first collect all relevant information on the case, including the allegations made against Leonard Rossiter, any potential victims and witnesses, and gather his history and background information. Step 2: Identify Potential Evidence Next, I will look for any potential evidence or supporting materials that could substantiate or refute the claims. This could include interviews with those who knew Rossiter, any documented incidents involving Rossiter, and any other materials like diary entries, correspondences, or photographs. Step 3: Interview Witnesses In this step, I would carefully and professionally interview any potential witnesses or people who may know about the alleged incidents. This would help identify if there were others involved in the gang of sex attackers, as well as verifying or refuting the allegations against Rossiter. Step 4: Analyze the Accusations At this point, I would analyze the accusations and all the gathered evidence. This includes examining any patterns in the alleged incidents, credibility of witnesses, and identifying any potential biases or motives behind the allegations. Step 5: Collaborate with Other Professionals I would consult with other professionals and experts, such as forensic specialists or psychologists, to gain additional insights if necessary. They may have further expertise in areas that can support a deeper understanding of the evidence and allegations. Step 6: Establish a Timeline Creating a timeline of all the alleged incidents is essential. This will enable me to better understand the sequence of events, identify any inconsistencies or contradictions in accounts, and establish key dates during which Rossiter and the alleged victims may have interacted. Step 7: Evaluate the Case After analyzing all the collected information, I would evaluate the case to determine its credibility. This may include considering alternative explanations for the allegations and weighing the evidence for and against Rossiter's involvement. Step 8: Present Findings After the evaluation is complete, I will present the findings to the appropriate authorities, such as the police department, or to other relevant parties involved in the case. This would comprise a comprehensive report accompanied by a clear assessment of the strength of evidence against Rossiter and any potential accomplices. Step 9: Follow Up on New Information If any new information arises during or after the investigation, I would diligently follow up on it and incorporate it into my findings accordingly. This process is vital to ensure a thorough and accurate investigation of the claims against Leonard Rossiter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt) is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. The ICC has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The ICC is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore only exercise its jurisdiction when certain conditions are met, such as when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals or when the United Nations Security Council or individual states refer situations to the Court. The ICC began functioning on 1 July 2002, the date that the Rome Statute entered into force. The Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty which serves as the ICC's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute, for example by ratifying it, become member states of the ICC. Currently, there are 124 states which are party to the Rome Statute and therefore members of the ICC. However, Burundi has given formal notice that it will withdraw from the Rome Statute. The ICC has four principal organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry. The President is the most senior judge chosen by his or her peers in the Judicial Division, which hears cases before the Court. The Office of the Prosecutor is headed by the Prosecutor who investigates crimes and initiates proceedings before the Judicial Division. The Registry is headed by the Registrar and is charged with managing all the administrative functions of the ICC, including the headquarters, detention unit, and public defense office. 1.

OPTIONS: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","completion":"(1). yes. Given the premise, \\"Her integrity has simply prevented her from corrupting the process,\\" it can be understood that her integrity is the driving force that has stopped her from engaging in any actions that might corrupt that process. This implies that she has a strong sense of moral principles and values, which she actively adheres to in her actions and choices. If we examine the hypothesis, \\"If she lacked integrity, she might corrupt the process,\\" it poses an alternate scenario in which her integrity is absent or significantly diminished. In such a situation, the moral force that currently restrains her from corrupting the process would no longer act upon her, leaving room for the possibility of negative or harmful actions that might corrupt the process. This hypothetical scenario is a logical extension of the original premise: if her integrity is what presently prevents her from corrupting the process, it stands to reason that a lack of integrity would remove that barrier and possibly permit her to engage in corrupt practices.

In Rugby Union what position does the number 15 play?","completion":"In Rugby Union, the number 15 jersey is worn by the player who plays the position of Fullback. The Fullback is the last line of defense and plays a crucial role both in defense and attack. This position is known for its versatility, as the player needs to possess a wide range of skills and abilities to contribute effectively to the team. Basically, the Fullback is responsible for the following tasks: 1. Fielding kicks: The Fullback stands at the back of the field to collect deep kicks from the opposition. They must be able to judge where the ball will land and sprint to reach the ball in time. They must also be proficient in catching high balls securely, to avoid fumbling and providing attacking opportunities to the opponent. 2. Counter-attacking: One of the primary duties of a Fullback is to counter-attack and initiate attacking plays. After fielding a kick, they must assess the situation quickly and decide whether to kick the ball back, pass it to a teammate, or make a run with the ball themselves. Quick decision-making is vital in this scenario. 3. Kicking: Fullbacks are often skilled kickers with strong kicking abilities. They are usually called upon for tactical kicks, such as long punts down the field to relieve pressure or gain territory, and for goal kicks. Effective kicking skills can help change the flow of the game, so Fullbacks must be consistently accurate when striking the ball. 4. Last line of defense: As the last defensive player on the team, Fullbacks need to be excellent tacklers. They should be able to bring down opponents making a break through the defensive line by anticipating their movement and using strong tackling technique. 5. Positioning: Fullbacks must have a deep understanding of the game and constantly manage their positioning on the field. They need to anticipate where the attack will occur and move accordingly to support their teammates and cover potential gaps in the defensive line. 6. Communication: Fullbacks are often the eyes and ears of the team, as they have a clear view of the entire field from their position. They must communicate effectively with their team, especially the defensive line, to alert them of incoming threats and help organize defensive strategies. 7. Agility and speed: Fullbacks need to have excellent agility and speed, as they often confront opponents in one-on-one situations during counter-attacks or defensive maneuvers. They must be able to change direction quickly, accelerate, and evade tackles to be successful in these situations. 8. Support play: Fullbacks are also expected to support their teammates in both attack and defense scenarios, providing an extra option in terms of passing, offloading, and overlapping runs. In conclusion, the Fullback, wearing the number 15 jersey in Rugby Union, is a versatile player who contributes significantly to both offensive and defensive aspects of the game. They require a range of skills, such as strong catching, kicking, tackling, and agility, as well as decision-making abilities and a thorough knowledge of the game. The Fullback's performance can have a significant impact on the overall outcome of a match."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The recent signing of former Rangers midfielder, Kyle Hutton, by Dumbarton -- following his release from St Mirren -- belongs to the latter category, sparking notable interest in Scotland’s football community. Kyle Hutton's football journey saw another significant twist this week. After a rather interesting stint with St Mirren, the Glasgow-born midfielder now sets his sights on his next challenge as he joins the Dumbarton Football Club, an announcement that comes as a strong statement by the team to their rivals in the upcoming Scottish League One season. Hutton, an experienced candidate with noteworthy accomplishments including his time at Rangers FC, has seen numerous ups and downs throughout his career. With seven seasons at Rangers that included loan spells to Partick Thistle and Dunfermline, he had significant exposure to playing in both the Scottish and English leagues. In 2015, he made a move to Queen of the South, where he played a pivotal role in the midfield over two seasons. This was followed by a switch to St Mirren in 2017. His tenure at St Mirren was marked by a series of strong performances that helped the team win the Scottish Championship in the 2017-2018 season. However, for reasons best known to the management, St Mirren released Hutton at the end of last season, making him a free agent. This allowed Dumbarton, a fellow member of the Scottish League One, to make their move. The club was quick to spot the opportunity and moved swiftly to complete the signing process. Hutton’s addition to the squad is expected to bolster Dumbarton’s midfield, providing a much-needed stability in the centre of the park. The club, which has been striving to climb the ladder of the Scottish League One, will likely benefit from his experience and leadership. Hutton’s experience playing with top-tier teams like Rangers and St Mirren will prove invaluable for Dumbarton. Despite the rigours of the game and the pressures of performing at the highest level, Hutton has consistently displayed professionalism, leadership, and a knack for overcoming challenges. Dumbarton’s manager will no doubt hope to harness these qualities to improve the team's standing in the league. The blend of young talent and experienced players like Hutton creates an intriguing mix at Dumbarton and it will be fascinating to see how this impacts their performance in the forthcoming season. In conclusion, the signing of Kyle Hutton signifies a new chapter in the player's career. It also brings newfound hope and expectation to Dumbarton and their fans. Who knows what the next season holds in store, but this move underlines the ambition of the club and marks their clear intention to make waves in the forthcoming Scottish League One campaign. As Hutton adjusts to his new surroundings and prepares for his debut in a Dumbarton jersey, fans, teammates, and the general football community will be eagerly watching to see what this talented midfielder will bring to his new club. His experience and ability promise exciting times ahead for Dumbarton FC."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: THELANDLORD Mrs Gloria Black of 6 Sutton Road,Cambridge CB5 7AQ THE TENANTMarinaKahn PROPERTY 24a WoodRoad, CambridgeCB2 8BG TOGETHER WITH CONTENTS (fixtures, furniture and equipment) specified in the inventory (attached) TERMfrom 1 st January 20 _ to 31 st December20 _ (12months) RENTPS500 per calendarmonth, payablein advance onthefirst day of eachmonth DEPOSITPS500, payable on commencement ofthis Agreement AGREEMENTS A The Landlord may re-enter the Property and terminate this Agreement if the Rent or any part ofit is not paidwithinfourteen daysafterit becomes due.

What is the best way to: Adding the pictures to bottle caps","completion":"Adding pictures to bottle caps can be a fun and creative way to personalize and enhance various DIY projects. These custom bottle caps can be used as unique keepsakes, handmade gifts, promotional items, or decorations for events such as weddings, birthdays or parties. To create the perfect personalized bottle caps with pictures, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather the required materials: - Blank bottle caps: Select new or recycled soda or beer bottle caps. - Images: Choose printed images, photos, or designs you’d like to attach to the bottle caps. The images should be small enough to fit inside the bottle cap yet large enough to cover required space; usually a 1-inch diameter is ideal. - Scissors or a 1-inch circle hole punch. - Adhesive: A glue stick, or double-sided sticky tape. - Clear Epoxy Resin or clear Epoxy stickers/domes. - Pliers (for bending, if necessary). - Optional: Beads, glitter, small charms, or other decorative items for added embellishments. - Optional: Jewelry findings (jump rings, chains, etc.) if you're making bottle cap jewelry. 2. Prepare bottle caps: If you're using used bottle caps, clean them thoroughly, removing any residue or debris. Make sure they are completely dry before proceeding. Flatten the edges of the bottle caps with pliers if you desire a flat surface or leave them curved for a more traditional look. 3. Select and cut images: Choose the images, photos, or designs you want to attach to your bottle caps and cut them into 1-inch circles using scissors or a circle hole punch. Make sure the images are crisp and clear since they will be the focal point of your bottle cap creation. 4. Attach the image to the bottle cap: Use a glue stick or double-sided sticky tape to secure the image inside the bottle cap. Apply a thin layer of adhesive to the backside of the image and firmly press it into the bottle cap. Make sure to smooth out any air bubbles and that the image is placed evenly with no overhang or gaps. 5. Seal the image: Once the adhesive is dry, you have two options to seal the image: a) Epoxy Resin: Pour a small amount of clear epoxy resin over the image, filling the bottle cap completely. Carefully spread the resin to the edges, ensuring it covers the entire picture. Allow the resin to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically 24-48 hours. b) Epoxy Stickers/Domes: Alternatively, you can use a pre-made clear epoxy sticker/dome. Peel off the adhesive backing and carefully place the sticker on top of the image, making sure it covers the entire picture and adheres to the edge of the bottle cap. 6. Add embellishments (optional): If you're looking for a more decorative touch, add beads, glitter, or small charms to the design before the resin dries or press them gently into the adhesive layer of the epoxy sticker. 7. Attach findings (if applicable): If you intend to use the personalized bottle caps as jewelry pieces, add jump rings or chains once the epoxy resin has fully cured. Attach these findings through a hole punched at the edge of the bottle cap, and your custom bottle cap is now ready to be a part of a necklace, bracelet, or other wearable accessory. Remember that practice makes perfect, so try different designs, techniques, and materials until you perfect the process. Now go ahead and create your unique personalized bottle caps, perfect for any occasion or purpose. Enjoy your crafting journey!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

Movie title: Drop Zone Context: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Matt Lauer is denying claims that he had an affair with celebrity chef Giada De Laurentis. The married Today show host said he never had a sexual relationship with the 44-year-old and says their long-term friendship is why they have been recently spotted together. He hit out at allegations that he was one of the reasons why the celebrity chef had recently split from her husband. De Laurentis also denies the claim. Speaking to TMZ following his arrival at LAX on Saturday, he said: 'There is no truth to that story.' 'From the horse's mouth we have been friends for 10 years and more importantly I feel bad for what she has been going through.' De Laurentiis recently announced her split from husband Todd Thompson after 11 years of marriage last week - but she denied it was because of Lauer. Strictly platonic: Matt Lauer has denied ever having an affair with celebrity chef Giada De Laurentis saying they have been 'friends for 10 years' Sympathy: The Today show host, pictured cooking with the celebrity chef, says he 'feels bad' for De Laurentis following the split from her husband of 11 years. Lauer has been married to Annette Roque, his second wife, since 1998. The Dutch former model is the mother of his three children. Then there were also rumors concerning fellow chef Bobby Flay, after the pair were seen dining together in New York just days before the 44-year-old Food Network star announced her breakup at the end of December. However Giada has now said any suggestions of romance involving the two - which first surfaced in Star magazine - were false. 'My long-time friendships with my co-workers Matt Lauer and Bobby Flay are exactly that — long-time friendships,' she said in a statement to website Gossip Cop. 'There has never been a romantic relationship with these two men,' she added. Giada and her husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson, separated in July but only announced the split last week. The couple have a six-year-old daughter, Jade. Their separation comes three years after Giada was forced to deny claims she had been cheating on Todd with musician John Mayer, 37. Lauer took to the red carpet at the Golden Gloves with Today show co-cost Savannah Guthrie at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Denial: Three years before announcing her split from husband Todd Thompson, Giada De Laurentiis was forced to deny claims she had hooked up with John Mayer. Speaking to Redbook magazine about the claims in 2011, Giada called it unexpected and insisted nothing had happened with the Your Body Is A Wonderland singer. Star magazine reported that the duo had a 'steamy hookup' at the Gansevoort Hotel in New York, in 2010 but Giada revealed her husband was actually in New York with her when she was alleged to have been with John. And she revealed Todd's embarrassment that his family in Michigan might believe it was true. She told Redbook: 'I was shocked. And not so much for me, but for my husband and family. My family is used to that sort of thing. But my husband's family is not. Todd was embarrassed that his family in Michigan would see it and think, What is going on over there in Hollywood?' Giada admitted she had met John in the past but insisted it was nothing more than a brief introduction and she hadn't seen him in three years before the alleged fling took place. John's rep also told E! News: 'The claims are absolutely ridiculous.' Giada's representative told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'She barely knows John Mayer. She met him at an event and chatted with him for about five minutes and that is the extent of her contact with him.' Separate paths: Giada and Todd, shown in February in New York City, separated back in July. The chef and Todd appear to be having an amicable split, with Giada writing on Facebook: 'After an amicable separation since July, Todd and I have decided to end our marriage. Although our decision to separate comes with a great deal of sadness, our focus on the future and overwhelming desire for our family's happiness has given us the strength to move forward on separate, yet always connected paths. 'Todd and I share a beautiful daughter and a lifetime of great memories that we both treasure more than anything. We are so thankful for our friends and family, and really appreciate the support in this time of change,' she added. The statement did not mention if divorce proceedings had started. 'Thanks so much for your support in this time of change...', Giada tweeted on Monday night to her more than one million followers on Twitter. The couple were married in May 2003. Giada won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2008 for Outstanding Lifestyle Host for her show Giada At Home. Happier times: Giada is shown with Todd and their daughter Jade in February in Miami Beach, Florida. She was born in Rome, Italy and her maternal grandfather is the noted Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis whose producing credits include the Fellini films La Strada and Nights Of Cabiria and the 1992 cult classic Army Of Darkness. After her parents' divorce, she and her siblings moved to Southern California, where they grew up. Giada graduated from UCLA in 1996 with a degree in social anthropology. Along with her cooking show and contributions to the Today show, Giada also came out with a line of kitchen supplies for Target in 2010. Television chef: Giada is shown in an undated file photo from her show Giada At Home. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Matt Lauer, who is a host on the Today show, and Giada De Laurentiis, a celebrity chef, are both saying that they did not have an affair.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\". - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals. - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius. - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen. - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage. - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent. - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors. - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)). - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen . - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\". - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine. - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam. - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium. - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe. - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state. - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture. What is the relationship between 'caesium chromate' and 'yellow'? A:","completion":"Caesium chromate (Cs2CrO4) is a chemical compound of caesium, chromium, and oxygen. It forms yellow-colored crystals which can be associated with the color yellow. The yellow color of caesium chromate is due to the presence of the chromate ion (CrO4^2-), which is known for giving a yellow color to compounds that contain it. The relationship between caesium chromate and the color yellow can be further explained by understanding how colors are produced in chemical compounds. In many cases, color in inorganic compounds arises from the absorption of certain wavelengths of light by the compound's electrons, which causes a transition of the electrons between different energy levels. The remaining wavelengths that are not absorbed are transmitted or reflected, and this is what we perceive as the color of the substance. In the case of caesium chromate, the yellow color results from the electronic transitions within the chromate ion (CrO4^2-), as the compound absorbs light in the blue and violet regions of the visible light spectrum. The light that remains and is transmitted or reflected constitutes the complementary color, which in this case is yellow. In summary, the relationship between caesium chromate and the color yellow lies in the presence of the chromate ion, which imparts the yellow color to the compound due to its electronic transitions and absorption of specific wavelengths of light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Article: Can you imagine a stranger will read your e-mails without your permission or scan the website you've visited or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchases or cell phones bills? All of the things may happen to you one day. In fact, it's likely that some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permission? It might be a spouse, a girlfriend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen or even do something that may bring a disaster to you. Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, and that it's important to reveal to friends, family and lovers at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain nowadays. The digital bread crumbs you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to know who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can leak the deepest thought in your mind. Like it or not, increasingly _ The key question is: Does that matter? For many Americans, the answer apparently is \\"No\\". When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most of them say they are really concerned about losing it. And 60 percent of the respondents say they feel their privacy is \\"slipping away, and that bothers me\\". But people say one thing and do another. Only a small of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that track automobile movements. Privacy economist Acquisti has run a series of tests that reveal people will give up personal information such as telephone number, address, or social security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cent-off coupon . But privacy does matter--at least sometimes. It's like health; when you have it, you don't notice it. Only when it's gone do you wish you'd done more to protect it. Without privacy, one will be naked in front of others. Answer: There should be fewer quarrels between friends. A:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the key aspect in the article.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"biomes that have suffered mainly from pollution have water that contains little or no what?\\" is \\"cO 2\\", given that biomes that have suffered mainly from pollution have water that contains little or no salt? OPT: (A). Yes; (B). No; Answer:","completion":"(B). No; The right answer to the question \\"biomes that have suffered mainly from pollution have water that contains little or no what?\\" would not specifically be \\"CO2\\" as indicated, given that biomes that have suffered mainly from pollution have water that contains little or no salt. To better understand and give a detailed answer, it is crucial to clarify the relationship between water pollution, CO2, and salt content in the water. Water pollution happens when harmful substances (like chemicals, waste, or microorganisms) enter water bodies in concentrations that can have negative effects on ecosystems and human health. Although these pollutants might include CO2 (as well as other greenhouse gases) caused by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, pollution encompasses many more contaminants. Some common water pollutants include nutrients (such as fertilizers and animal waste), sewage, microplastics, industrial waste, oil spills, and heavy metals. Now, the relationship between pollution and the salt content in the water. Saltwater pollution can happen when pollutants mix with seawater, harming marine life and disrupting the balance of salt and freshwater in coastal ecosystems. However, water pollution can occur in both saltwater and freshwater environments. In the given context, it is specified that biomes with water pollution have little or no salt content, which likely refers to freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. With this information, it becomes clear that CO2 may be a small contributor to water pollution problems, but it doesn't specifically determine a water body's salt content. Additionally, although CO2 can cause changes in water chemistry (like ocean acidification in marine environments) and indirectly impact the surrounding biomes, it would not be correct to conclude that CO2 is the answer to the question. To answer the question \\"biomes that have suffered mainly from pollution have water that contains little or no what?\\", it is essential to understand that pollution affects different biomes in various ways. Saying that polluted water in these biomes contains little or no salt is not an adequate or generalizable answer. Instead, it would depend on the specific type of biome, the origin and nature of the pollutant source, and the level of pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select from the following. (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","completion":"(iii) No. The statement \\"A man is at a stand looking at produce.\\" refers to a situation where a man is at a stand or stall, such as a farmers market, grocery store or similar location, and he is viewing or examining different types of fruits, vegetables or other produce items available for sale. This suggests that the man is engaged in an activity related to food shopping, or possibly just browsing items available in the market. On the other hand, the statement \\"A man is being pulled by himself\\" is quite vague and could refer to several different scenarios or interpretations, such as the man pulling a wagon, sled or cart by himself or that the man is engaging in some self-propulsion, such as pulling himself across a surface using his upper body strength. However, both of these interpretations appear to be unrelated to the initial situation of a man looking at produce. As such, we can conclude that there is no direct correlation between these two statements, and thus we cannot conclude that \\"A man is being pulled by himself\\" based on the information provided in the single/multi-select question about a man looking at produce. Understanding the context and literal meaning of statements, as well as distinguishing between unrelated scenarios or situations, is an essential aspect of communication, information processing, and decision-making.

In both sentences, the core meaning of \\"dozen\\" as a group of twelve remains the same. However, the way it is used in each sentence differs slightly in terms of plurality and context. In the first sentence, \\"There shouldn't be more than two dozens\\", the word \\"dozen\\" appears in its plural form \\"dozens.\\" This means that we are talking about multiple groups of twelve items, specifically two groups. So, in this context, the speaker is saying that there should not be more than 24 items in total (12 items x 2 groups = 24 items). In the second sentence, \\"Pack the shirts in dozens, please\\", the word \\"dozen\\" is used in the context of packaging. Here, the speaker is requesting the shirts to be packed in groups of twelve. While the core meaning of \\"dozen\\" is still referring to a group of twelve items, the context differs as it now implies an action - packing shirts in groups. In this sentence, it is unspecified how many dozens should be packed, but the emphasis is on the arrangement of twelve items per package or group. So, while the definition of \\"dozen\\" meaning a group of twelve items remains consistent, the way it is applied in each sentence varies slightly in terms of plurality and context. The first sentence refers to a specific number of dozens (two), while the second sentence emphasizes the packaging action in groups of twelve, without specifying a specific number of dozens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses it finds in the telephone directory. It tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car. As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.

Despite his limitations, Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with developmental disabilities, as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest) who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Though Sam provides a loving and caring environment for precocious Lucy, she soon surpasses his mental ability. Other children tease her for having a \\"retard\\" as a father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more intellectually advanced than Sam. On the advice of his friends, Sam approaches a high-powered lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose brusque manner, fast-paced schedule and difficult personal life have earned her a reputation as cold and unfeeling. In an attempt to prove to others that she is not heartless, Rita surprisingly agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono. As they work together to secure Sam's parental rights, Sam unwittingly helps Rita with her family problems, including encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repairing her fractious relationship with her son. She and Sam have an emotional moment together when they reveal that they never feel good enough. At the trial, Sam breaks down after opposing counsel convinces him that he is not capable of being a father.

Question 2: Which is the best phone available in the market irrespective of price? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are similar but not exactly the same. Question 1 asks for the best phones available on the market, which implies a comparison of several top-tier options based on various factors such as specifications, features, and price. On the other hand, Question 2 focuses on identifying the single best phone available in the market without considering the price factor. Before answering both questions, it is essential to note that the smartphone market regularly sees new releases, and the best choices may change rapidly. The following information reflects the top choices available as of 2021. Answer to Question 1: Here is a list of some of the best phones available on the market, considering their features, specifications, and price: 1. Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max: - The most recent addition to the iPhone family boasts the new A15 Bionic chip, ProMotion display, improved camera system, and larger battery life. The iPhone 13 Pro Max sports a resounding 6.7-inch display, while the iPhone 13 Pro is available with a 6.1-inch display. 2. Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra: - The Galaxy S21 Ultra is a powerful Android flagship with top-of-the-line performance. It is equipped with a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display, the Exynos 2100/Snapdragon 888 chipset, up to 16GB RAM, and a 108MP quad-camera setup. The device has a sleek and sturdy design combined with excellent battery life. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro: - Google's latest flagship offers excellent software and camera performance. It has a 6.7-inch LTPO OLED display, Google Tensor chipset, 12GB RAM, and a 50MP main camera with exceptional low-light performance. 4. OnePlus 9 Pro: - The OnePlus 9 Pro is a flagship smartphone that features a 6.7-inch Fluid AMOLED display, the Snapdragon 888 chipset, up to 12GB RAM, a 48MP main camera setup with Hasselblad collaboration, and 65W fast charging. 5. Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra: - This flagship smartphone boasts a 6.81-inch AMOLED display, Snapdragon 888 chipset, up to 12GB RAM, a 50MP main camera, and 67W fast charging. It also packs a unique feature: a secondary rear display to help with selfies using the main camera system. Answer to Question 2: Determining the best phone available in the market irrespective of price is subjective, as it depends on individual preferences and priorities. As of 2021, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra are contending for the top position due to their superior performance, build quality, camera capabilities, and battery life. The choice between iOS and Android, as well as the importance of specific features and ecosystem preferences, will impact an individual's decision regarding the best phone irrespective of price."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The 18-meter-tall Rubber Duck arrived in Beijing on Friday. It was placed on waters in the International Garden Expo Park, where the Yongding River passes through. The Rubber Duck exhibition was designed by Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman. It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends. Zhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey. \\"I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it. It's great that the duck is in Beijing,\\" Zhao said. Before arriving in Beijing, the Rubber Duck traveled to 13 cities in nine countries. \\"The aim of the Rubber Duck is simply to bring everyone back to their childhood again,\\" said Zeng Hui, a leader of the Beijing Design Week Organizing Committee Office. \\"It can be a toy for adults.\\" ,.

After a mysterious series of accidents occur on the sets of his latest project, critics and fans start questioning his dedication and morals as a filmmaker. The movie opens with Aditya on the verge of starting the shoot for his most ambitious and personal film yet - a modern-day adaptation of the classic Greek tragedy \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A-listers have been cast, extravagant sets have been built, and excitement in the industry is at an all-time high. Although there is immense pressure on Aditya, he is exceptionally focused on bringing his vision to life. However, things take a turn for the worse when a massive fire breaks out on set, causing damage and delays in the production. Even though the fire is labeled as a mere accident, Aditya is rattled by the occurrence. He begins to dive into his current film's subject matter, looking for answers in the tragic tale itself. As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that a mysterious saboteur is intentionally trying to ruin Aditya's film. Each \\"accident\\" relates to a specific scene or theme in the tragedy, causing both confusion and fear amongst the cast and crew members. Aditya's once vision-driven cast and crew lose their faith in him, fueling rumors about his erratic behavior. In a race against time, Aditya is forced to juggle directing his masterpiece and peeling back layers of deception, all while trying to protect his career from scandal. Suspecting someone on his team is responsible, he finds himself questioning everything and everyone. While the movie reaches its dramatic climax, Aditya discovers the saboteur to be his long-time rival and friend-turned-enemy, Arjun, a fellow director who was always jealous of Aditya's success. Arjun confesses that he orchestrated the accidents in an attempt to ruin Aditya's career and reputation. In a shocking twist, however, Aditya's film manages to transcend all odds and becomes an enormous success, with audiences praising his ability to convey emotions amid chaos. \\"The Spectacle of Fate\\" ultimately poses the question of whether destiny can be shaped by our actions or if it is inevitably pre-determined. Ironically, Aditya becomes the living embodiment of a modern Oedipus, grappling with the God-given tragedy both in his work and personal life. As the movie concludes, Aditya finds an even deeper appreciation of the ancient story he loves, as he discovers that regardless of divine intervention or human manipulation, the drive to create and shape one's own destiny always prevails."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Tanya yelled at Carrie because","completion":"she felt overwhelmed by the way Carrie had been treating her lately. Carrie, on the other hand, had been under a lot of personal and professional stress and was completely oblivious to how her actions affected others, especially Tanya. Over the past few weeks, Tanya had taken note of how Carrie criticized her ideas, dismissed her concerns, and consistently took credit for their joint projects. Whenever they worked together, Carrie dominated the conversation, always insisting that her approach was the correct way, leaving Tanya feeling belittled and unimportant. Feeling hurt and disrespected, Tanya reached her breaking point. One morning, Carrie interrupted Tanya in the middle of a presentation to their team, pointed out an insignificant error on one of the slides, and proceeded to give her unsolicited advice on how to improve the presentation. This interruption, although perhaps not maliciously intended by Carrie, triggered Tanya's anger. As the room fell silent amidst the awkward tension, Tanya couldn't help but raise her voice and express her frustration to Carrie. The words just seemed to pour out without any filter, as she listed all the instances where she felt mistreated and undermined by her colleague. Carrie, taken aback by Tanya's raw emotions, sulked in her chair with an embarrassed expression on her face. This was the first time someone had called her out on her behavior so publicly, and it made her realize that there was merit in Tanya's concerns. The realization dawned on her that she'd not only been treating Tanya poorly but possibly others as well. She started to contemplate how her words and actions could impact their relationships and create a toxic work environment. After the incident, Tanya and Carrie had a private conversation to discuss their feelings and thoughts on the issue. Tanya explained how Carrie's constant criticism and belittling had damaged her confidence. She also pointed out how Carrie's stress could be leaking into her day-to-day interactions with her colleagues, which only served to alienate others and make an already tense atmosphere even worse. Carrie listened carefully, taking the time to reflect on Tanya's words. She admitted to being unaware of how her behavior affected her colleagues and apologized sincerely for how she'd treated Tanya. Carrie vowed to be more mindful of her actions and to make a better effort to communicate and collaborate with her team members. Although their relationship was strained, the confrontation prompted Carrie to make a conscious decision to change her behavior. She began to seek healthier ways to manage her stress, such as engaging in regular exercise, seeking therapy, and prioritizing her well-being. Over time, the working environment started to improve. Carrie gradually made positive changes, and Tanya noticed the effort her colleague was making in being more considerate and respectful. While it took some time, trust started to rebuild between them, allowing them to collaborate effectively and develop a better understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. This experience proved to be a valuable lesson for both Tanya and Carrie, as they realized the importance of open communication, empathy, and the impact they had on others' well-being. It also highlighted the necessity of addressing interpersonal issues head-on rather than bottled up inside. Although it was a difficult and emotional process, ultimately, it led to growth and a more harmonious work environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Bowing evolved as a traditional sign of respect and acknowledgement in many Western cultures, but it is much less common than it once was. You may still bow to show respect, or to add a dramatic flourish to a situation, but the gesture will appear a bit outdated. That said, bowing is still generally regarded as a polite gesture. Bowing in western culture is often accompanied by an air of mock formality, and perhaps a degree of ironic self-consciousness. The European-American ceremonial bow is largely an anachronistic gesture, so bear in mind that you may not be taken seriously. Try owning the mock formality of the bow by playing with nuance and taking the gesture to the extreme. Bow very slowly and deeply to show sarcasm—something like a slow clap. Bow very quickly and politely to convey mock deference. Bend your arm at the elbow, and rest your hand (palm out( at waist-level. Alternately, press your left hand across your abdomen. Bend your arm at the elbow. Hold your palm against your body while you tip your upper body forward. The lower you bend, the more respect you show. If you are wearing a hat, remove it and hold it by the brim in your right hand. If you are in a situation that calls for extreme deference—say, a funeral, or the performance of a national anthem—tuck your hat under your arm until the moment passes. Do not raise your chin to maintain eye contact—this may be taken as a sign of disrespect. This is, however, a tradition that evolved from a highly stratified feudal society, so do not expect most 21st-century people to take offense if you make eye contact or bow \\"incorrectly\\". Straighten your back. Drop your hands. Raise your eyes to meet the gaze of the person to whom you bowed, and proceed to speak with them. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the evolution and current relevance of bowing in Western cultures, highlighting its decrease in popularity, but noting its continued perception as a polite gesture.

There are now an additional six miles of streets that have been deemed officially polluted in the capital. Tourist areas Princes Street, George Street, most of the Royal Mile and the Grassmarket are all now included. Edinburgh City Council said it was looking at ways to cut pollution in the busiest parts of the city. Gorgie Road, London Road and some of Easter Road also make up the additional six miles of polluted streets. The city council is extending its existing three air pollution problem zones: central, St Johns Road and Great Junction Street and adding two new ones at Inverleith Row and Glasgow Road. The Cowgate, the Grassmarket, most of Gorgie Road, London Road and the top of Easter Road will be added to the central zone. The Great Junction Street zone has had Bernard Street, Commercial Street and North Junction Street added. Dr Richard Dixon, Friends of the Earth Scotland's director, said: \\"Having to include even more streets in the pollution zones is a sure sign that a decade's worth of action plans have failed. \\"Pollution from cars, vans, buses and lorries are still making the capital's air bad for our health and the council needs to take urgent action on transport to bring Edinburgh's air up to scratch. \\"We need fewer and cleaner vehicles, as well as more action on public transport, walking and cycling.\\" Councils are obliged to declare air pollution problem zones for locations where European, UK or Scottish air quality targets are not going to be met.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. human being B. bar C. haunted saloon D. graveyard E. haunted house A:","completion":"Based on the context given in the question, the spirit saw other like beings wandering aimlessly, which suggests that the setting in which the spirit finds itself is likely to be a place that has other spirits or entities similar to itself. The most suitable option among the choices that correspond to an environment frequented by spirits would be D. graveyard. A graveyard, also known as a cemetery, is a place where the remains of deceased individuals are buried or interred. Throughout history, graveyards have been linked with stories of hauntings, apparitions, and other supernatural occurrences. This association is primarily due to the fact that graveyards are resting places for the dead, and it is believed that many spirits linger around the location of their physical remains. As the question states that the spirit sees other like beings, it is likely they are all in the same supernatural realm together, and a graveyard is often believed to be the converging point for many spirits and entities. The reason for their aimless wandering could be due to their unfinished business in the earthly realm or disorientation resulting from their passing. The other options provided do not seem as suitable for this scenario: A. human being - This option is not a location; rather, it is an individual, and it is not applicable to the context of the question. B. bar - A bar is typically a social setting where living humans gather for drinks and entertainment. It would be unusual for a spirit to observe other similar entities in a bar as they usually don't engage in such earthly activities, and the atmosphere doesn't correspond with the description provided. C. haunted saloon - While a haunted saloon might have some spirits, this location mainly serves as a gathering place for living humans. It would be less likely for the spirit to observe numerous similar entities wandering aimlessly in this type of environment. E. haunted house - Although this option is a plausible location for spirits, it's less suitable compared to the graveyard. Haunted houses typically have a limited number of spirits that might be attached to the specific building or its history. Graveyards, on the other hand, are more likely to have a larger gathering of spirits from various backgrounds and time periods, making it a more fitting location for the spirit's observation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. It follows the musical's story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper's heaven, was added. The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of Oklahoma!. It garnered some good reviews, and the soundtrack recording was a best seller. As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of Carousel. Thomas Hischak, in The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, later wondered \\"if the smaller number of Carousel stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering [film] musical\\". There was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet, with choreography by Edward Villella. The New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O'Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Jason Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote, \\"this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.\\" It was broadcast as part of the PBS Live from Lincoln Center series, premiering on April 26, 2013.

Answer the following question: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the respiration process, after carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled, is the transport of oxygen-rich blood back to the various tissues and organs of the body to support their essential functions. After the oxygen fills the sacs (alveoli) in your lungs, it diffuses into the surrounding capillaries where it binds to hemoglobin molecules present in red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood is then carried away from the lungs by the pulmonary veins and transported back to the left atrium of the heart. The oxygen-rich blood then flows into the left ventricle, which contracts and pumps the blood throughout the body via the aorta and the arterial system. This distribution of oxygen-rich blood ensures that cells, tissues, and organs receive the oxygen they require for energy production, growth, and maintenance. Simultaneously, the oxygen-depleted blood (containing high levels of carbon dioxide and other waste products) returns to the heart's right atrium via the venous system. From there, it moves to the right ventricle, which pumps the blood into the pulmonary arteries and back to the lungs. This repeated circulation and exchange of gases between the lungs and the rest of the body is a critical component of the respiratory system. In summary, the last step of the respiration process involves the circulation of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, providing essential nutrients for cellular functions and supporting overall well-being. This cyclical process, together with the removal and exhalation of carbon dioxide, ensures that your body's cells can continuously produce energy and maintain optimal physiological functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identifying the main subjects and actions in both sentences. - In the first sentence, the main subject is \\"the man\\" and the main action is \\"seasoning the sausages.\\" - In the second sentence, the main subject is again \\"the man\\" and the main action is \\"adding seasoning to water in a bowl.\\" Step 2: Comparing the subjects and actions. - The subjects of both sentences are the same, \\"the man.\\" - The actions in both sentences are related but not identical. In the first sentence, the man is seasoning the sausages directly, while in the second sentence, the man is adding seasoning to water in a bowl, which may be used to season the sausages or soak them, but it is not explicitly stated. Based on this analysis, there is significant meaning overlap in the sense that both sentences involve the same subject, seasoning, and food preparation. However, the process of seasoning the sausages is different in both sentences, which prevents them from having the same meaning, and thus results in a 3.5 out of 5 rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Abitibi-Témiscamingue is an administrative region located in southwestern Québec, Canada, along the border with Ontario. It became part of the province in 1898. It has a land area of 57,674.26 km (22,268.16 sq mi). The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture. - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\". - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time. - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa. - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality (Abitibi West) is a regional county municipality located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec. Its seat is La Sarre. - The term regional county municipality or RCM (\\"municipalité régionale de comté, MRC\\") is used in Quebec to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities. In some older English translations they were called county regional municipality. - Macamic is a ville in northwestern Quebec , Canada , in the Abitibi - Ouest Regional County Municipality .

Here is a news article: One-hundred-fifty years after the Hunley made the South proud, the Confederate submarine remains a graceful and formidable machine, its rusted shell continuing to tell tales worthy of the greatest Southern yarn-spinners. Desperation, military stakes, engineering knowhow, and sheer bravery all played a role in the historic moment on Feb. 17, 1864, when eight Confederate navy men cranked the Hunley up to a Union ship called the Housatonic and jammed an explosive into her side in an effort to break the chokehold Union blockade of the critical Southern port of Charleston, S.C. Hunley’s explosive stab was the first time a military submarine ever sank an enemy ship, and it had an immediate and tragic coda: The Hunley and her eight crew also retired to the bottom of Charleston Harbor, from where it was excavated and returned to harbor in 2000 after being found in 1995. The return of the Hunley to land was marked with the pride of cannon fire and cheering crowds, and her treasure was immediate and fulfilling – including the discovery of a bullet-bent coin embossed with the phrase “My life preserver,” as well as buttons, bones and other belongings from the eight-man crew. But it’s taken the ensuing fifteen years for researchers to get close to solving the mystery of why the Hunley sank after dispatching her torpedo with a long spar mounted on its prow. The Hunley was built in Mobile, Alabama, and hauled by train to Charleston. In test runs, it had already killed several crews by the time it struck the Housatonic, but had each time been raised out of the water to try again. Crew members, lit by lantern-light, sat in a tight row – assuredly praying and sweating – as they hand-cranked a propeller while diving as deep as 50 feet. From discovered drawings most experts thought the Hunley was a rude and rudimentary machine, so researchers were shocked at its graceful lines and the ingenuity of its engineering. “A real surprise was that the submarine was far more technically advanced than anybody had ever thought,” the novelist Clive Cussler, who helped find the ship, told the Monitor in 2001. Scientists say they’re still not 100 percent sure why the Hunley sank, but last year researchers announced a new theory. While the torpedo sat at the tip of a 200-foot spar, evidence shows that the Hunley may have been as few as 20 feet from the Housatonic’s hull when the blast went off. Judging by damage to the spar, researchers suggest the explosion may have knocked the crew unconscious and the boat to the bottom. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy Previous theories had suggested that the Hunley’s crew ran out of air before they could return to harbor. Put to rest in 2004, the eight crew members were the last Confederates to be buried from the war. On Monday night, military reenactors will gather at the Hunley’s launching spot, to commemorate the achievement of the pioneering sub and her brave crew. ||||| On the clear but chilly night of February 17, 1864, John Crosby stood on the deck of USS Housatonic a little less than six miles and three years removed from the launching point of the Civil War, Fort Sumter. The moonlight shimmered on Charleston Harbor’s still surface as Housatonic patrolled the South Carolina waters as part of the Union naval blockade that was slowly strangling the Confederacy. As Crosby gazed out at the placid harbor around 8:45 p.m., Housatonic’s officer of the deck suddenly saw something shatter the water’s glassy surface only 100 yards away on the starboard side. At first, Crosby thought it could be a surfacing porpoise or perhaps a log. But as the murky shadow rippled closer to the warship, the Navy officer sounded the alarm as he realized that the strange object closing in on Housatonic was actually a cutting-edge naval weapon—a submarine. Based on information gleaned from Confederate deserters, Union ships had been on alert for undersea vessels lurking in Charleston Harbor. Only four months before, USS New Ironsides had been partially damaged in an attack by the semi-submersible CSS David, and this windless, moonlit winter night offered perfect conditions for operating the approaching submarine, H.L. Hunley. As all hands raced to their stations on Housatonic, seven Confederate sailors inside the primitive submarine turned a handcrank that powered the propeller as another man steered toward the 1,240-ton sloop-of-war. Even if they hadn’t been bearing down on a mighty warship, the eight men were already undertaking a dangerous mission simply by being inside the submarine that had already claimed the lives of 13 men, including its inventor, during training exercises. The undersea vessel had been privately constructed in Mobile, Alabama, based on the plans of marine engineer Horace Lawson Hunley. Although Crosby initially thought he spotted a porpoise, the submarine more closely resembled a whale. It was constructed out of a 40-foot-long cylindrical iron steam boiler with a tapered bow and stern. After successful tests on the Mobile River, the submarine was transported to Charleston in August 1863 amid hopes by the Confederate navy that it could be a secret weapon in breaking the Union blockade. Shortly after testing began in Charleston Harbor, five of Hunley’s nine crewmembers drowned when a ship officer accidentally caused the vessel to dive while the hatches were still open. The submarine was salvaged, but less than two months later, a second training accident killed the eight-member crew, including H.L. Hunley himself. Once again, the submarine was pulled to the surface, and even though he knew its tragic history, Lieutenant George Dixon agreed to take command of the vessel in November 1863 and raised a crew of courageous volunteers. As Dixon led his men on the daring attack on Housatonic, he carried with him his good luck charm, a bent gold coin that had saved his life by slowing a bullet that wounded him two years before at the Battle of Shiloh. Although Confederate P.G.T. Beauregard had instructed Dixon to remain on the surface during any attacks, given Hunley’s previous accidents, most of the submarine still remained below the water line as it moved so close to Housatonic that the warship’s 12 cannons were useless. The captain and crew fired their rifles and shotguns in a futile attempt to halt the approaching vessel, but the bullets merely bounced off Hunley’s armor as a spar torpedo mounted at the end of a 16-foot rod that protruded from the submarine’s bow struck the warship. The spar tore into Housatonic’s starboard quarter near its powder magazine, and the rebel torpedo laden with 135 pounds of gunpowder exploded. Housatonic took on water immediately, and within minutes it was a loss, the first warship to have ever been sunk by a submarine. Most of Housatonic’s 155 crewmembers saved themselves by launching lifeboats or climbing the rigging, which remained above the harbor’s shallow 27-foot depth in time for rescue boats from a nearby Union warship to arrive. Five Union sailors died, but the outcome was even more devastating for the Confederacy as Hunley never returned to port. For the third time, Hunley slipped to the bottom of Charleston Harbor, but exactly why remains a mystery. The undersea vessel could have been fatally damaged in the torpedo explosion, hit by a shot from Housatonic or sucked into the vortex of the sinking warship. In 1995, the submarine was located beneath sand and shells by novelist Clive Cussler’s National Underwater and Marine Agency. Five years later, the well-preserved wreck of Hunley, with its eight crew still at their stations and Dixon still with his lucky coin, was raised from its murky grave and brought to the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston where it was placed in a 90,000-gallon freshwater conservation tank. The crew of Hunley were given a proper burial in 2004, and an international team of scientists studying the wreck believe they are close to solving the mystery of what happened to them in the final moments of their daring mission. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The H.L. Hunley, a Confederate submarine, made history on February 17, 1864, by becoming the first military submarine to sink an enemy ship, the Union's Housatonic, during the American Civil War. The attack helped break the Union's naval blockade of Charleston, South Carolina. However, the Hunley itself sank after the attack, taking its eight crew members with it. The submarine was discovered in 1995 and raised from the ocean floor in 2000. Since then, researchers have been trying to uncover the reason behind its sinking. A recent theory suggests that the explosion from the torpedo attack may have knocked the crew unconscious and caused the submarine to sink. The H.L.

Giant Octopus Context: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"...

Plot title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers.

Background Paragraph: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).","completion":"Once upon a time, in a little village called Stonybrook, nestled at the base of the mighty Snowlash Mountain, lived a young shepherd named Liam. Liam was well-known for his expert herding skills and his ability to move his sheep through the most treacherous terrain with ease. Stonybrook was a picturesque village surrounded by the stunning Cordilleran mountain range, a place where alpine tundra thrived. Every summer, Liam would lead his flock to the verdant grasslands above the treeline to graze. The slopes teemed with life, and his sheep grew healthy and strong feeding on the fresh bounty of the alpine tundra. The villagers admired Liam's dedication and praised his careful selection of grazing grounds, which appeared to be much better than others who followed the same challenging route. One year, as summer approached, Stonybrook was struck by unseasonably warm weather. The heat caused rapid melting of the snow, leading to massive flooding. The villagers had no choice but to move their entire settlement to safer grounds. After days of searching, they discovered a previously uncharted mountain that offered higher elevation and protection from the floods. By sheer coincidence, this peak belonged to the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, far from their familiar Cordilleran mountain range. With no time to waste, the villagers hastily settled down in their new land. Summer was rapidly approaching, and the sheep needed to be taken to fresh pastures. Liam volunteered to explore the mountain, aiming to find the perfect grazing land for his sheep. He understood the delicate balance of slopes, ridges, and elevation that made up the alpine tundra, as well as the importance of aspect in determining the treelines. After days of exploration, Liam noticed that, despite being in a different continent, the treeline had similar characteristics to those in Snowlash Mountain. This gave him some reassurance in finding grazing grounds that would suit his sheep's needs perfectly. He finally discovered a plateau bathed by warm equator-facing slopes, where the treeline rose just enough, and the abundance of alpine tundra offered ideal nourishment for the sheep. With a tremendous sense of accomplishment, Liam led his sheep up the mountain to their new grazing grounds. Word spread quickly, and soon, other shepherds followed suit. It wasn't long until Stonybrook became known not only for its resilient villagers but also for their adaptation to life in the mysterious and majestic mountain range. One day, a curious traveler asked Liam, \\"What is the secret to your remarkable success in shepherding?\\" Liam responded with a twinkle in his eye, \\"By understanding the world around us and paying attention to the delicate balance of nature, we can adapt and thrive, no matter where we are.\\" In remote corners of the world, the tale of Liam and the villagers of Stonybrook continues to be a testament to the power of respecting and learning from the complex relationships within the alpine tundra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although \\"lady\\" and \\"woman\\" are not synonymous, they can be often used interchangeably in the context of these sentences. This factor contributes to the similarity in meaning. 2. Verb: Both sentences use a variation of the verb \\"to crack,\\" either in past simple form as \\"cracked\\" in the first sentence or in the present continuous form as \\"is cracking\\" in the second sentence.

Pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund Ed Miliband’s plans to cut university fees. Pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund Ed Miliband’s plans to cut university fees, it emerged last night. The Labour leader is expected to announce details of the party’s policy to lower tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 within days, but is yet to agree with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on how the £2billion scheme could be funded. It emerged last night that one option being considered by Mr Balls is cutting some of the tax breaks handed to people saving for a pension. Pension tax breaks are worth about £24billion in total each year and have already been cut by Chancellor George Osborne. More money could be saved by lowering the £40,000 ceiling on the amount savers can put aside each year tax-free or cutting the lifetime tax-free limit of £1.25million per pension, The Times reported last night. Lord Mandelson weighed into the row yesterday, admitting Mr Miliband’s policy was not yet finished and insisting Labour must say where it will find the money. Otherwise, he said, it would face a ‘credibility gap’ over its plans to cut the deficit. The former business secretary, who was in charge of universities in Gordon Brown’s government, said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Labour could cut funding to the sector. He told academics and university administrators in London: ‘If any reduction in fees is announced, and I’m not assuming that it will be, it’s absolutely vital that replacement funding from taxation is identified and announced at the same time. ‘Not in a generalised way, but in a specific way. Because that will ensure that no credibility gap is opened up either around university funding or the Labour Party’s commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit.’ He supported Government claims that the rise to £9,000 fees had not led to a fall in applications, pointing out that even the poorest students were now more likely to apply. Lord Mandelson also said cutting fees for UK students could increase the rate at which universities recruit from abroad to plug the funding gap – potentially ‘at the expense’ of home applicants. When he campaigned for the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband proposed a graduate tax as an alternative to tuition fees. But Labour is yet to agree on its stance ahead of the election.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said cutting fees to £6,000 would be ‘foolish’, costing £10billion over five years. ‘[It] would be a populist gesture which would achieve nothing and do a lot of damage,’ he wrote to Mr Miliband. Critics of cutting fees point out that the benefits would mainly go to the highest-earning graduates as they would end up paying less. A Labour Party spokesman said its policy on university fees would be ‘set out shortly’. n A pact between Labour and the SNP would be ‘the ultimate nightmare scenario’ that could break up Britain, David Cameron warned yesterday. He accused a ‘spineless’ Ed Miliband of betraying the Union by refusing to rule out a deal with the Scottish Nationalists. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Ed Miliband plans to cut university fees from £9,000 to £6,000, and to fund this, one option being considered by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls includes cutting some of the tax breaks for pensioners. This could involve lowering the £40,000 ceiling on tax-free savings or cutting the lifetime tax-free limit of £1.25 million per pension. Lord Mandelson emphasizes that if this reduction in fees is announced, it is vital that replacement funding from taxation is identified and announced at the same time to maintain credibility. Critics argue that cutting fees would mainly benefit the highest-earning graduates as they would end up paying less.

Place the wood pieces in your hot bar and place the cursor where you want to put a block. Click or press the right trigger button on the controller to place the block. Additionally, make sure that you leave a 3 block space for a door. After making the house's frame, go back to your workbench and open your inventory to craft a wooden table, chair, a door, and enough wall pieces to cover the back of the house enclosure. Once you're done crafting these, make sure that you place them in your inventory. Go inside the house frame/enclosure and place the chair and table in your hot bar. Select the table and place it anywhere inside the enclosure. Then equip the chairs in your hot bar and place them at the ends of the table. Place the wall pieces in your hot bar and equip them. Then place the cursor on an area behind the enclosure and click or press the right trigger to place a piece of wall. Repeat until you cover the entire back of the house. After building the house, go outside and look for slimes. Use your sword to kill as many as you can and then collect the gels that they drop after they die. Slimes are found in all biomes and will spawn during the day. Other than the sword, you can also use your axe and pickaxe to kill these monsters since they're fairly weak. You're usually going to find a couple of slimes in the area where you spawn for the first time in your world. Once you've accumulated to 10 to 15 gel, you can then go back to your workbench. Open up your inventory and craft as many torches as you possibly can. Place the torches in the hot bar and equip them.

The speaker mentions the potential savings of 50 billion in the healthcare system by bypassing costly procedures like surgery and dialysis, which indicates that this may not be the current state of healthcare coverage in the country. As the speaker expresses their intent to \\"offer it to America,\\" this suggests that the improved coverage being discussed is not yet widespread or fully implemented within the country. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state that \\"People are not covered like this in America.\\" It is worth considering the context of this statement before drawing definite conclusions.

WARREN, Ohio – How serious is the Romney campaign about seizing the offense in the Medicare battle? The campaign is dispatching Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, to a Florida retirement community this weekend. Ryan will headline a campaign event at 10 a.m. Saturday in The Villages, the sprawling retirement community frequented by GOP candidates, including by Romney during this year’s primary battle.Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.) greets the crowd at a campaign stop at Walsh University in North Canton, Ohio, on Thursday. (Phil Long - AP) The company that developed The Villages and several members of the family that started it have donated more than 900,000 to Restore Our Future, a group that is running advertising in swing states on Romney’s behalf. Developer H. Gary Morse, who runs the company, is a member of Romney’s Florida finance team and a prolific fundraiser for state Republicans and also for former President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. His father founded the fast-growing, age-restricted community dubbed “Florida’s Friendliest Retirement Hometown.” Ryan will be joined at the event by his mother, Betty Douglas. At a North Canton campaign stop Thursday morning, Ryan for the second time on the campaign trail, said the Medicare fight is one that Republicans welcome. “The president was talking about Medicare yesterday,” Ryan told a crowd of about 1,700 at Walsh University, a small Catholic school. “I’m excited about this. This is a debate we want to have. This is a debate we need to have and this is a debate we’re going to win.” Ryan also is expected to campaign with Romney in New Hampshire on Monday, according to spokesman Ryan Williams. The announcement is somewhat unexpected: the two tentatively had not been expected to campaign together again until after the GOP convention in Tampa, Aug. 27-30 Romney and Ryan held their last campaign event together in High Point, N.C., on Sunday before parting ways; Ryan headed to Iowa while Romney went south to Florida. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The Romney campaign is taking the Medicare debate seriously and is sending Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, to campaign at a Florida retirement community called The Villages. 2. The Villages is a popular campaigning spot for GOP candidates and has strong financial ties to the Romney campaign, with the company and its founding family donating over 900,000 to Restore Our Future, a group running advertising for Romney. 3. Ryan's visit to The Villages is significant because it shows the Republican party's confidence in discussing Medicare, a sensitive issue for many older Americans. Ryan himself states that \\"This is a debate we want to have. This is a debate we need to have and this is a debate we’re going to win.\\" 4. Ryan is also expected to campaign with Romney in New Hampshire after their last joint event was held in High Point, N.C. 5. This information suggests that the Romney campaign is focused on engaging with the older population and discussing Medicare, which is an important issue for many Americans, especially those residing in retirement communities like The Villages, demonstrating their dedication to gaining support from this demographic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes.

The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Leo finally stopped pacing to sweep his eyes over the vacant space . Answer the following question: What can we guess about the Leo 's room ?","completion":"We can make several educated guesses about Leo's room based on the given information: 1. Spaciousness: The fact that Leo was pacing around demonstrates that the room is relatively spacious, providing him with enough space to walk back and forth. 2. Minimalist or Unfurnished: The room is described to have vacant space, which suggests that it may be minimally furnished or decorated. This lack of furniture and decorations contributes to the room's overall sense of emptiness and loneliness. 3. Loneliness: The room is clearly isolating for Leo as it is mentioned that he is sick of the loneliness, meaning there could be a lack of personal touches or comforting items in the room. There may also be a lack of connection to the outside world, making him feel trapped or isolated within his own space. 4. Lack of engaging activities: The fact that Leo feels lonely and sick of his surroundings might suggest that there are limited engaging or entertaining activities available in the room. A lack of devices, books, art supplies, or any other hobbies or interests might contribute to this dissatisfaction. 5. Lighting and ambiance: Although it is not explicitly mentioned, Leo's feeling of loneliness might be partially influenced by the room's lighting and overall ambiance. A poorly lit or dimly lit room can often evoke feelings of solitude and isolation as it may not provide the warmth and comfort typically associated with well-lit, cozy spaces. 6. Limited socialization opportunities: As Leo finds his room to be lonely, it could also signify that it might not be a space where he can easily interact with others or entertain guests. This could be due to a lack of seating options or welcoming atmosphere. In summary, we can guess that Leo's room is spacious and likely minimally furnished or decorated, which leads to a vacant and isolating feel. The room might lack engaging activities and personal touches, contributing to Leo's feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction with his surroundings. The lighting and ambiance might also play a role in how the room feels to Leo, along with limited opportunities for social interaction within the space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

The Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 was fought between Greece and the Turkish National Movement during the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after World War I between May 1919 and October 1922. It is known as the Western Front of the Turkish War of Independence in Turkey and the Asia Minor Campaign or the Asia Minor Catastrophe in Greece. The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, recently defeated in World War I. The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna , on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, Kütahya, Bursa and Eskişehir. Their advance was checked at the Battle of Sakarya in 1921 by forces of the Turkish national movement. The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the recapture of Smyrna by the Turkish forces and the Great Fire of Smyrna. As a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish national movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving East Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Eastern Thrace. Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in a population exchange. For how many years did the Greco-Turkish war last?","completion":"The Greco-Turkish War lasted for approximately three years, from May 1919 to October 1922.

It's like a see-saw. We have to keep it balanced. If we take something from one side, we have to take it from the other side, and if we add something to one side, we have to add it to the other side too. So, our equation is 3426 = 159*z + 1448 - 2792. We are trying to find what 'z' is. Let's first simplify the right side (that's the side after the equals sign) by calculating 1448 - 2792. When we do that, we find it equals -1344. So now our equation looks like this: 3426 = 159*z - 1344. Do you see it? Now, we want to make it easier for us to find 'z'. So, we should get rid of that -1344 from the right side. Since it is a minus (taking away), we will do the opposite to get rid of it, by adding 1344 to both sides. So when we add 1344 to 3426, we get 4770. Now our equation looks like this: 4770 = 159*z. And to find 'z', we need to get rid of that 159 on the right side. It's multiplying 'z', so to get rid of it, we do the opposite, which is divide. So we divide both sides by 159. Once we do that, we get: z = 4770 / 159. I can't do that exact calculation in my head, but when you do it on a calculator, you find that z is approximately 30. So, there we go! Z is about 30!

Background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

The reasoning behind this answer is that Shallow Farm uses organic methods combined with methods from permaculture, which tend to avoid using synthetic fertilizers, such as ones containing nitrogen. In contrast, the Bold Farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, which are identified as a source of nitrogen contamination in bodies of water. Therefore, if less synthetic fertilizer is used, less nitrogen would be washed away and carried to bodies of water.

Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What movie's title does the title of the tenth episode of the eleventh season parody? A:","completion":"To answer this question, I will first provide some information on the TV show in question, identify the title of the tenth episode of its eleventh season, and then recognize the movie's title it parodies. The TV show in question is \\"The Simpsons,\\" a long-running animated sitcom created by Matt Groening. The show revolves around the life of the Simpson family, consisting of the bumbling but loveable father Homer, his wife Marge, and their children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, the series is known for its humor, satirical take on various aspects of society, and frequent pop culture references in the episode titles. The tenth episode of the eleventh season of \\"The Simpsons\\" is titled \\"Little Big Mom.\\" In this episode, Marge takes a vacation, and Homer and the kids are left to fend for themselves at home. Lisa, the intellectual middle child, takes charge and tries to keep the family in order, but Homer's and Bart's antics lead to chaos and a series of events that are both hilarious and somewhat disastrous. The movie title that the episode \\"Little Big Mom\\" parodies is \\"Little Big Man.\\" \\"Little Big Man\\" is a 1970 American western film directed by Arthur Penn and based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Thomas Berger. The movie stars Dustin Hoffman, who plays Jack Crabb, and it is a picaresque comedy-drama that tells the story of a white male child raised by the Cheyenne nation during the 19th century. The film is notorious for its unique perspective on topics like westward expansion, personal identity, and the perception of Native American culture in the United States. In conclusion, the title of the tenth episode of the eleventh season of \\"The Simpsons,\\" \\"Little Big Mom,\\" parodies the title of the 1970 movie \\"Little Big Man.\\" Both titles share the \\"Little Big\\" part, and the parody title replaces \\"Man\\" with \\"Mom\\" to fit with the storyline of the episode, involving Lisa Simpson trying to take over the responsibility of her mother Marge in taking care of the family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning.

The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

Question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older... Question: What does the author believe a patient with new symptoms should do?

The author believes that when patients experience new symptoms, especially aging adults, having bloodwork done can be a helpful step in evaluating their health concerns. Blood tests can provide information related to various issues like anemia, thyroid problems, electrolyte imbalances, infections, and kidney function. The author also recommends that patients should routinely request and keep a copy of their laboratory results for future reference and consultations with different doctors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it does not directly answer the question \\"The present-day population of Ashkenazi Jews is thought to be between which two numbers?\\" To answer this question, we will need to look at relevant statistics and estimates. The overall number of Jewish people in the world is estimated to be around 14.7 million, as of 2020. According to various sources, Ashkenazi Jews constitute approximately 70-75% of the global Jewish population. Based on these estimates, we can now calculate a rough range of the present-day population of Ashkenazi Jews. Lower estimate: 14,700,000 (total Jewish population) × 0.70 (70%) = 10,290,000 Higher estimate: 14,700,000 (total Jewish population) × 0.75 (75%) = 11,025,000 This means that the present-day population of Ashkenazi Jews is thought to be between approximately 10.3 million and 11 million individuals.

New York Knicks forward Michael Beasley (8) draws a blocking foul against Indiana Pacers forward Thaddeus Young (21) during the first quarter at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. (Photo: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports) In the spring of 2016 Michael Beasley returned to the United States after a season playing for the Shandong Golden Stars in the Chinese Basketball Association. He was in Petros Tenn. â âin the middle of nowhere â me my wife my kids some animals. I had to drive 45 minutes away to a local high school to work out â Beasley said â and waiting for an NBA team to sign him for the final 6-7 weeks of the regular season. Beasley had just been named international MVP of the Chinese league averaging 31.9 points 13.4 rebounds 3.8 assists two steals and 1.3 blocks. He worked hard that season ( his second stint in China) became a fan favorite and put himself in position for an NBA return. But there wasnât much interest. âIt was heartbreaking â he said. âI thought in my mind after what I did in China I was going to come back to an NBA team.â The Dallas Mavericks placed a cursory call. âThey just asked me how I felt â Beasley said. âI donât think it got far as interest. My perception precedes me. That phone call was just how I feel what I think.â In China Beasley came to terms with the fact that his NBA prospects had just about vanished. âI was like âOh man my NBA career could be over â â he said. âSo I stopped thinking about the NBA and started thinking about making myself a better player a better person for my situation. Two weeks after he returned from China the Houston Rockets called. He knew interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff from their days with the Minnesota Timberwolves. âI wasnât thinking of Houston being a fit because of them being an analytics team â shooting three-pointers and layups â Beasley said. âMy whole game is mid-range. Houston wasnât on my radar at all.â New York Knicks small forward Michael Beasley (8) reacts during the fourth quarter against the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden. (Photo: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports) The Rockets signed him and Beasley showed he can still play. Before the start of the 2016-17 season the Milwaukee Bucks acquired him and this past summer the New York Knicks signed him. âIf you love to do it do it. Thatâs why I play basketball â Beasley said. âThatâs why being in China was so important. When the NBA was no longer a realistic dream basketball kept me sane. On Thursday Beasley had fans at Madison Square Garden on their feet and chanting âMVP MVP.â In 25 minutes he scored 32 points and collected 12 rebounds in the Knicksâ 102-93 victory against the Boston Celtics. It was his third game with 30 or more points this season. During practices with the Bucks last season the coaching staff didnât know who among Jabari Parker Giannis Antetokounmpo and Beasley was the best scorer. Beasley can still light it up. Scoring was never Beasleyâs issue. A commitment to the defensive end maturity issues and off-the-court problems were his problems. He has had numerous traffic marijuana violations and a sexual assault accusation that never resulted in charges. He hasnât made it easy on himself and he didnât always have it easy â as a talented teen and young NBA player some close to Beasley viewed him as their financial aid.","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket. Leaving the driver to repair the damage, the pair decide to investigate an old ruined chapel nearby, where they discover the witch's coffin in the crypt below. Kruvejan is suddenly attacked by a large bat, and when he beats it to death in his cane, he accidentally smashes the stone cross position over the window. The fragments from the cross smash the glass, enabling Kruvejan to pull away the witch's mask. Her face is sunken and decayed, but is otherwise intact. Gorovek convinces his friend to leave before the driver becomes overly anxious, but unbeknownst to both, blood from a small cut on Kruvejans hand is already working to revive Asa.Outside the chapel, the two doctors are startled by Princess Katia (Barbara Steele in a dual role), the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani).

Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she had while at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with. A young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer Van Heflin from her home town discourages her. I really liked Judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater. Because it is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes Van Heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced. Both Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town, Heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and Heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on Broadway, their respective moms, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington have kept in touch. That's her entrée, but Heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids, but never anyone quite like Lily Mars. No real big song hits came out of Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, though she sings all her numbers. The best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut, Every Little Movement Has A Meaning All Its Own. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where Heflin's show is being produced. Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in grand style with Connie. It's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it. Composer Karl Hoschna had died a long time ago, but lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I'm betting he liked what he heard. European musical star Marta Eggerth is in Presenting Lily Mars as the show's star who's at first bemused, then angry and finally, understanding of Garland and Heflin. She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent. I'm betting MGM didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, though Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he didn't like. Van Heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from Garland and Eggerth. Heflin was just coming off his Oscar for Johnny Eager the previous year and he and Garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team, but they're not bad together. Presenting Lily Mars is a fine showcase for the talents of Judy Garland. And she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with Mickey Rooney.

Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Mike Rozier, running back for the Pittsburg Maulers also played for what other team? Answer:","completion":"Mike Rozier, a talented and accomplished running back, began his professional football career in the United States Football League (USFL) with the Pittsburgh Maulers. He was drafted as the second overall pick in the 1984 USFL Draft by the Maulers and played a single season before the team folded. Following the dissolution of the Pittsburgh Maulers, his rights were picked up by another USFL team, the Jacksonville Bulls. However, Rozier did not play for the Bulls due to contractual disputes. Instead, Rozier entered the National Football League (NFL), where he was drafted in the first round, also as the second overall pick, by the Houston Oilers in the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft. He spent five seasons with the Oilers, from 1985-1990. During his time with the Oilers, Rozier made the Pro Bowl twice, in 1987 and 1988, and became one of the league's most productive running backs. He amassed a total of 3,426 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns during his tenure with Houston. After his time with the Oilers, Rozier joined the Atlanta Falcons in 1990 as a free agent. He only spent one season in Atlanta, but he contributed by providing veteran experience to a young Falcons team.

His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing.

Summarize this article: This trick isn’t as much about levitating an actual coin as it is about the illusion of making the coin invisible, then making it reappear. To begin the trick, you will need to make the coin disappear from your hand. It’s easier to learn with a larger coin like a half-dollar, but you can use a quarter or other similarly large coin. Using a finger palm vanish, pretend to transfer the coin from one hand to the other. The finger palm works like a regular palm, except you keep the coin in place with your two middle fingers. Hold the coin in place between your fingers and the first joints closest to your palm. This part of the trick is similar to a French Drop where you pretend to transfer the coin from one hand to the other while palming the coin in your original hand. While finger palming the coin, bring your empty hand up toward your eye level while you lower the hand with the coin. Rub your fingers together with your empty hand to make it look like you’ve made the coin “vanish”. However, describe to your audience that you’ve simply made the coin invisible. Open your hand to reveal the invisible coin. Here, you can explain how in order to levitate the coin, you have to make it invisible so that it no longer weighs too much to float. Pretend to pick up the coin as if it were there. The next few parts of this trick will require you to be convincing with your space object work. Also note that you are picking up the invisible coin with the hand that is actually holding the coin. Keep your coin in finger palm position, and always angle your hand so the audience can’t see the actual coin. Before doing this trick, practice actually picking up your real coin. Notice how the weight feels in your hand, how your fingers are positioned, and how your hand moves. Pretend as though you were picking up a coin now. Remember what it looked like when you actually picked up a coin. Don’t pinch your fingers together. Even though a coin is thin, there would still be a tiny amount of space in between your fingers when holding one. Remember the weight of the coin as well. Place the invisible coin in the air and let go. Describe that you can simply put the invisible coin in the air where it will hang until you need it. Keep in mind when you do this that you will be finger palming the actual coin. As you place the coin to hang in the air, angle your hand so your audience can see the open palm, but keep the coin covered by holding it in between your fingers. Once you’ve let the invisible hanging coin part of the trick settle in, grab the coin out of the air with your empty hand. Take the invisible coin, paying attention to your space object work, with the hand that you’re not palming the coin in. Raise the hand with the real coin in it up to meet your empty hand. As you do this, keep the coin in your finger palm but tilt your hand just enough so the audience can see that your palm is empty. Describe that whenever you need the coin back, all you have to do is make it reappear. As you place the invisible coin into the palm of the hand that is holding the actual coin, begin to curl your fingers over. As you begin to make a fist, let the coin drop out of the finger palm. It will fall over the index finger of your other hand. With your thumb, pinch the coin in between your thumb and forefinger as your other hand curls around into a fist. You will now be holding the coin in the same hand that you used to grab the invisible coin out of the air with. Open your hand to reveal that the coin has become visible again.","completion":"This is a magic trick that makes it look like you make a coin invisible and then levitate it. You start by hiding the coin in one hand using your fingers, and then pretend to make the coin invisible. Next, you pretend to pick up the invisible coin and place it in the air. To finish the trick, you grab the coin from the air with your other hand and make it visible again. This trick is all about creating an illusion and making it look real by practicing how to hold the coin, moving your hands, and describing what's happening to the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: ATHENS, Aug 17 (Reuters) - With two euros in his pocket, Yorgos Vagelakos, an 81-year-old retired factory worker, scouts the farmer’s market in his working-class Athens neighborhood for anything he can afford. Like most pensioners, he was hit hard by Greece’s economic crisis. Over eight years, the country’s international bailouts took aim at its pension system and more than a dozen rounds of cuts pushed nearly half its elderly below the poverty line. Now, the country is looking to the end of its third and final rescue package next week, but for Vagelakos, there is little to cheer about. “For the oranges I’m going to buy I’ll pay you next week,” he tells a vendor at the market. Half his money has already gone to a few bunches of grapes. “Two euros next week. Will you be here?” he asks, picking up his bag of fruit. The response is affirmative, and he jokes: “Well then I won’t come so I won’t have to pay you!” Reuters first interviewed Vagelakos in 2012, when Greece signed up to a second bailout that saved it from bankruptcy and a euro zone exit. Back then, he was going to the market with 20 euros in his pocket. His monthly income, including his pension and benefits, had been cut to about 900 euros from 1,250 euros. Today it is down to 685 euros and debts are growing, he said. With unemployment reaching almost 28 percent at its peak, a quarter of children living in poverty and benefits slashed, many families grew dependent on grandparents for handouts during the downturn. Vagelakos can no longer support the families of his two sons and can barely cover his and his wife’s needs. “I wake up in the morning to a nightmare,” he said. “How will I manage my finances and my responsibilities? This is what I wake up to every morning.” Sitting at the kitchen table of his modest home, he goes through a notebook listing debts to the pharmacy and others: “36.8 (euros), 47.5 plus 13... If we add to this the rest of the debt that we have to pay, what is left for us to live on?” Pensioners have staged numerous protests against the austerity measures imposed by the bailouts, but although the Greek economy is finally starting to grow again, albeit modestly, they may face yet more pain. Changes to pension regulations mean more cuts are expected in 2019. “The memorandum (bailout) will never end,” Vagelakos said. Referring to a plan by Greece’s European partners to closely monitor its finances after the bailout ends on Aug. 20, he said: “Even if they end in August, we have the permanent surveillance, which is not a memorandum but a continuous memorial service for us.” (Writing by Karolina Tagaris Editing by Gareth Jones) ||||| In this Friday, Aug. 17, 2018 photo Pedestrians walk in Plaka neighborhood of Athens.

(Associated Press) In this Friday, Aug. 17, 2018 photo Pedestrians walk in Plaka neighborhood of Athens. The one area of the economy that's flourishing is tourism, with officials projecting a record-high 32 million arrivals this year. Greeks, however, are finding it increasingly expensive to go on holiday in their own... (Associated Press) ATHENS, Greece (AP) — There'll be no dancing in the moonlit streets of Athens. For all the official pronouncements that Greece's eight-year crisis will be over as its third and last bailout program ends Monday, few Greeks see cause for celebration. Undeniably, the economy is once again growing modestly, state finances are improving, exports are up and unemployment is down from a ghastly 28 percent high. But one in five Greeks are still unemployed, with few receiving state benefits, and underpaid drudgery is the norm in new jobs. The average income has dropped by more than a third, and taxes have rocketed. Clinical depression is rife, suicides are up, and hundreds of thousands of skilled workers have flitted abroad. After the end of the bailout Monday, Greece will get no new loans and will not be asked for new reforms. But the government has agreed to a timetable of savings so strict as to plague a future generation and a half: For every year over the next four decades, governments must make more than they spend while ensuring that the economy — that shrank by a quarter since 2009 — also expands at a smart rate. \\"Personally, I can see no hope for me in the coming years,\\" says Paraskevi Kolliabi, 62, who lives on a widow's pension and helps out in her son's central Athens silver workshop. \\"Everything looks black to me.\\" Pensioners face pre-agreed new income cuts next year, while a further expansion of the tax base is due in 2020. But tax collection remains scrappy in a country where compliance was never strong, and the taxman's increasingly extravagant demands, coupled with often slapdash policing, only strengthened the sense of injustice. \\"My pension has been cut about thirty percent since the start of the crisis,\\" Kolliabi said. \\"I have never in my life gone through such (financial) hardship as during the past two years. There were entire days when not a single customer would enter\\" the shop in the Monastiraki district. Greece's once cheerfully spendthrift middle class, whose rapid growth before the state finances imploded drove a consumption-fuelled economy, has been squeezed hard by intense taxation, mortgages from the bygone days of easy credit, and job losses. \\"What I see is that the rich are becoming richer and the poor poorer,\\" Kolliabi said. \\"We used to cater to the middle class, and the middle class is dead, they can't make ends meet.\\" Following one of the latest rounds of cutbacks, her son, Panagiotis, now sees more than 60 percent of his income gobbled up by taxes, pension and social security contributions. That kills any ambition for growing the business. \\"The prospects for after Aug. 20 are not good,\\" he said. \\"There's no way I will be able to make an investment ... to expand my business.\\" In the northern city of Thessaloniki, Christos Marmarinos, 55, had to close his clothes manufacturing unit after 25 years in business due to lack of customers. Instead, he plunged what funds he had into something altogether different, a cafeteria and grocery store. \\"We found this way out, and employ ten people,\\" he said. But Greece needs more than cafeterias if the economy is to pick up again and modernize, he says. \\"We need real investments in manufacturing.\\" Part of the sufferings of Greece's private sector are due to disastrous government attempts in the panicky first months of the crisis to shield from cutbacks the bloated public sector, which has traditionally been the political fiefdom and key source of votes for any ruling party. But while considerably smaller and poorer than before the crisis, the public sector remains largely ineffective and disgruntled, providing ever shoddier services. The one area of the economy that's undoubtedly flourishing is tourism, contributing some 20 percent of GDP, with officials projecting a record-high 32 million arrivals this year. Greeks, however, are finding it increasingly expensive to go on holiday in their own country, while a boom in short-term rentals in residential districts of Athens has driven rents beyond the reach of many locals. Even the governing coalition, which swept to power in 2015 promising to instantly end austerity and cancel Greece's debt — only to reverse course and sign a new tough bailout program — is low-key about the end of the bailout era. \\"We're not planning any parties,\\" said Costas Zahariadis, an official in the dominant leftwing Syriza party. \\"We don't believe we should start celebrating as if a large section of Greek society didn't have serious financial problems. But of course we won't be shedding tears over Greece leaving the bailout era.\\" Financial analyst Manos Chatzidakis, who is head of research at Beta Securities, says much has been done over the past eight years, although the tax and judiciary systems need further work. He said that if future governments stick to agreed reforms and fiscal policy then gradually returning confidence will allow Greece to sell its bonds at affordable rates — even if investors initially demand high returns — and attract investment. The ability to tap bond markets is vital, because after the bailout program, Greece will have to finance itself, albeit initially assisted by a substantial cash buffer. \\"I think it's all a question of commitment to the bailout program, to the privatizations, to everything that has been agreed\\" with Greece's creditors, he said. \\"I'm definitely more optimistic than in the past. Things had reached a point (in 2015) where they couldn't get worse.\\" Hatzidakis stressed that many of the bailout reforms were \\"unprecedented\\" for Greece, which took a long time to understand and implement them. \\"So we should not be strict and expect everything to happen fast,\\" he said. \\"It took time to reach this point and a lot of effort, which I think is starting to bear fruit.\\" ___ Srdjan Nedeljkovic in Athens and Costas Kantouris in Thessaloniki contributed to this report. ||||| ‘The worst is over’ after eight very difficult years for the country, commissioner says Greece has turned the page to become “a normal” member of the single currency, European Union authorities in Brussels declared as the country finally exited its eight-year bailout programme. Its three bailouts during the eurozone crisis totalled €288.7bn (£258bn) – the world’s biggest-ever financial rescue. During that time, as the crisis threatened to lead to the nation’s ejection from the single currency – “Grexit” – Greece has had four governments and endured one of the worst recessions in economic history. Greece's bailout is finally at an end – but has been a failure | Larry Elliott Read more Marking the official end of the third bailout programme on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greece was beginning a new chapter after eight “very difficult” years. “We have had eight very difficult years, often very painful years, where we have had three successive programmes. But now Greece can finally turn the page in a crisis that has lasted too long,” he told journalists. “The worst is over.” Evoking pensioners, workers and families who had suffered their own personal crisis, he added that he was “conscious that all those people may not feel that their situation has yet improved much if at all. My message to them is therefore simple: Europe will continue to work with you and for you.” Moscovici said the end of the bailout “draws a symbolic line under an existential crisis” for all 19 countries that share the single currency. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, tweeted: “You did it! Congratulations Greece and its people on ending the programme of financial assistance. With huge efforts and European solidarity you seized the day.” Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) You did it! Congratulations to Greece and its people on ending the programme of financial assistance. With huge efforts and European solidarity you seized the day. Greece was granted €86bn in 2015 in its third bailout but only needed €61.9bn. Total rescue funds stand at €288.7bn, the largest amount ever dispersed by international creditors. “It took much longer than expected but I believe we are there,” said Mário Centeno, the chair of the European Stability Mechanism – the EU bailout fund created as a result of the financial crisis. “Greece’s economy is growing again, there is a budget and trade surplus, and unemployment is falling steadily.” EU officials say Greece is now “a normal country” because it no longer has a bailout programme with conditions imposed by international creditors. However Athens will face more exacting checks than any other eurozone member, so Brussels can monitor whether the government’s budgets are in line with EU stability and growth targets. Moscovici insisted this “enhanced post-programme surveillance” would be “much lighter” than anything imposed by the troika, the name for the three creditor institutions, which became a byword for Greece’s loss of sovereignty during the economic crisis. However, away from the official optimism in Brussels and Luxembourg, huge questions remain about how a country scarred by austerity can recover. Almost a fifth of Greece’s working-age population is out of work. By 2023 unemployment is forecast to fall to 14%, far higher than the current eurozone average 0f 8.3%. Meanwhile, youth unemployment remains at 43.6% – the worst in the EU. Many analysts believe it will take a decade before Greece returns to pre-crisis living standards following a slump in which its economy contracted by 25% and unemployment peaked at 28%. After wages and pensions were slashed in the first bailout, economic output dropped, small businesses folded, suicide rates increased and levels of extreme poverty jumped. The population has fallen by 3% because of emigration and a lower birth rate. Greece has the highest government debt in the EU, 177% of gross domestic product, and is forecast to be repaying loans until 2060. The country’s former creditors remain divided about the way forward. As a condition of getting debt relief, Athens agreed to the EU’s demand to run a budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and thereafter 2%. However, the International Monetary Fund, a co-funder of the bailouts, has long argued this goal is too onerous for a country that has endured years of belt-tightening. The IMF lost the argument but revealed its scepticism its latest country report on Greece. The fund said achieving a surplus of 3.5% of GDP would require high taxation and constrained social spending. It called on Athens to stay in line with creditor-mandated spending plans and reduce high tax rateswhile broadening the income tax base. “Any delay in these reforms would seriously undermine the credibility of the assumptions underlying the debt relief measures agreed with European partners,” the IMF said. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Allied to doubts about Greece’s budget targets, the fund fears the EU’s assumptions about Greek economic growth are too optimistic. “Very ambitious assumptions” about GDP growth and Greece’s ability to run large primary fiscal surpluses raise questions about the sustainability of debt over the long-run, suggesting “further debt relief” could be needed, it has said. Angelos Chryssogelos, who teaches Greek politics at King’s College London, said weak growth is one of the biggest dangers. “Greece is in a position of purgatory,” he said. “It is going to be going to be in a high taxation, low growth cycle for the forseeable future. Greece needed far-reaching reforms, he said, such as improving the functioning of the state, more digitalisation and making life easier for business startups. “You need really far-reaching structural reforms for growth to be kick-started, but that is something most Greek governments are unable to deliver.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Moscovici: 'An exceptionally tough period for the Greek people' Greece has successfully completed a three-year eurozone emergency loan programme worth €61.9bn (£55bn; 70.8bn) to tackle its debt crisis. It was part of the biggest bailout in global financial history, totalling some €289bn, which will take the country decades to repay. Deeply unpopular cuts to public spending, a condition of the bailout, are set to continue. But for the first time in eight years, Greece can borrow at market rates. The economy has grown slowly in recent years and is still 25% smaller than when the crisis began. \\"From today, Greece will be treated like any other Europe area country,\\" the EU's Commissioner on Economic and Financial Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said on Monday. Its reforms had, he said, \\"laid the foundation for a sustainable recovery\\" but he also cautioned that its recovery was \\"not an event, it is a process\\". According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), only four countries have shrunk economically more than Greece in the past decade: Yemen, Libya, Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea. Read more on this story: How was Greece bailed out? The last €61.9bn was provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in support of the Greek government's efforts to reform the economy and recapitalise banks. The bailout - the term given to emergency loans aimed at saving the sinking Greek economy - began in 2010, when eurozone states and the IMF came together to provide a first tranche of €20bn. The European single currency had fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2006 and there were fears the debt crisis in Greece would undermine Europe's recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Former Prime Minister George Papandreou saw his government crumble after agreeing to the bailout At the worst moments of the crisis, there were doubts about whether the eurozone would survive at all. There seemed to be a real possibility that Greece and perhaps others might have to give up the euro. The response included bailout loans, for a total of five countries, and a promise from the European Central Bank that it would, if necessary, buy the government debts of countries in danger of being forced out of the eurozone. Set up by eurozone states, the ESM had been prepared to provide a further 27bn to Greece but said the country had not needed to call on it. \\"Greece can stand on its own feet,\\" said ESM chairman Mario Centeno.

This proud nation has struggled to accept its loss of dignity. \\"I don't see the crisis coming to an end,\\" she says. \\"We are stressed and angry because we don't have jobs. I'm embarrassed that I can't buy my little grandchildren a present.

Today he gets €685 and his debts are growing, he told Reuters news agency. He can no longer support the families of his two sons and can barely cover his and his wife's needs. \\"I wake up in the morning to a nightmare,\\" he said. \\"How will I manage my finances and my responsibilities? This is what I wake up to every morning.\\" How will the loans be repaid? While Greece's economy has stabilised, its accumulated debt pile stands at about 180% of GDP. Under a deal hammered out with other eurozone states in June, it must keep strict control over its public spending, running a budget surplus, before interest payments, of at least 2.2% of GDP until the year 2060. With serious questions over its ability to manage, some analysts predict it will still be paying off its current debt after 2060. Greece's freedom to control its own economic affairs will be tempered by enhanced surveillance from the European Union's executive, the European Commission. Professor Costas Meghir, an economist with Yale University based in the Greek capital Athens, told the BBC: \\"The Greek government has to be even more disciplined now because it has to rely on foreign markets at reasonable interest rates to be able to borrow.\\" What does the Greek milestone mean for Europe? Professor Kevin Featherstone, director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said Greece had helped to safeguard the future of the eurozone by agreeing to the terms of the bailout programme. \\"For a political system to have gone through these years of austerity, this depth of economic hardship, and maintained a functioning society, a functioning democracy, is testament to the robustness of Greece as a modern state,\\" he said. \\"Greece has saved the euro.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Greece has formally exited its third and final bailout programme after receiving €61.9bn (70.8bn) in emergency loans for its debt crisis.

He loved a girl who lived in Louisiana. He decided he needed to move. He moved to be with his love.","completion":"As soon as he had made up his mind, the man from Kentucky began planning his move to Louisiana. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but the thought of being closer to the girl he loved filled him with determination and excitement. Step 1: Make a Moving Plan His first move was to create a well-structured plan outlining everything he needed to do before, during, and after the move. He included tasks like sorting out his belongings, packing, researching moving companies, and setting a moving date. This plan helped him stay organized and focused throughout the entire process. Step 2: Sort and Decide What to Bring Next, he went through all his possessions to determine what was worth taking with him and what could be donated or sold. He knew that moving to a new city would be a fresh start, and he wanted to travel light. By doing this, he also saved money as the cost of moving depends on how much belongings he needed to transport. Step 3: Set a Moving Date After consulting with the girl in Louisiana and considering his work schedule, he decided on a moving date. Setting a deadline helped him to stay on track, and he was able to coordinate logistics with friends, family, and the moving company. Step 4: Find a Moving Company He searched for reputable moving companies in his area, read reviews and compared prices before finally deciding on a company he could trust with his belongings. He booked their services for his moving date and coordinated with them to ensure a smooth process. Step 5: Notify Important Parties Before the move, the man made sure to inform his employer, utility companies, and the post office about his change of address. He also made a list of all his friends, family, and other acquaintances who needed to be informed about his move. Step 6: Begin Packing With only a few weeks left until the big move, he began packing up his belongings. He separated items by room, carefully wrapped fragile items, and labeled boxes to make the unpacking process easier in his new home. He made sure to pack what he would need first, last, so they would be easily accessible upon arrival. Step 7: Moving Day On the day of the move, he woke up early to ensure everything was in order. He had prepared an essentials box with items like toiletries, clean clothes, and important documents to have on hand during the journey. He met with the moving company, double-checked his belongings, and embarked on his trip to Louisiana. Step 8: Settling In and Reconnecting with His Love Once in Louisiana, the man started to settle into his new home. Unpacking took some time, but he carefully arranged his belongings and began to create a comfortable living space. He updated his address with all necessary parties, found a new job, and explored his new surroundings in hopes of quickly adjusting to his new life. Most importantly, he reconnected with the girl he loved. They spent time together, getting to know each other even better, and shared their experiences and aspirations. Their relationship grew stronger day by day, and they both knew that the man's decision to move was the right one.

Answer:","completion":"Whole grain oats refer to oats that have undergone minimal processing and still retain all three components of the grain, which are the bran, germ, and endosperm. They are a highly nutritious food and are considered a staple in many diets around the world. Whole grain oats contain several key elements and nutrients that make them a healthy choice. Some of these elements include: 1. Carbohydrates: Whole grain oats are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, which provide energy and help maintain steady blood sugar levels. They contain both soluble and insoluble fiber, which aid in digestion and improve gut health. 2. Protein: Oats are a good source of plant-based protein, with approximately 17% protein content in their composition. They contain essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source. 3. Fats: Although oats have a low-fat content (around 7%), they contain a large proportion of healthy unsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart health and overall wellbeing. 4. Vitamins: Whole grain oats are rich in essential vitamins, including B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B9), which are necessary for energy production, metabolism regulation, and maintaining a healthy nervous system. They also contain vitamin E, an antioxidant that supports immune function and protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. 5. Minerals: Oats are a good source of essential minerals like manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, and iron. These minerals play important roles in bone health, enzyme function, and overall metabolic health. 6. Phytonutrients: Whole grain oats contain several phytonutrients, such as avenanthramides and beta-glucans, which have been associated with various health benefits like reducing inflammation, improving heart health, and supporting immune function. Now, you mentioned \\"Triticale flour\\" - triticale is actually a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye(Secale), and it is a different cereal grain from whole grain oats. Triticale flour is made from ground triticale grains. Although triticale flour shares some nutritional similarities with whole grain oats, such as containing carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, vitamins, and minerals, they are still distinct grains with their unique characteristics and nutrient profiles. In summary, triticale flour is not a direct substitute for whole grain oats in terms of the nutrient composition and health benefits attributed to oats. While both grains are nutritious, they have different characteristics, which may change the taste, texture, and nutritional profile of the final product when used in recipes. Thus, it is important to consider the unique properties of each grain when deciding which to use in a particular application."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Franken's speech was defined primarily by his lack of any real apology and the clear bitterness he carries for being pushed out amid allegations that he had groped several women and forcibly tried to kiss others. Here's the key bit from Franken (bolding is mine): \\"Over the last few weeks, a number of women have come forward to talk about how they felt my actions had affected them. I was shocked. I was upset. But in responding to their claim, I also wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation. Because all women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously. I think that was the right thing to do. I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that in fact I haven't done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.\\" That's a remarkable statement. Franken is simultaneously saying that he believes the women who have accused him have a right to be heard while also making very clear that he is not admitting he had done the things they alleged. He went on to note that \\"I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator, nothing has brought dishonor on this institution,\\" adding: \\"I am confident that the ethics committee would agree.\\" And, just in case there was any question that Franken believed he was being unfairly railroaded, the senator's turn to Donald Trump and Roy Moore cleared all that up. Said Franken: \\"I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party. But this decision is not about me. It's about the people of Minnesota.\\" The message of all this is clear as day: I didn't do anything really wrong. The people who say I did are wrong or don't remember it right. And it's ridiculous that people like Trump and Moore are in the White House and might be in the Senate, respectively, while I am being forced out. Franken got support in that view from an unlikely source on Thursday: Former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. \\"Franken should not have resigned. His fate should have been left 2 the people of MN. Moore, who had sexual contact w a 14-yr old, should drop out. Conyers, who hit on his employees, should have resigned. Franken is a creep who acted inappropriatly, but his facts are different,\\" tweeted Fleischer shortly after Franken's resignation announcement. The second part of Franken's conclusion will have a lot of Democratic heads nodding. Why is Franken resigning for allegations of groping and unwanted kissing while Trump is in office after more than a dozen women accused him during the campaign of sexual harassment? Why is Franken resigning when Roy Moore, who faces multiple allegations of pursuing relationships with teenagers as young as 14 when he was in his 30s, is looking more and more like a winner in next Tuesday's special election? Those are fair questions. The simple reason is because Franken gave in to the pressure to step aside while Trump and Moore just kept saying they didn't do anything wrong and had no plans to leave their respective races. And the political willpower didn't exist in Alabama or the country to get rid of them. But the first part of Franken's contention -- that he did not do anything wrong and these women were either mistaken or misremembering -- will sit less well even with his most ardent supporters. If Franken truly believes -- as he said -- that he did nothing wrong here, then why is he resigning? His explanation was that he couldn't simultaneously deal with an ethics investigation and represent the state effectively. But he was the one who called for an ethics investigation when he announced last week that he was planning to stay on the job and work to win back the trust of his colleagues and his constituents! What changed between then and now? The answer is that almost three dozen of Franken's colleagues called for him to step down over the last 24 hours -- including a united front of Democratic female senators . There was just no way that Franken could realistically stay on amid that depth of condemnation. (Although, per Trump and Moore, maybe he could have.) Franken bowed to what he believed to be the inevitable political reality facing him. But in so doing, he wanted to make sure everyone -- in the chamber and outside of it -- didn't see his resignation as an admission of guilt. Because Franken just doesn't think he's guilty. ||||| CNN's Jake Tapper made a valiant effort to extract clarity from President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in an interview on State of the Union Sunday.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Coal is harvested from a coal mine - The coal is transported either by train or truck to power station - The coal is burned in a furnace - Water is turned into steam in the boiler - The steam is cooled in cooling towers - The steam turns the turbines - The generator makes electricity - The electricity is sent through transformers. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people are worried about pollution happens, how will it affect more people switch to electric fires. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process you've described. Directly, if more people are indeed worried about pollution and subsequently switch to electric fires, there would be less demand for coal for heating purposes. This could perhaps lead to a decrease in the amount of coal harvested from mines, which would consequently lead to less coal being transported to power stations, thus reducing the overall process of coal electricity generation. Indirectly, the switch to electric fires could increase the demand for electricity. If this additional electricity need is met with traditional coal burning, the usage and therefore harvesting, transport, and burning of coal at power stations could actually increase, leading to a growth in the whole process involved in coal electricity generation. However, this perturbation could also provide an impetus to invest more in renewable energy sources to meet the increased demand for electricity while avoiding the pollution from coal burning. So, the exact outcome may depend on various factors, including how the shift to electrical fires is managed; whether it’s offset by a decrease in coal-burning for heating; and how the increased demand for electricity is met, potentially affecting policies and decisions made in the energy sector. Therefore, the proposed perturbation could lead towards a cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy infrastructure, but this largely depends on investment in renewable energy sources and environmentally-conscious policy decisions. It's also important to note that electric fires are just one component of a broader move towards electrification, which also involves things like electric cars, heating systems, industrial processes, among others. All of these factors could collectively have a significant impact on our energy systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write an article based on this \\"Iran is ready to show more transparency on its nuclear programme, says President-elect Hassan Rouhani.\\"","completion":"Title: Iran's President-elect Hassan Rouhani Emphasizes Increased Nuclear Transparency Subtitle: A closer look into Iran's intentions to enhance the transparency of its nuclear programme as announced by President-elect Hassan Rouhani. Introduction Iran's President-elect, Hassan Rouhani, announced his intention to showcase more transparency in regard to Iran's nuclear programme. The decision reflects the nation's willingness to collaborate with the global community and address long-standing concerns regarding its nuclear intentions. Step 1: Mention the historical context of Iran's nuclear programme Iran's nuclear programme has been in the spotlight for decades, with the international community concerned about its possible intention to develop nuclear weapons. The nation has faced numerous sanctions due to these fears. However, Iran has always maintained that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. Step 2: Explain the importance of transparency in addressing concerns By committing to increased transparency, Iran aims to build trust with the international community, demonstrating that its nuclear programme poses no threat. This step is expected to alleviate concerns and facilitate dialogue with other nations. Step 3: Illuminate the benefits for Iran and the international community Increased transparency in Iran's nuclear programme can lead to the gradual easing of sanctions, which have severely impacted the nation's economy. This will not only benefit Iran but could potentially improve relations with other countries. The international community can then focus on peaceful collaboration and addressing pressing global issues such as climate change and terrorism. Step 4: Explore possible challenges in implementing increased transparency Despite Iran's stated commitment to increased transparency, practical implementation might face obstacles. Issues such as the potential breaching of national security, concerns about revealing sensitive information, and resistance from hardliners within the country may pose challenges. However, these obstacles can be overcome through mutual trust, dialogue, and robust verification processes implemented by international organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Step 5: Discuss the potential role of the United States Given the historical animosity between Iran and the United States, the role of the latter cannot be ignored. The Biden administration has expressed its willingness to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which could help Iran's transparency efforts, enhance communication, and promote diplomatic relations between the two countries. Step 6: Conclusion In conclusion, President-elect Hassan Rouhani's declaration to enhance transparency in Iran's nuclear programme is a crucial step in addressing global concerns and building trust. Striving for more openness can benefit both Iran and the international community, providing a foundation for collaboration and the resolution of long-standing issues. While challenges may arise, continued dialogue and a commitment to working together can lead to a brighter future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Statistically, you are more likely to hit a ship if you aim for the center of the board, so start there. The four by four squares in the middle of the board are likely to contain a carrier ship or battleship. Imagine the board as a checkerboard, where half the squares are dark and half are light. Each ship covers at least two squares, meaning every ship must touch a dark square. Therefore, if you fire randomly at only even squares or only odd squares, you will minimize the number of turns you need to hit every ship. Once you have a hit, you will cease firing randomly and commence targeting the ship in question. To keep track of the light and dark squares, look at your own board and imagine that the diagonal line of squares from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is dark. Imagine the squares from the to right corner to the bottom left corner are light. You can count out from there to ensure each square you're targeting is the right color. If you strike out twice when firing, try firing into a different segment of the board. The chances that you just missed a ship are lower than the chances that you missed by a wide margin.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? - because the labor was too long - not enough information - because they were in a small town - because they were born 2 months early The answer is:","completion":"The babies had to go to the NICU because they were born 2 months early. Being born prematurely, the twins required specialized medical care and monitoring to address the various health issues common in premature infants, such as breathing difficulties, underdeveloped organs, and problems with waste elimination.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Shen Kuo (Chinese: Chen Gua ; 1031-1095), courtesy name Cunzhong (Cun Zhong ) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given as Mengxi) Weng (Meng Xi Weng ), was a Han Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman of the Song dynasty (960-1279). Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, encyclopedist, general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, poet, and musician. Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (Chen Zhou ; 978-1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (Xu ). Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (Pi ) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (Xu Dong ; 975-1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat. From about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics. Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km2) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals. Is there anything else important about his youth?","completion":"Yes, there are several other important aspects of Shen Kuo's youth that contributed to his development as a polymath and influential figure in the Song dynasty. As mentioned in the article, Shen Kuo received his initial education from his mother, who was also very educated and taught him and his brother military doctrines. This early exposure to diverse knowledge and teachings played a crucial role in shaping his intellectual interests and pursuits. Moreover, during his youth, Shen Kuo's family frequently moved and explored various regions in China, exposing him to the diverse topography, cultures, and communities across the country. This helped deepen his understanding and curiosity about the natural world, as well as his interest in administrative governance due to his father's involvement in it. Another significant aspect of Shen Kuo's youth was his poor health, which led to his curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics. This interest would later contribute to his knowledge and expertise in various scientific fields. Lastly, even during his early years, Shen Kuo showcased an innate ability to plan, organize, and design. For example, he was responsible for designing and supervising the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system that turned a considerable area of swampland into prime farmland. This experience highlights his early proficiency in practical applications of various fields of knowledge, including engineering and agriculture. Overall, Shen Kuo's youth is marked by a multitude of experiences and early education that contributed to his development as a polymath, influential scientist, and statesman of the Song dynasty. His diverse interests and skills, combined with his determination and natural abilities, enabled him to excel in a wide range of fields and leave a lasting impact on history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

After losing the previous week to Jacksonville, the Indianapolis Colts came back home to Lucas Oil Stadium to battle with an undefeated Kansas City Chiefs team. The Chiefs' head coach, Todd Haley opened up the ballgame with an onside kick intended to give Kansas City the ball first. However, after it bounced less than 10&#160;yards, the Colts received possession deep in Kansas City territory. Indianapolis was unable to capitalize on the good field position and forced Adam Vinatieri to kick a 20-yard field goal. Throughout the first quarter neither teams' offenses were able to get into a rhythm and by the end of the first quarter the Colts held a slim lead by the score of 3-0. With the start of the second quarter the offensive woes continued. The Colts were again unable to score a touchdown on good field position and were forced to kick their second field goal of the day. After a failed running play of fourth down by the Colts, the Chiefs were able to move down the field on good passes by Matt Cassel and a penalty on the Colts and were able to kick a field goal. Going into halftime, the score was 6-3 Colts. The third quarter continued to prove to be a defensive struggle. The Colts kicked another field goal midway through, however the Chiefs drove down the field to score another field goal. A Peyton Manning interception set up another field goal by the Chiefs which tied the game at 9-9. At the beginning of the fourth quarter the Colts continued their scoring ways of the day with a fourth field goal from Vinatieri. Finally with four minutes left in the ballgame, Mike Hart broke open an 11-yard run for the only touchdown of the day by both teams. The Colts won the game 19-9 and improved to 3-2 on the season.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ousted after the Arab Spring, a former dictator is back SANAA, Yemen — The slim, brown-suited man with the handlebar mustache nodded approvingly. He stood behind a chair at a ceremony in the summer, watching as his loyalists and rebels signed a power-sharing deal to rule the country. Never mind that peace talks were underway at the time, or that the United Nations had expressed concerns that the deal violated the constitution. Yemen’s former longtime ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was back. Ousted during the Arab Spring uprisings, one of the Middle East’s wiliest politicians has risen up again. He is taking advantage of the chaos of conflict and the political inexperience of the rebels to deepen his influence, officials and analysts say. Saleh was once a vital counterterrorism ally of the United States and Saudi Arabia, but they abandoned him in favor of the youthful revolutionaries who launched the mass protests that toppled him in 2012. Today, he is one of the biggest obstacles to U.S. efforts to broker peace in Yemen and threatens Washington’s influence in the Middle East. American efforts to contain Yemen’s al-Qaeda branch, viewed by U.S. officials as the terror group’s most menacing affiliate, have dramatically been scaled back. Saleh also stands in the way of Saudi Arabia, whose military is deeply involved in a campaign against the rebels. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen’s war after the rebels ousted the government last year. The rebels are widely thought to be backed by Iran, Saudi Arabia’s rival in the region. The war has cost the Saudis billions of dollars at a time of shrinking oil revenue, and has yielded few political results so far. [Life and death in Yemen’s hospitals] Saleh is accustomed to confusion, crisis and fear. Some analysts say he thrives under such conditions. For 33 years, he ruled with an iron fist over a country beset by rampant corruption and security threats, from a northern rebellion to a southern secessionist movement. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Saleh entered into a wary relationship with the United States. In exchange for economic and military aid, he allowed the U.S. military and CIA to strike at al-Qaeda’s branch, known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. These days, portraits of Saleh remain visible across a capital battered by war, and he’s referred to as the “Godfather” in some circles. He regularly appears on his party’s TV channel, holding meetings and giving speeches. “Saleh is trying to see himself as the kingmaker,” said Jamie McGoldrick, the top U.N. humanitarian official in Yemen. “He’s re-emerged as a force, whether you like him or not.” A State Department official said Saleh “retains considerable influence in the country” and could “play a constructive role in bringing the conflict to an end, if he so chooses.” A military spokesman for the coalition, as well as officials from Yemen’s internationally recognized government, did not respond to requests for comment. Citing security concerns, Saleh’s office declined requests for an interview, but his advisers say he has no aspirations to rule again. Analysts say he might be trying to put his eldest son, Ahmed Ali, in position to take the country’s helm one day. At the very least, Saleh’s actions suggest that he wants to remain a central political figure in the region, protecting his family, his legacy and billions of dollars amassed over his rule, according to U.N. investigators. “He’s a survivor,” said Hisham Sharaf, a former minister in Saleh’s regime. Of all the autocrats toppled in the Arab revolts, Saleh is the only one whose fate has not yet been resolved. Tunisia’s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled into exile. Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak is being detained in a military hospital. Libya’s Moammar Gaddafi was brutally killed. [A Libyan arms dealer chased by Gaddafi’s legacy] Saleh, 74, has also outlasted the opponents who removed him from office: the protest movement leaders, a powerful army general who turned against him, a rival tribal family and the country’s most powerful Islamist party. All have been diminished. Saleh’s shrewdest move, perhaps, was his ability to stay in the country despite U.S. and international efforts to force him into exile after he handed power to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in February 2012. With his political party intact, and his loyalists in the new government, Saleh meddled behind the scenes, his critics say. Hadi gradually chipped away at Saleh’s power, removing his family members from key military and security posts. But as northern rebels gained more territory, Saleh soon saw an opportunity. When the rebels, known as the Houthis, seized the capital last year, Hadi fled to the southern city of Aden. Since March, 2015 the Saudi-led coalition has tried to bring him back to power. The United States is aiding the coalition with weapons, intelligence and other support to bolster Saudi Arabia, its valued ally, as well as regain its ability to counter al-Qaeda. The conflict has worsened a humanitarian crisis and left thousands of civilians dead. The power vacuum has allowed al-Qaeda and a nascent Islamic State affiliate to expand and stage numerous attacks, while political, regional and tribal divisions widen. During his rule, Saleh, a secularist, fought six civil wars against the deeply religious-minded northern Houthi rebels, who have long viewed his regime as corrupt and blamed it for most of the country’s problems. But Saleh made an unlikely alliance with the Houthis to survive. “It was a marriage of convenience,” said Nabil Al-Soufi, a political analyst who is close to the General People’s Congress, the party Saleh still leads. [A cluster bomb made in America shattered lives in Yemen’s capital] Today, well-trained and equipped Yemeni soldiers loyal to Saleh work with Houthi fighters on the front lines. With cash and charisma, he has gotten powerful tribes and political allies to accept the Houthis’ rule. In their self-proclaimed government, known as the Supreme Political Council, Saleh’s loyalists and the Houthis jointly run ministries and other parts of a bureaucracy. They control northwest Yemen, while Hadi and forces nominally loyal to him oversee portions of the south and east. Saleh meets regularly with Houthi leaders, securing the influence of his party through his political skills, and deftly uses social media. “We benefit a lot from his presence,” said Faiqah al-Sayed, a top official in Saleh’s party. “Perhaps, it is the wisdom of God that he’s still here with us.” Saleh has declared on television that his alliance has enough weapons to wage war for another decade, if the peace talks don’t go its way. He has remained defiant, even under U.N. sanctions imposed on him, rallying hundreds of thousands of supporters in street protests. “He’s now in the strongest position since he left office,” said Riyadh al-Ahmedi, a Yemeni political analyst. But tensions between Saleh and the Houthis appear to be growing. They have clashed over the governing of ministries, while Houthi officials have expressed displeasure at some of Saleh’s public statements, analysts and Western officials say. “Their goals and ambitions appear to be in conflict with each other,” said the State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as per diplomatic protocol. Saleh’s aides and Houthi officials deny there is any friction, saying such reports were instigated by the Saudi-led coalition. “It’s natural for us to disagree,” said Abdulmalik Al-Ajri, a senior Houthi political official. “But there’s no conflict between us and the GPC.” Saleh, whose houses have been struck by coalition airstrikes, never sleeps in the same location for more than a night straight, his aides say. Yemen, they warn, could become even more chaotic without its godfather. “If you kill Ali Abdullah Saleh,” Sharaf said, “you’ll have a thousand Ali Abdullah Salehs looking at you as an enemy.” Yemen suffers its own cruel losses, far from Aleppo In Yemeni capital, signs of hatred toward Americans are everywhere Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","completion":"Yemen’s former ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is returning to centre stage, taking advantage of the chaos of ongoing conflict within the country and the political inexperience of the rebel Houthi movement he once fought against. This follows power-sharing deals signed by the Houthis and loyalists of the former dictator during the summer. Saleh’s ascendancy is now seen as a major threat to US and Saudi Arabian efforts to broker peace in the country. In addition, the power vaccum in the country has allowed al-Qaeda and ISIS to expand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, after using the app for a while, I must say that I am disappointed. I'm giving it a 2-star rating due to its limited features and inconsistent performance, but I must acknowledge some positive aspects. Here's a detailed review of my experience: 1. User Interface & Design: The user interface, though visually appealing, lacks intuitiveness, which made it difficult for me to navigate through the app. A steep learning curve might be tolerable for an app offering unique and unmatched features, but for org.sagemath.droid, it just adds to the frustration. Moreover, I found a lack of consistency in terms of design elements, and the placement of buttons and menus was often confusing. 2. Features & Functionality: For an app promising powerful mathematical tools, it falls short in delivering the practicality I was looking for. The app seems limited to basic algebra and lacks advanced features such as integration and differentiation that II would expect from a math app dedicated to a diverse audience. Furthermore, the inability to save and export results or equations hinders the app's practicality for those who regularly rely on such tools for school, work or research. 3. Performance & Stability: The performance of org.sagemath.droid has also been a disappointment. The app frequently hangs, and calculations take much longer than anticipated, severely disrupting workflows and affecting productivity. Additionally, I've encountered multiple crashes, which resulted in loss of information and frustration. 4. Customer Support & Updates: While the app listing touts a responsive and supportive development team, I didn't experience the level of customer support I expected when reaching out for assistance. My queries remained unanswered or received generic responses. 5. Positives: Despite the numerous issues, there were some positives. The app's visual appeal is undeniable, and when it does work, the calculations are accurate. Additionally, the range of user-customizable settings and graphing options provide a certain level of flexibility. This app does show potential, and I hope the developers address these issues in the future. In conclusion, org.sagemath.droid has left me disappointed with its limited features, inconsistent performance, and steep learning curve. As it stands, I cannot fully recommend this app for anyone seeking advanced and efficient mathematical tools. I sincerely hope the developers rectify these shortcomings in future updates and transform org.sagemath.droid into the powerful and practical math app it has the potential to become. Until then, I would advise potential users to consider alternative apps for their mathematical needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test needs to talk with the teacher and his or her parents so they can find some solutions together. Talking about these problems and working them out will be better than cheating. Question: The author thinks that when kids cheat in class, _ .

Cheating provides an unfair advantage, making difficult things seem easy without actually putting in the effort to learn and understand the material. This can lead to a loss of respect for cheaters and diminish their sense of accomplishment. The author also emphasizes that even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, it is still not a good idea, and cheating is an unacceptable and unfair behavior. Instead, addressing the problem directly with teachers and parents is recommended for finding long-term and effective solutions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

How is the load on an engine controls the governor speed? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions inquire about the same information but are formatted slightly differently. In a mechanical system, the load on the engine significantly controls the speed of the governor. Here are the steps detailing how this functions: 1. Initial Step: The governor is a device in the engine mechanism designed to maintain the engine speed constant irrespective of the load. It achieves this by varying the amount of fuel supplied to the engine. 2. Load Decreases: If the load on the engine decreases, the engine tends to speed up. 3. Response of the Governor: The governor detects this increase in speed. In response to the overspeeding, the governor reduces the amount of fuel supplied to the engine. This reduction of fuel slows down the engine operation back to the desired speed. 4. Load Increases: Conversely, if the load on the engine increases, the engine tends to slow down. 5. Response of the Governor: The governor detects the drop in speed due to the added load. To counteract the slowing down, the governor increases the amount of fuel supplied to the engine. This increased fuel supply motivates the engine to maintain the desired speed. Throughout the entire process, the primary role of the governor is to balance the engine speed depending on the load. It accomplishes this by dynamically adjusting the fuel supply to the engine. The accurate functioning of the governor ensures the longevity and efficiency of the engine, as well as ensures the reliability of the machine or vehicle to which the engine is attached."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rural villages held mass burials in northern Nigeria on Sunday, the Red Cross said, raising the possibility that six days of post-election violence have produced heavy casualties. There is no official death toll, but witnesses say hundreds have died. The government has provided few other details out of concern the violence could spiral. Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress and longtime civil rights campaigner, told CNN there have been 500 burials. CNN could not independently confirm that number. The Civil Rights Congress, based in Kaduna, has in the past been known to ally itself with pro-northern political groups. The election of President Goodluck Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay subsequent gubernatorial elections in two states. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the elections were rigged. Armed protesters in the region prowled the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition frontrunner. The last election four years ago was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While the Monday elections were marred by violence, reports of underage voting and other logistical problems, observers considered it an improvement. World leaders have urged the west African nation to probe allegations of ballot stuffing and unusually high turnout in some areas. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned perpetrators that persistent postelection violence could threaten the stability of the country. \\"These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war,\\" Jonathan said last week. Jonathan was referring to a period of unrest in the 1960s that spawned a civil war in Nigeria. Muslims fearing reprisal attacks in Christian areas have fled to military barracks or neighboring states, the Nigerian Red Cross said. More than 40,000 people are displaced in the north, according to the aid group. Government officials have declined to release the number of fatalities or injuries over fears it could prompt revenge attacks. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation with 150 million people. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"- Mass burials took place in northern Nigeria due to post-election violence. - No official death toll, but witnesses say hundreds have died. - Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, reported 500 burials, but this could not be independently confirmed. - Violence was sparked by the election of President Goodluck Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian south, in the Muslim-dominated north. - Nigerian election officials delayed subsequent gubernatorial elections in two states. - World leaders have urged Nigeria to investigate allegations of ballot stuffing and unusually high turnout in some areas. - Persistent post-election violence could threaten the stability of the country, according to President Jonathan. - More than 40,000 people are displaced in the north, as reported by the Nigerian Red Cross."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It is just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's 'hit man'. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments, electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to Florida to hide at her brother James' house until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters.

When Jack and Amanda got married ten years ago, their friends and families joked that they were joined at the hip. 'We spent every free minute with each other,' Amanda told me. 'We'd go for long walks and cook supper. We loved the cinema, entertaining friends, adventurous holidays - and we had a great sex life.' But by the time Jack, 42, and Amanda, 41, came to see me for marital advice earlier this year, their pleasure in one another was a distant memory. It all changed when their children came along - daughter Emily, now eight, and their son, Tom, six. The couple admitted they had slept together only a handful of times since Tom's birth, had almost stopped talking to each other - and were at breaking point.

Company statement said Wang has been expelled from the communist party.","completion":"Title: Executive Wang Qikang Expelled from Communist Party After Inappropriate Behavior in Public Caught on Camera In a recent shocking incident, Wang Qikang, a 38-year-old executive from Shanghai, China, was caught inappropriately staring at a woman's shorts before making physical contact. The event led to his expulsion from the Communist Party, as well as repercussions at his company, state-run travel agency Shanghai Jinjiang. The compromising footage brought to light the inappropriate actions of Wang Qikang, who hails from Shanghai, China, and which has now played a significant role in the professional and personal life of this once-prominent executive. Tainted by the scandal, Wang has been dismissed from both his role within the Communist Party and his company, causing a ripple effect in the community. Initially, the video captures Qikang taking a close look at a woman's shorts in a public place. Unaware that he was being recorded, he dared to stroke her upper thigh, breaching personal boundaries and appropriate conduct. In the face of this blatant disregard for privacy, the repercussions have been swift and severe. Upon realizing that the woman had turned around, Qikang attempted to avoid confrontation by pretending to look at his phone. This act of feigned nonchalance, however, did little to quell the ensuing uproar. As an executive at Shanghai Jinjiang, which happens to be a state-run travel agency, Wang Qikang's position granted him considerable authority and responsibility. With this role came expectations of professionalism and an impeccable personal record. Unfortunately, the recent scandal has cast doubts on his credibility and integrity, giving the company and the Communist Party ample reason to expel him from their ranks. In an official company statement, it was announced that Wang has been expelled from the Communist Party due to his actions. This sends a clear message that the Communist Party and companies like Shanghai Jinjiang will not condone or tolerate such improper behavior from its members or employees. While Wang's expulsion might seem extreme to some, the act demonstrates the diligence and strict adherence to principles that both the Communist Party and Shanghai Jinjiang hold. The case also serves as a deterrent for others who may risk crossing the boundaries of acceptable social behavior. Moreover, this incident has sparked conversations on maintaining a safe and respectful environment for women in public spaces. It highlights the importance of recognizing and respecting personal boundaries, regardless of one's position or status. In conclusion, Wang Qikang's case is a firm reminder that adherence to strict ethical standards should always be maintained, regardless of one's standing or social role. His actions serve as a cautionary tale for individuals like him, who may think that the privileges that come with being an executive provide immunity from the consequences of wrongful behavior. In the end, the swift decision to expel Qikang from the Communist Party and his position within Shanghai Jinjiang marked a notable stance against such disturbing incidents and reinforced the commitment to maintain morality and professionalism in every sphere of society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adult moths are generally gray with hints of either red or white coloring, and they measure roughly 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long. Larvae are about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long and look like worms with 5 pairs of legs. The easiest way to spot a pantry moth problem is to actually see an adult moth flying around your pantry. This usually happens at night rather than during the day. If you suspect that you may have a pantry moth infestation, check all the dry food in your pantry. Moths hide out in flour, cereal, rice, and other grains most often, but you should also check pet food, dried fruit, or any other dry food products. In short, check everything. Look in the corners and along the inside edges of the cupboards for clumps of stringy or grainy material. Pantry moths leave webbing almost everywhere that they crawl, and it is within the cocoon that they can lay hundreds of eggs. Cocoon webbing is usually found behind where a shelf meets a wall or beneath shelf paper. Small holes appearing in dry food packaging that you haven't created are an easy way to tell if your home has pantry moths. Check all boxes, bags, and plastic wrapping for signs of these pests. The holes won't always appear only once the food is in your home. Food is sometimes sold already contaminated with pantry moths, so check all packaging before you purchase your groceries. Summary:","completion":"This article is about how to find pantry moths in your home by checking dry food, looking for webbing and holes in packages, and seeing them flying around, especially at night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: octopus, fresh fish, skeleton, human body, dog's mouth Why is \\"fresh fish\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"\\"Fresh fish\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons when considering the given scenario: \\"The monger removed the bone, what was he looking to serve?\\" 1. Contextual understanding: A monger can refer to someone who sells items or goods, with the most common form being a fishmonger dealing with seafood. The word \\"bond\\" removal in the context of a monger suggests that the monger is handling food that might contain bones, such as fish. 2. Cultural familiarity: In many cultures, fish is a widely consumed food item. Fresh fish is a preference for many consumers as it promises better quality, taste, and nutrition compared to an older or less fresh fish. People are also more familiar with a monger serving fish than with them serving other possible answers given, such as a human body or dog's mouth. 3. Food safety: Deboning is a common practice when serving fish. It helps prevent choking hazards and makes the fish more enjoyable to eat. When a monger removes the bone from seafood, it generally implies that he is preparing the fish for the consumer to avoid possible injuries and to enhance the overall eating experience. 4. Market value: Fresh fish holds significant market value. By offering fresh, deboned fish for sale or consumption, the monger is creating a desirable product that consumers are more likely to purchase. It makes perfect sense for a business perspective, as the monger is catering to the needs and preferences of the consumers. 5. Relevance: Comparing all the mentioned possibilities: octopus, skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth, none of the other options are as closely associated with a monger as fresh fish is. Octopus could be an alternative, but it's not as universally consumed or widely associated with the role of a monger. The other options – a skeleton, human body, and dog’s mouth – are not typical items for consumption and are generally irrelevant in the context of a monger serving food. In conclusion, \\"fresh fish\\" aligns with human common sense because it is the most fitting answer based on the various factors explained above. Context, cultural familiarity, food safety, market value, and relevance all play a crucial role in making \\"fresh fish\\" the most suitable choice in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Josef Mengele (German: ['jo:zef 'meNG@l@]; 16 March 1911 - 7 February 1979) was a German Schutzstaffel (SS) officer and physician in Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Mengele was a member of the team of doctors responsible for the selection of victims to be killed in the gas chambers and for performing deadly human experiments on prisoners. Context: Mengele was born the eldest of three children on 16 March 1911 to Karl and Walburga (Hupfauer) Mengele in Gunzburg, Bavaria, Germany. His younger brothers were Karl Jr and Alois. Mengele's father was founder of the Karl Mengele & Sons company, producers of farm machinery. Mengele did well in school and developed an interest in music, art, and skiing. He completed high school in April 1930 and went on to study medicine at Goethe University Frankfurt and philosophy at the University of Munich. Munich was the headquarters of the Nazi Party. In 1931 Mengele joined the Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten, a paramilitary organization that was absorbed into the Nazi Sturmabteilung (Storm Detachment; SA) in 1934. In 1935, Mengele earned a PhD in anthropology from the University of Munich. In January 1937, at the Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene in Frankfurt, he became the assistant to Dr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, a scientist conducting genetics research, with a particular interest in twins. As an assistant to von Verschuer, Mengele focused on the genetic factors resulting in a cleft lip and palate or cleft chin. His thesis on the subject earned him a cum laude doctorate in medicine in 1938. Both of his degrees were later rescinded by the issuing universities. In a letter of recommendation, von Verschuer praised Mengele's reliability and his ability to verbally present complex material in a clear manner. The American author Robert Jay Lifton notes that Mengele's published work did not deviate much from the scientific mainstream of the time, and would probably have been viewed as valid scientific efforts even outside Nazi Germany. On 28 July 1939, Mengele married Irene Schonbein, whom he had met while working as a medical resident in Leipzig. Their only son, Rolf, was born in 1944. Question: Did he have any siblings?.

I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches.

A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the situation, the correct answer to the question \\"Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches?\\" would be: A: Apples The justification for this answer is as follows: 1. It is mentioned that candying the fruit allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year, while fresh fruit typically has a much shorter shelf life. 2. Dan decided to candy some of the fruits, including apples. This means that the apples have gone through the process of being candied, which, as mentioned earlier, allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. 3. Dan didn't candy peaches, so they remained fresh. Fresh fruits typically have a shorter shelf life in comparison to their candied counterparts. As a result, the candied apples are expected to retain their quality for a longer period compared to the fresh peaches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they approach the airport the plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. They find their Swedish business partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie (Olivia Thirlby), an American, and her Australian friend Anne (Rachel Taylor). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an aurora. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is disintegrated. The invisible entities begin hunting and disintegrating people, sending them into a panic. Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for seven days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. They find the city full of scorched cars and cinders, but empty of people, except for a wary old woman who warns them of \\"the ghosts\\". Ben and Sean search for supplies in a police car near Red Square while the others hide in the nearby GUM department store shopping mall. While they are searching the car, a barking dog discovers and fatally confronts an alien, but the dog is disintegrated. Ben and Sean successfully hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing the car's lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the men run to the mall. Sean realizes that light bulbs give the aliens away. The group takes shelter in one of the mall stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorises that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not through glass. The group finds the American Embassy gutted and lifeless.

How is \\"in writing. - (NL) Car drivers tend to drive faster abroad than in their own countries, and will also more readily indulge in illegal parking whilst there.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"Kirjallisesti ilmaistuna: \\"Autoilijat ajavat usein nopeammin ulkomailla kuin omassa maassaan, ja he myös syyllistyvät helpommin laittomaan pysäköintiin siellä ollessaan.\\" This Finnish translation captures the idea of the original statement: car drivers tend to drive faster abroad than in their own countries, and they are also more likely to engage in illegal parking while there. In detail, here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Kirjallisesti ilmaistuna\\" translates to \\"in writing\\" or \\"put into words\\" and is an equivalent way to express the original phrase \\"in writing.\\" - \\"Autoilijat\\" means \\"car drivers\\" in Finnish. - \\"Ajavat\\" refers to \\"driving\\" in the context of operating a vehicle. - \\"Usein\\" means \\"often\\" or \\"frequently.\\" - \\"Nopeammin\\" is the comparative form of \\"fast\\" or \\"quickly\\" and translates to \\"faster.\\" - \\"Ulkomailla\\" means \\"abroad\\" or \\"in foreign countries.\\" - \\"Kuin\\" means \\"than\\" and is used here to compare their driving speeds in their own country versus abroad. - \\"Omassa maassaan\\" translates to \\"in their own country.\\" - \\"He myös\\" means \\"they also\\" or \\"they as well.\\" - \\"Syyllistyvät\\" refers to \\"commit\\" or \\"engage in\\" when discussing an action, such as engaging in illegal parking. - \\"Helpommin\\" means \\"more readily\\" or \\"easier\\" and is the comparative form of \\"easily\\" or \\"readily.\\" - \\"Laittomaan pysäköintiin\\" means \\"illegal parking.\\" \\"Laittomaan\\" means \\"illegal,\\" and \\"pysäköintiin\\" means \\"parking.\\" - \\"Siellä ollessaan\\" translates to \\"while there\\" or \\"while being there,\\" referring to being abroad. So the full translation in Finnish, \\"Autoilijat ajavat usein nopeammin ulkomailla kuin omassa maassaan, ja he myös syyllistyvät helpommin laittomaan pysäköintiin siellä ollessaan,\\" conveys the same meaning as the original English statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a detailed explanation of the roles of various stakeholders in ensuring people receive appropriate immunizations and direct care services: 1. Government Agencies: National, state, and local government agencies play a significant role in delivering immunizations and direct care services to the public. These agencies develop and implement vaccination programs, allocate funding for vaccines and healthcare services, and establish guidelines to ensure the safe and effective administration of immunizations. Examples of government entities involved in this process include national health departments, ministries of health, and public health organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. 2. Healthcare Organizations: Public and private healthcare organizations, including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers, provide immunizations and direct care services to patients. These institutions are responsible for ensuring that their staff members are trained to administer vaccines, that their facilities are properly equipped to store and manage vaccines, and that they follow the latest guidance and recommendations from public health authorities. Healthcare organizations may also collaborate with government agencies and nonprofits to reach underserved populations and provide access to essential healthcare services. 3. Healthcare Professionals: Medical professionals, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and healthcare support workers, are involved in the administration of immunizations and the provision of direct care services. They are responsible for ensuring that patients receive the appropriate vaccinations, educating patients about the benefits and risks associated with immunizations, and monitoring patients for potential side effects. Healthcare professionals also play a critical role in maintaining accurate patient records, including vaccination history, to inform future care decisions. 4. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): NGOs and non-profit organizations can significantly contribute to immunization and direct care services' availability and accessibility. These groups may partner with government agencies or healthcare organizations to develop targeted vaccination campaigns, raise awareness about the importance of immunizations, and provide funding or resources for vaccine delivery in underserved communities. Some examples of NGOs active in this area include Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF. 5. Pharmaceutical Companies: The companies that develop and manufacture vaccines are also essential players in the immunization and direct care landscape. They are responsible for researching, developing, and producing safe and effective vaccines, working with regulatory agencies to secure approval for their products, and ensuring a reliable supply of vaccines is available to meet the needs of public health programs. 6. Individuals and Families: Responsibility for immunizations and direct care services also extends to individuals and their families. Every person should strive to stay informed about recommended vaccinations and follow the schedules and guidelines provided by healthcare professionals. Parents and guardians have the responsibility to ensure their children receive the necessary immunizations and care as they grow. In conclusion, providing immunizations and direct care services is a collaborative effort that involves various stakeholders, such as government agencies, healthcare organizations, healthcare professionals, NGOs, pharmaceutical companies, and individuals themselves. Each of these stakeholders has a distinct role to play in ensuring that the population has access to safe and effective health services, ultimately improving public health outcomes and safeguarding communities against vaccine-preventable diseases."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Punctuation: The first sentence uses a comma after the year \\"1944,\\" while the second sentence does not. In this case, the use of a comma in the first sentence follows the conventional rule of using a comma after an introductory phrase. 2. Article usage: The second sentence has an additional article 'the' before \\"Santa Maria Valley Railroad,\\" whereas the first sentence does not have it.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"In order to determine whether you are currently in your comfort zone, it is important to first understand what the term \\"comfort zone\\" means. A comfort zone refers to a psychological state in which a person feels at ease, in control, and experiences low anxiety and stress. It is essentially a space where one's daily activities and behaviors fit a pattern and routine that minimizes stress and risk. Having a clear understanding of your comfort zone can be useful in determining your current state and whether you are optimally challenged for personal and professional growth. To know if you are in your comfort zone, consider the following aspects: 1. Emotional state: If you feel relaxed, safe, and at ease on a regular basis, it is highly likely that you are in your comfort zone. Alternatively, if you feel anxious or uncertain most of the time, you may be operating outside of your comfort zone or experiencing a high level of stress. 2. Level of challenge: Assess whether your current tasks, goals, or activities provide you with a sense of challenge. If you consistently find yourself easily accomplishing tasks without feeling challenged or motivated to push yourself, you might be within your comfort zone. 3. Personal growth: Evaluate your growth in various aspects of your life, such as your career, personal relationships, and health. If you notice a plateau in these areas, or if you feel as though you have not made any significant progress in a long time, it could be an indication that you are in your comfort zone. 4. Routine and predictability: If your daily activities follow a familiar and predictable pattern with minimal variations or surprises, you are likely operating within your comfort zone. While routine and predictability can provide a sense of stability and security, it can also hinder personal growth and development. 5. Fear of taking risks: If you find yourself consistently avoiding new opportunities, challenges, or experiences due to fear of the unknown or fear of failure, you are likely staying in your comfort zone. Stepping out of your comfort zone often involves taking risks and embracing uncertainties. As for the two questions, they can indeed be considered paraphrases of each other. Both questions aim to explore how an individual can identify whether they are in their comfort zone or not. The slight differences in wording do not affect the overall intent and meaning of the questions, as both seek to uncover the same information about recognizing one's comfort zone. In answering these questions, the same elements and considerations apply, such as observing emotions, challenges, routines, and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While stocks have experienced a marginal decline, the dollar has faced a sharp downturn, catching the attention of investors and financial analysts alike. Starting with the stocks, it appears that a slight decrease has affected the market in early trading. Several factors might be contributing to this particular development. Speculations of economic or political changes, a shift in market sentiment, or an increase in portfolio adjustments by investors are some of the possibilities. However, these minor fluctuations are not uncommon and could stabilize as the trading day progresses. On the other hand, the dollar's value has taken a dramatic hit with a substantial decrease in early trading. Multiple elements could be influencing this decline, including global economic uncertainties, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changing expectations on future interest rates. Investors worry about the potential implications of this significant drop on purchasing power, a crucial component of global commerce. Moreover, this downward trend in the dollar's value might also have wider consequences for import and export activities, ultimately affecting the global economy. Investors should keep a keen eye on relevant news updates and take proactive steps to adapt their strategies accordingly. In summary, early trading has revealed a modest dip in stock values and a conspicuous drop in the dollar's performance. Both investors and traders would be wise to remain attentive to these fluctuations.

Write an article based on this summary: – When bombs began raining from the sky at Pearl Harbor, John Anderson—in a turret aboard the USS Arizona—thought immediately of his twin brother, Jake, on deck. It appears Jake never left his mind. Forced into a rescue boat, Anderson reached shore only to grab a spare boat and return to the Arizona to search for his brother, to no avail. Anderson did pick up three survivors, but then his boat was blown apart and \\"I was the only one left alive,\\" he later said, per the Washington Post. Anderson was told Jake was killed by gunfire, but his body was never recovered from the Arizona, which sank. Yet on the 75th anniversary of the attack, John Anderson will be reunited with his brother at last as his ashes are to be interred on the wreck of the ship following his death last year. More coverage: Former Navy fireman Edward Waszkiewicz, 95, recalls seeing the Arizona get hit, per the Ventura County Star. \\"I thought the end of the world was coming. Pieces of the ship fell everywhere,\\" he says. \\"Then all hell broke loose.\\" With a book excerpt, Time dives into the \\"downright spooky\\" mystery of an ad published in the New Yorker two weeks before the attack that might have been a warning. At the Post, historians describe how Pearl Harbor \\"absolutely shattered Americans' image of themselves,\\" yet also crafted a world power of the 21st century. In a separate piece, the Post probes what might have happened if the Japanese hadn't attacked Pearl Harbor, concluding \\"it's quite likely that the two sides would have still clashed.\\" NBC News notes some 4,000 people are expected to attend a commemoration ceremony at Pearl Harbor on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the Chicago Tribune notes this anniversary is different for one Illinois woman: The remains of her uncle, who was 22 when he died at Pearl Harbor, have finally been identified. Efforts to identify other remains and return them to loved ones are ongoing.","completion":"Once upon a time, there were twin brothers named John and Jake Anderson. They both worked on a big ship called the USS Arizona. One day, something very sad and scary happened called the Pearl Harbor attack. This is when planes dropped bombs and started a big fire on the ship. John was inside the ship when it happened, and he was very worried about his brother, Jake, who was outside on the deck. John managed to get to shore safely, but as soon as he could, he got another boat and went back to the ship to look for his brother. Unfortunately, he couldn't find Jake. John did save three other people, but then another explosion happened, and he was the only one left alive in the boat. Later, John found out that Jake didn't make it, but they couldn't find his body. The USS Arizona, where they both worked, sank. 75 years later, when John passed away, his family decided to put his ashes on the sunken ship so that he could be with his brother again. This sad event called Pearl Harbor changed a lot of things for Americans, but it also made the country stronger. Many people remember what happened, and they try to find out what happened to their loved ones who were there. There are big ceremonies to remember the attack, and even important leaders, like the Prime Minister of Japan, sometimes come to visit the site to pay their respects. This year, a lady from Illinois was special because she found out what happened to her uncle who was only 22-years-old when he died at Pearl Harbor.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...

One evening the local sheriff, Royce Spalding, leaves the family dinner table to investigate trouble at the rail yards. He dies after being accidentally shot by a young black boy, Wylie. Local white vigilantes tie Wylie to a truck and drag his body through town, for all the community to see, before hanging him from a tree. The sheriff's widow, Edna Spalding, is left to raise her children alone and maintain the family farm. The bank has a note on the farm and money is scarce; the price for cotton is plummeting and many farms are going under. The local banker, Mr. Denby, pays her a visit. He begins to pressure her to sell the farm as he doesn't see how she can afford to make the loan payments on her own let alone run the farm. A drifter and handyman, a black man by the name of Moses, appears at her door one night, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on all her acres and cites his experience. Edna declines to hire him but offers him a meal instead and sends him on his way. In desperation, Moses steals some of her silver spoons before he leaves. Similarly desperate, Edna finally resolves to keep her family together on the farm no matter what. When the police capture Moseswith her stolen silver, and bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna seizes the opportunity. She lies to the police and says he is her hired man.

It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian. Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas. contains an answer for the question: What border is represented at the true 103rd meridian?, what is it ?

It's the second time in two days and yes, I do see movies I like as many times as is necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and Goldsworthy's works. This morning when I threw the coins I received #29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I received the 5th line changing which moved to #7 The Army. To Blake Art was a War. Anyway, I knew I had to see the film again. I read one of the few reviews extant Online from the SF Examiner. The critic loved the film but said Goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film. He'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of that as I watched this second time. Yesterday I thought that I'd vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well today I could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say. Could I enjoy the film without his comments? What he is doing, what he is saying goes way beyond \\"art\\".

The author acknowledges Goldsworthy's deep understanding of natural elements and even compares him to Lao Tsu or an Avatar, exhibiting strong appreciation. Additionally, the writer proclaims that they would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as \\"King of the World,\\" an exaggeration to showcase their praise. However, there are moments of contrasting thoughts within the text. The author discusses reading a review in which the critic found Goldsworthy's comments distracting from the film. This shows that there is an opposing view, but it does not significantly impact the overall positive sentiment as the author acknowledges that Goldsworthy's words and works surpass the notion of traditional art, adding depth to the film.

Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Team W had more people receiving the first antiviral drug. This can be inferred from the fact that Team W had many people with HIV among its members. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and the development of antiretroviral drugs (a type of antiviral drug) has increased rapidly due to the AIDS epidemic. The first antiviral drug, interferon, is a naturally produced substance by immune cells in response to infections. This serves as a hint that antiviral drugs would be administered to individuals with viral infections, like those in Team W.

Labour says occupied 'granny flats' are already council tax exempt. Article:","completion":"Title: Exploring the Potential of 'Granny Flats' to Increase Housing Supply: A Comprehensive Analysis Introduction The demand for affordable housing has reached an all-time high in recent years, and governments around the world have been struggling to provide adequate housing solutions for the ever-growing population. In an attempt to tackle this escalating issue, ministers in the UK are considering the promotion of 'granny flats', which could potentially increase housing supply significantly. While Labour Party representatives argue that these structures are already exempt from council tax when occupied, the concept of granny flats brings forth a number of valuable points for discussion. Examining The Current Housing Crisis The UK's housing crisis has been making headlines for some time now, with millions of people finding it difficult to secure a home within their budget. To put things into perspective, the country needs to build around 250,000 homes annually just to keep pace with demand. However, the actual number of homes being built has been consistently falling short, resulting in an ever-widening gap between supply and demand. This, in turn, has put immense pressure on existing housing facilities, leading to higher property prices and rent. Granny Flats: The Solution? Granny flats, or secondary dwellings on the same property as the main house, have emerged as a potential solution to the housing conundrum. Ministers believe that the promotion of granny flats, whether by converting existing structures or building new ones, could help to alleviate the housing shortage. These self-contained housing units typically provide comfortable accommodation for an elderly relative, a younger family member, or tenants seeking affordable rental options. The Advantages of Granny Flats There are several reasons why granny flats could be the key to addressing the housing supply issue. Some of the prime benefits include: 1. Utilising available space: Granny flats take up space that is already available on a property, such as a backyard or an unused portion of a house. This allows homeowners to make better use of their property without the need to purchase additional land. 2. Providing affordable housing opportunities: The units can be rented out at a reasonable rate, thus offering an affordable housing option to those struggling to find a suitable place to live. 3. Promoting multi-generational living: Granny flats enable families to live closely together without compromising each other's privacy. This fosters stronger relationships among family members while reducing the financial burden on each party. 4. Generating rental income: Homeowners can earn a reliable passive income through renting out the granny flats, which can be used to pay off their mortgage faster or to save money for other investments. 5. Boosting the local economy: An increase in granny flats will lead to a surge in demand for building and renovation services, which in turn creates job opportunities and stimulates economic growth. Labour's Concerns The Labour Party argues that occupied granny flats are already exempt from council tax, hinting that further incentives might be unnecessary. However, it's vital to fully understand the potential benefits that encouraging granny flat constructions can bring. Streamlined regulations, appropriate financial support, and the promotion of good design can all work in concert to make granny flats genuinely beneficial to both homeowners and those seeking affordable accommodation. Conclusion In conclusion, the concept of promoting granny flats to increase housing supply offers an intriguing solution to the UK's housing crisis. By utilising already available spaces and providing affordable options for the population, this approach has the potential to contribute to the alleviation of the housing shortage significantly. If well-executed, the implementation of policies that encourage the widespread construction and occupancy of granny flats could ultimately prove to be a game-changer in tackling this long-standing issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His family was Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jewish Ukrainian immigrants who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, while his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Spielberg usually supports U.S. Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over 800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and worked with the President for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled The American Journey. It was shown at America's Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because of his disapproval of the organization's anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007 the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg's movies after he donated 1 million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama. In February 2008, Spielberg pulled out of his role as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government's inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement that \\"I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual.\\" It also said that \\"Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more..\\" The International Olympic Committee respected Spielberg's decision, but IOC president Jacques Rogge admitted in an interview that \\"[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.\\" Spielberg's statement drew criticism from Chinese officials and state-run media calling his criticism \\"unfair\\". In September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage by issuing a statement following their donation of 100,000 to the \\"No on Proposition 8\\" campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. Spielberg supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 election. He donated US1 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC.

Roosegaarde says an indoor experiment has already proved it works and he is confident the results--with the help of a team of scientists and engineers--can be copied outside.\\"Beijing is quite good because the smog is quite low. It's in a valley so there's not so much wind.It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get rid of the smog so you can see the sun again.\\" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a complete solution to Beijing's serious and terrible air pollution.\\"This is not the real answer for smog.The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles,\\" he says. However, he hopes the project will make a difference by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.\\"I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,\\" he says.He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used. Roosegaarde's studio has worked on several projects that use static electricity in unusual ways:creating a road that charges electric cars and a floor that generates electricity when danced on. Question: Why is the project carried out in Beijing? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because the environment suits the project.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Because the environment suits the project.\\" The project is carried out in Beijing because the smog is quite low and it is in a valley with not much wind, making it a suitable environment to explore this technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a well known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first pitched Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being \\"too cerebral\\". When the series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode. This time, rather than exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spock, who used to serve under Pike, has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for Talos IV, a planet which is off-limits (the punishment is death) since Pike and Spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions. There's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of Trek, had NBC not turned down the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who was unable to return in The Menagerie) play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk usually is and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality hadn't been fully established yet: this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite Vulcan spontaneously grins. In short, not just a great \\"mystery\\" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down The Cage in its original form (it's available as part of the Season 3 box set). How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"I would describe the sentiment of this review as positive and appreciative. The reviewer seems impressed with how Roddenberry connected The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe in The Menagerie, highlighting the creative use of flashbacks and the unique narrative structure. They also enjoyed seeing the early days of Pike and Spock's characters, and appreciate the episode as a treat for those unable to find The Cage in its original form. Overall, the review expresses enthusiasm and admiration for the episode and its contribution to the Star Trek canon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: If Jim opens his water tap so that the water moves slower, what will happen to the energy levels of the water they will decrease or they will increase? Paragraph : Faster-moving water has more energy. Answer:","completion":"If Jim opens his water tap so that the water moves slower, the energy levels of the water will decrease. This is based on the information provided in the paragraph which states that faster-moving water has more energy. When the speed of the water flow is reduced by adjusting the water tap, the kinetic energy of the water molecules will also decrease. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of an object's velocity, according to the equation: Kinetic energy = (1/2) × mass × (velocity)^2 Since the water is now moving at a slower pace, the kinetic energy will be lower than when it was moving quickly. This reduced energy signifies that the water, in general, possesses a lower level of energy when it is flowing slower compared to when it is flowing faster. In conclusion, adjusting the water tap to slow down the water flow will result in a decrease in the energy levels of the water, as the paragraph clearly explains that faster-moving water carries more energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The right side of the equation consists of 3001*h, 1072160, and 43912. Since 1072160 and 43912 are both constants, add them together. 1072160 + 43912 = 1116072 So, the equation becomes: -12500*h = 3001*h + 1116072 Step 2: Move the variable terms to one side of the equation. To isolate the variable h, move the 3001*h term from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, subtract 3001*h from both sides of the equation. -12500*h - 3001*h = 3001*h - 3001*h + 1116072 This simplifies to: -15501*h = 1116072 Step 3: Solve for the variable h.

Here is a news article: Over at the Wall Street Journal today, Michael Bender has a rare profile of Steve Bannon, focusing on how he became a sworn foe of globalization. It's all because his father, Marty, lost his retirement savings when he sold his cherished AT&T stock at a loss during the 2008 financial crisis: On Oct. 7, 2008, in the cramped TV room of his modest home here, Marty Bannon watched with alarm as plunging stock markets dragged down his shares of AT&T, the nest egg he built during a 50-year career at the company....As he toggled between TV stations, financial analysts warned of economic collapse and politicians in Washington seemed to mirror his own confusion. So he did the unthinkable. He sold. Marty Bannon, now 95 years old, still regrets the decision and seethes over Washington’s response to the economic crisis....“That day, I found out how dumb the people were who I thought were smart,” he says. “They couldn’t control the situation, and it escalated during the day. I said, this thing is going so fast I’m going to be totally wiped out.” Marty Bannon says he lost more than 100,000 because he sold the shares for less than he paid for them. It was a decision he made without consulting a broker or his family....[On] Oct. 6, financial analyst Jim Cramer told “Today” show viewers to pull money from the stock market if they needed any cash for the next five years. Steve Bannon says the warning spooked his father. God knows I empathize with Marty Bannon. The 2008 financial crisis did indeed demonstrate how dumb a lot of supposedly smart people were. Still, something about this story doesn't add up. Here are two charts showing the price of AT&T stock: There's no question that October 2008 was a tough month for stocks, including AT&T. Marty Bannon didn't quite sell at the bottom, but he came close. AT&T closed at around 26 on October 7. But that's about the same price it sold at between 2002 and 2006. And it's more than it sold for during Marty Bannon's 50-year career at AT&T. If he accumulated AT&T stock from around 1945 to 1995, he would have ended up with shares in a bunch of local operating companies after the company was dismembered in 1984, and his split/breakup/spinoff-adjusted cost basis would have been—well, beats me. But by 2008 it couldn't have been more than a few dollars. Unless he bought practically his entire nest egg during the 2007-08 boom or the dotcom bubble of the late 90s, there's really no way that he posted a net loss when he sold, let alone a 100,000 loss. I realize this sounds like a pedantic response to a retiree's loss during the financial crisis, and I wouldn't bother with it if it weren't being offered as an explanation for the political views of one of the most powerful men in America. But the fact remains: AT&T stock fell during 2008, but only to where it had been in 2006. Anyone who bought AT&T stock during the aughts would have broken even selling at the bottom of the crisis, and anyone who bought their stock during the second half of the 20th century would have made a big profit. Beyond that, it sounds like Marty Bannon was a victim of Jim Cramer, not the US government or even Wall Street. And what does globalization have to do with any of this anyway? Blame for the financial crisis lies with the mortgage industry, the derivatives hotshots on Wall Street, and the Bush administration for lousy oversight. But that's about it. So what's going on here?

Not so bad of a wait for a popular restaurant on a night where people were ready to grub before hittin' up da clubs.

The meat was cooked perfectly medium for my taste. We also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 regular fries and onion rings for the table. I liked how the sweet potato fries came out with this delicious honey dipping sauce and there was powdered sugar all over them. You definitely don't need to order any dessert if you get these fries.

You will need a prescription from within the last year to order contacts, so always ask your eye doctor for a copy after an exam. If you are considering trying to order contacts without an up-to-date prescription, know that online sellers are required to contact your doctor to verify your prescription. Available options: [a].

Ask if your eye doctor will match online prices. If they will, this offers the best of both worlds. Saving money on contact lenses is essential, as it can be a significant recurring expense for those who wear them regularly. One way to achieve this in addition to keeping a current prescription is by asking your eye doctor if they are willing to match the prices you find online. There are several benefits to this approach: 1. Convenience: Having your eye doctor match online prices allows you to combine the services of a local provider with the affordability of online shopping. This arrangement means you can avoid the hassle of shopping around online, waiting for shipping, and potential issues with ordering from an unknown vendor while still taking advantage of competitive prices. 2. Professional support and guidance: Utilizing your eye doctor's services for purchasing contact lenses ensures that you have the professional guidance and support you need. Your eye doctor can help you find an appropriate brand and fit, and advise on proper care and handling of your contact lenses due to their familiarity with your eyes and prescription. 3. Supporting local businesses: By purchasing contact lenses through your eye doctor, you're supporting a local business, directly benefiting your community, and enhancing the local economy. 4. Potential for additional discounts and offers: Some eye doctors may offer incentives or special deals on contact lenses when matching online prices, or they might have a rewards program in place for loyal customers. Be sure to inquire about these possibilities. 5. Timely updates: When your prescription changes or it's time for a check-up, your eye doctor will be able to make necessary adjustments and provide you with the most suitable lenses, ensuring that your vision remains clear and comfortable.

Write a title for this article: Marvel fans attending Disney’s D23 Expo event at Anaheim in California were today given an exclusive peek at the studio's forthcoming Captain America: Civil War, released next summer. An excitable, if somewhat jetlagged Chris Evans (Captain America) and Sam Wilson (Falcon) introduced the never-before-seen trailer for the film to the 8000-strong crowd – Evans promising them that what they were about to see was \\"so good\\". Also in attendance was Marvel President Kevin Feige (yet again, we were reminded that it's pronounced \\"Fy-gee)\\", who told the audience that, while the first Captain America film was a period drama with a superhero twist, and the second a political thriller, this third film will be \\"something else\\" altogether. The action-packed trailer itself featured a host of familiar faces, including Captain America and Falcon, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Robert Downey Junior's Iron Man, who tells Captain America \\"I want to punch you in your perfect teeth\\". The footage opens with a chase between Captain America and Black Widow and Frank Grillo's villain Crossbones, last seen in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Later on, it features a brief appearance from Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, and a scene featuring Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, who is seen meeting Captain America, and becoming extremely, embarassingly starstruck. \\"I know you know a lot of super people. So thanks for thinking of me,\\" he says. There were also several hints at the rifts to come withing the film – at one point, Iron Man/Stark appears to reference the contentious Superhero Registration Act (over which he and Captain America later clash), stating: \\"Without boundaries, we're no better than the bad guys\\". The atmosphere in the hall during the presentation was extremely positive one – at some points, it felt as if the crowd were cheering and clapping at arbitrary moments, just for the sheer fun of it. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the trailer received a decidedly rapturous reception, complete with screams and impassioned (and somehow recogniseably American) whoops of joy. That said, the cheers felt well-deserved: like most of Marvel' fare in recent years, the trailer was colourful, exciting, and had almost everything fans could want. If we had one complaint? Unless he was extremely well hidden, there was absolutely no sign of Tom Holland's Spiderman.","completion":"\\"Captain America: Civil War Sneak Peek - Superheroes Unite and Excitement Builds at Disney's D23 Expo!\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the 1920s and 30s the airlines were just beginning. It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

A: Pick your answer from: (A). neutrons (B). protons (C). magnetrons (D). electrons Answer:","completion":"D. electrons Step 1: Analyze the question - The question asks about the cause of magnetism within atoms. Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices - We have to consider each option and determine which one is responsible for magnetism. (A) Neutrons: Neutrons are uncharged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. Since they have no charge, they do not contribute to an atom's magnetic properties. (B) Protons: Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. While they do have a charge, their movement within the nucleus does not directly contribute to atom's magnetic properties. (C) Magnetrons: Magnetrons are not particles within atoms but rather a type of vacuum tube used in electronics, so this option is unrelated to the question. (D) Electrons: Electrons are negatively charged particles, and they move in orbits around the nucleus of an atom. The movement of electrons, including their spin and orbital motion, can contribute to an atom's magnetic properties.

Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists.

Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Today we bring you an old tale. It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas... Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"We can infer from the passage that houses built with bales of straw can be strong, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient. Additionally, there is a growing interest in straw bale houses as a response to climate change and their low home operating expenses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R.

Just like in traditional gambling settings, there is always a risk of losing money. However, by taking the right steps and preparing adequately before participating in online casinos, you can increase your chances of success. Here are some helpful strategies and tips to help you make money while gambling online: 1. Choose the right casino: Research extensively and ensure you select a reputable, licensed, and secure online casino. This not only ensures fair and transparent gameplay but can also protect your personal and financial information from cybercriminals. 2. Learn and understand the games: Spend some time understanding the rules, odds, and strategies of various casino games before starting to invest money. The more familiar you are with the games, the better your chances of making the right decision in-game. Popular games such as poker, blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and slot machines all have different strategies that can help you gain an edge. 3. Take advantage of bonuses and promotions: Many online casinos offer welcome bonuses, loyalty programs, and cashback rewards for players. Make the most of these promotions to increase your chances of winning and boosting your bankroll. 4. Manage your bankroll: Proper bankroll management is essential when gambling online. Set and stick to a budget, never bet more than you can afford to lose, and be disciplined with your betting decisions. It can help protect you from significant losses and extend your playtime. 5. Develop a betting strategy: Access resources online and learn different betting strategies such as the Martingale system, the Paroli system, or card counting in games like blackjack. These strategies can help you minimize losses and maximize your winnings. 6. Practice in free mode: Many online casinos offer free or demo modes where you can practice popular games without risking real money. Use these opportunities to refine your skills and strategies before jumping into real money games. 7. Concentrate on a single game or genre: Specializing in a game or genre can help you become genuinely proficient and increase your chances of making consistent profit. For instance, you may choose to focus on poker, blackjack, or slots – all of which have different skill sets and strategies for success. 8. Quit while you're ahead: It's important to know when to walk away from the virtual tables. There will always be good and bad days, so set a winning limit for yourself, and once you hit it, take a break or withdraw your winnings. Being emotionally controlled and disciplined can improve your overall profitability in the long run. 9. Join online casino communities: Participating in online casino forums and discussion groups can help you gain valuable insights from experienced players, learn helpful tricks and strategies, and remain updated with any changes or news in the industry. 10. Always play responsibly: Remember to treat gambling as a form of entertainment and not rely on it as a primary source of income. Understand that gambling involves risks, and ensure you gamble responsibly to make it a fun and enjoyable experience. In conclusion, making money on online casinos isn't just about luck or chance. It requires discipline, preparation, and intelligent decision-making. By applying these strategies and maintaining a responsible approach to gambling, you can improve your chances of success and increase your winnings over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But what happened on Tuesday was both extraordinary and unprecedented. The resignation of an American national security adviser had Russian politicians reacting furiously and jumping to Michael Flynn's defence. At the upper house of the Russian parliament, senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted that Mr Flynn was the victim of \\"paranoia and a witch hunt\\". In a message posted online, the head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, Konstantin Kosachev, claimed that \\"either Donald Trump has been driven into a corner or the new administration has been permeated with Russopohobia from top to bottom\\". The language from Moscow is both colourful and angry. That is because the Russians had high hopes for Mr Flynn. They saw him as an influential figure who championed closer ties between America and Russia. Mr Flynn was well known to Moscow. In the past he was a semi-regular contributor to RT, Russia's state-controlled English-language TV channel. Two years ago, Mr Flynn attended an RT gala dinner in Moscow and sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin. But the Russians are not only disappointed. I detect a degree of embarrassment here, too. As late as yesterday, the Kremlin was continuing to insist that, before President Trump stepped into the White House, there had been no conversations between Moscow and Washington about sanctions. Asked by journalists today about Mr Flynn's resignation, Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin \\"wouldn't like to comment on this\\". \\"It's the internal affair of the Trump administration. It has nothing to do with us. We have commented many times on this subject. We have nothing more to add.\\" I asked Mr Peskov if, after Mr Flynn's resignation, he continued to assert there had been no discussion of sanctions. \\"I repeat: I have nothing more to add. We don't want to comment on this.\\" It's not all bad news for Moscow. Far from it. From the kind of comments he has been making in recent months, Mr Trump comes across as the most pro-Russia president in modern US history; the Russians are still counting on him to improve relations between Moscow and Washington, to ease sanctions and help bring Russia in from the cold. Which is why the Russian state media avoids criticising President Trump; instead, it accuses his alleged \\"opponents\\" and \\"enemies\\" within the US establishment, intelligence services and American media of plotting to undermine Mr Trump's attempts to improve US-Russian ties. And if America's 45th president fails to deliver what Moscow is waiting for? In that case, instead of becoming a partner, America would most likely become the \\"enemy\\" again; a useful scapegoat to deflect attention from Russia's own problems at home.","completion":"Russian politicians reacted furiously to the resignation of US national security adviser Michael Flynn, considering him a victim of paranoia, as they had hoped for closer ties between America and Russia via Flynn's influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.

The roof was sheared off the van during the high-impact crash. Driver credits wearing a seatbelt for saving his life. By. Shari Miller. PUBLISHED:. 11:55 EST, 13 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:57 EST, 13 June 2012. A driver escaped virtually unharmed after his van hurtled into a pair of trees and he found himself trapped within the mangled remains. Delivery driver James Whittaker, 22, was on the A64 near York in the early hours of Saturday morning, when his van left the road and ploughed into a tree on his passenger side, before veering to the right and crashing into another tree. The second tree stopped the vehicle rolling further down an embankment, but the double impact sliced the roof off Mr Whittaker's Vauxhall Vivaro and reduced the van into a twisted heap of metal. The twisted remains of James Whittaker's van after it left the A64 near York and crashed twice into trees. Mr Whittaker, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said he did not remember what caused the crash, but recalled finding himself wedged within the battered van. Miraculously, he did not break a single bone in the impact and came away with superficial wounds. He said: 'Apparently, the police, ambulance and firefighters didn’t expect to find me alive. I’m so lucky. I’ve seen pictures of other crashes and the cars don’t look half as bad as mine. 'I can’t believe I made it out without major injuries. 'All I suffered was a cut to my forehead, a few grazes on my legs and a bruised foot, nothing really. 'The worst injury I had was a cut on my hand from windscreen glass, but even that happened after the crash when I was trying to get out of the van.' Mr Whittaker, who started working for his father's Sheffield-based delivery service, Dedicated Couriers Ltd, had begun his shift at midnight. He said: 'The last thing I remember is making a delivery in Beverley earlier in the night. At the time of the crash I was on the A64, apparently driving from Scarborough to York, but I don’t remember being there.' Mr Whittaker came round after the impact to find a Polish truck driver, who had passed by the accident, calling 999. When ambulance and fire services arrived on the scene they removed him from the wrecked vehicle. The roof of the Vauxhall Vivaro was sliced off in the impact, but miraculously driver James Whittaker escaped relatively unharmed. He explained: 'They didn’t even have to cut the roof off as it was already gone. They just cut some of the steering wheel so I could be pulled out.' The lucky driver was taken off to York Hospital with a neck brace, as a precaution, but a CT scan and x-rays revealed that incredibly, James had not suffered any fractures. He has suffered some memory loss, but doctors have told him he may get his full memory back at some point. Police believe the accident happened around 4am, the same time his Tom Tom navigation system stopped working, but it is still unknown what caused it. Lucky: James Whittaker escaped from the crash with a few superficial cuts and bruises. Mr Whittaker added: 'The Tom Tom system records speed and I wasn’t driving over the speed limit. It was very wet and windy so it could have been that I skidded, and the police say I could have fallen asleep. “But I was talking to my friend on my hands free kit at 3.50am, so I would have been quite alert and the doctor thought it was unlikely that I would have dropped off so quickly.' Looking at pictures of the written-off van, which is undergoing tests to determine if there was a fault with it, Mr Whittaker credited wearing his seat belt for his miraculous escape. He said: “I can’t believe how lucky I was. I just keep thinking, if there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn’t have stood a chance. “My girlfriend Brodie usually comes with me on my Friday night and Saturday morning shift, but luckily this week she came on Wednesday instead. It’s just so lucky she wasn’t with me.” Mr Whittaker added: \\"When I look at pictures of the wreckage, I can't believe I wasn't more badly injured or killed. If there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn't have stood a chance.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? There's someone out there for just about everyone — all you need to do is go find this person. If you don't make any effort to meet new people, try new things, or even leave the house, the odds that you'll find the person who's right for you can be seriously slim. So, if you're looking to find your life partner, start by getting up and getting out! Try to spend at least some of your free time attending fun social events, getting to know new people, and just getting out into the world around you in general. Most dating \\"experts\\" will recommend a proactive approach to dating. Some even rank it as high as your career in terms of the effort you should spend on it! Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to spend every Friday night in a loud, crowded, overpriced nightclub to meet potential dating partners, nor do you have to be an immaculately-dressed, debonair, Hollywood type. While these sorts of approaches work well for some people, most people will have the greatest success finding partners by simply exploring activities that they love. By doing this, you're likely run into people with similar interests and outlooks as you, naturally leading to compatibility. Even solitary hobbies can lead to opportunities to meet people! Love reading comic books and playing video games? Attend a convention! Love painting? Host an exhibition! Like writing? Attend a writer's workshop! There are exciting activities for almost every interest out there, so start searching! You're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with, so isn't it reasonable to assume that both you and your potential life partner should be completely open about who you are? In fact, many people are unwilling to completely \\"open up\\" until they've gotten to know someone intimately. If you can stomach the idea, try to be completely true to yourself from the very get-go through all the stages of a relationship: asking someone out, going on your first few dates, getting to know each other more closely, committing to each other, and beyond! By doing this, you give your partner the chance to fall in love with the real you, rather than forcing them to \\"hold on\\" until you're comfortable being yourself. The path to finding your life partner can seem like a perilous one. It can seem like there's almost no hope you'll find someone who's right for you, especially if you've recently had to deal with romantic setbacks. No matter what you do, don't ever give up hope or give in to the fear that you won't find someone. People all over the world struggle with the same sorts of romantic difficulties that you may be going through right now. Everyone periodically has personal setbacks. There's no single \\"right way\\" to find your life partner, so don't judge yourself against other people or couples. Don't let negative thoughts derail your quest to find a life partner. Confidence, fearlessness, and persistence are key to finding the right person for you! As an added bonus, confidence is generally considered quite sexy! Fearless confidence is a self-reinforcing trait that makes you much more attractive to potential partners: the more confidently you approach dating situations, the more relaxed you'll be during them, the better time you'll have, and the more confident you'll be when you approach the next situation.

A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Paragraph: In Steve's kitchen, there are two burners.

In the given scenario, Burner A is not turned on, and Burner B is set to \\"medium.\\" Since Burner B is turned on, it is generating heat, which warms the air above its surface. As the air above Burner B gets warmer, it expands, leading to a decrease in air density in that region. Consequently, the surface air pressure above Burner B decreases. Higher pressure regions naturally move towards lower pressure regions to establish equilibrium. Burner A, being turned off, does not produce any heat and thus has no influence on the air pressure above its surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface air pressure above Burner A is higher in comparison to Burner B. This phenomenon in Steve's kitchen can be seen as a small-scale example of how pressure differences occur due to surface temperature differences, leading to the creation of air currents, and ultimately, contributing to complex weather phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A man named Michael Fagan, who was 31 at the time, had climbed a wall of Buckingham Palace, crawled through an open window and made his way to the bedroom of Queen Elizabeth II, who was sleeping. When she awakened to find the guy sitting there staring at her, it is fair to surmise that she was not pleased. Especially when Fagan asked her if she had a spare cigarette. This happened on July 9, 1982, generating international headlines, and only because the queen survived unharmed does it read like a comedy of errors. The errors were plentiful, including the queen's repeated attempts to summon help, at first to no avail. But now, 30 years later, during the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in London this week, it is instructive to recall the monarch's rude awakening by the bleeding intruder who was in search of a smoke. We assume that the handful of people at the absolute pinnacle of life -- the queen being the lead example -- have the means and the staffs and the security teams to insulate themselves from indignities that mere mortals have to put up with. Analysis: Why Queen Elizabeth's jubilee celebrations matter to Brits. And, most of the time, they do. But when there are breaches of presumed privacy, boy, does it cause a commotion. Follow CNN's live jubilee blog. We don't have to go back in history to look for instances of this. Just consider what Pope Benedict XVI is thinking right now in the wake of the news that his butler, Paolo Gabriele, has been arrested, accused of having the pope's confidential documents in his home. The investigation is still playing out in Rome, but if the allegations prove true and it turns out that Gabriele, one of the few people who had access to the pope's living quarters, including the pope's desk, lifted the information, then the pope will know with certainty that even with his rarified position, he can't count on personal privacy behind the guarded walls of the Vatican. In the United States, President Ronald Reagan, after an assassination attempt on a Washington sidewalk in the second month of his first term, was assured that efforts would be redoubled to make certain no one who wished to hurt him would be able to get that close again. Nancy Reagan was said to be especially adamant that her husband be kept out of harm's way. So it was almost beyond belief one afternoon in April 1992 when Reagan, out of office but still being protected by the Secret Service, was in Las Vegas to receive an award and was accosted right onstage. Reagan had just been given the award -- a 2-foot-high crystal statue of an eagle -- when a man named Richard Paul Springer, 41, walked through the ring of security around the former president and onto the stage, grabbed the crystal eagle, smashed it forcefully to the floor (with Reagan being struck by the flying glass), and commandeered the microphone. Reagan was hustled offstage by the Secret Service, and Springer, too, was hauled away. But there was widespread incredulity that someone could get past all the federal, local and private security that is always on hand for an appearance by a president or former president. Some breaches are more comical than frightening. Elvis Presley was famously kept away from the gazes and grasping hands of his admirers when he was not performing. His privacy at home was especially important to him. But his old friends and employees sometimes tell the story of what happened when a crate arrived at his home with ventilation holes punched into it. The delivery service said that fans had sent him, as a gift, a top-pedigree dog. So, according to the story, the crate was carted into the house, and was opened. Out climbed two young women. They were escorted off the property. The persistence of those who infringe upon the privacy of the exalted can be astonishing. It turned out that Michael Fagan, the queen's uninvited visitor, had managed to sneak into Buckingham Palace a month earlier and had helped himself to a bottle of wine. For that he was charged with theft -- but was not charged criminally for the subsequent trespass that took him to her sleeping quarters, because at the time it was considered a civil violation. And Squeaky Fromme, sent to prison for a failed assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in 1975, wrote to him while she was incarcerated -- a letter described as \\"strange\\" by Ford. She was able to reach the president once he had left office -- the letter made it to his home, and he read it -- even while she was locked away from society. The oddity of these encounters that happen when the personal space of the most protected people on the planet is violated -- the bizarreness of the moments when they are reminded that nothing in life is guaranteed -- can be both mesmerizing and haunting. Just ask Queen Elizabeth, in the unlikely event you ever get close enough. But you probably shouldn't ask her for a cigarette. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In 1982, Michael Fagan, a 31-year-old man, managed to breach security at Buckingham Palace and enter Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom while she was sleeping. The queen awoke to find Fagan sitting on her bed, wearing a soiled T-shirt and jeans, holding a broken ashtray, and bleeding from a cut on his hand. This incident, which occurred on July 9, generated international headlines and, since the queen was unharmed, is now regarded as a comedy of errors. The numerous mistakes made during this event include the queen's failed attempts to summon help and Fagan asking her for a spare cigarette. This incident reminds us that even the highest-ranking individuals in society, such as the queen, cannot always be completely insulated from the indignities that ordinary people face. Other instances of breaches in personal privacy among high-profile figures include the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI's butler, Paolo Gabriele, for allegedly having the pope's confidential documents in his possession, and an assassination attempt on former US President Ronald Reagan in 1982. While some of these breaches may be more humorous than threatening, they nevertheless highlight the fact that even the most protected individuals in the world can have their personal space violated. In the case of Queen Elizabeth, the intruder, Fagan, had actually managed to sneak into Buckingham Palace a month prior to the notorious bedroom encounter, where he helped himself to a bottle of wine. Consequently, he was charged with theft but not criminally charged for the subsequent trespass that took him to the queen's sleeping quarters since it was considered a civil violation at the time. These unexpected encounters where the personal space of those at the highest echelons of society is invaded can be both captivating and unsettling, serving as a reminder that nothing in life is definitively guaranteed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether you're drizzling it over pancakes or using it to sweeten your favorite cold beverage, syrups are versatile and delicious. Making your own syrup at home brings a whole new level of customization and satisfaction. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of using your homemade syrup immediately or storing it in the refrigerator to ensure the best results in terms of taste and safety. Step 1: Making Your Syrup Homemade syrups are incredibly simple and easy to make. All you need are a few key ingredients such as sugar, water, and any additional flavorings you prefer (e.g., vanilla, cinnamon, or fruit extracts). Combine these ingredients in a saucepan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved entirely. Continue to simmer your mixture for a few minutes to thicken and deepen the flavors. Step 2: Use Your Syrup Immediately Once your syrup is ready, it is best to use it immediately. This not only guarantees the optimum flavor but also ensures that you enjoy a smooth and velvety texture. Freshly made syrup is perfect for enhancing your morning pancakes or waffles, sweetening your hot beverages, or even drizzling over your favorite desserts like ice cream or fruit salads. Step 3: Proper Storage in the Refrigerator If you have made more syrup than you can use immediately or wish to save some for later, proper storage is essential. Cool the syrup to room temperature before transferring it into a clean, airtight container. Glass jars or bottles with secure lids work best for syrup storage. Storing your syrup in the refrigerator helps maintain its freshness and quality. The low temperature slows down any microbial activity, preventing spoilage and extending the shelf life of your homemade syrup. Most homemade syrups can last anywhere between four to six weeks when stored in the refrigerator. Step 4: Reusing and Reheating Your Syrup When you decide to use the stored syrup, make sure you check for any signs of spoilage such as off-odors, mold, or abnormal texture. If your syrup appears to be in good condition, warm it gently in a saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for a few seconds to achieve the desired consistency. Using a clean spoon, stir the syrup well to ensure even heating and flavor distribution. Conclusion: Homemade syrup adds a delightful touch of sweetness and flavor to everyday meals and treats. By using your syrup immediately or storing it carefully in the refrigerator, you'll ensure that you enjoy the magic of homemade syrup at its finest. So, why not try your hand at making your own syrup and experience the satisfaction of enhancing your dishes with your signature touch?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity. At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hillary Clinton blasted for hugging girl after collapse despite having pneumonia HILLARY CLINTON has been blasted for hugging a young girl after collapsing at yesterday’s 9/11 ceremony – despite knowing that she was suffering from contagious pneumonia. A wave of criticism has flooded in as new footage emerged from an alternative angle showing the presidential wannabe swaying before she is helped into the back of a van. The Democratic candidate was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday before she took a tumble at yesterday's \\"incredibly stifling\\" 9/11 memorial service. The illness is spread from person-to-person when people breathe in tiny particles that make it into the air. Someone can easily be infected when a sufferer sneezes while in close proximity to them. Pneumonia causes swelling of the tissue on one or both lungs and symptoms include coughing, rapid heartbeat, fever, and chest pain. Clinton was taken to back to her daughter's apartment after he collapse yesterday and emerged looking happy and relaxed. She then smiled and posed for pictures as she embraced a young girl. The photo-op has been roundly criticised on social media with Twitter user Ed Hansberry posting: \\"Wait? She has pneumonia so bad she passed out from it, yet hugs a little girl today? #HillarysHealth\\" Vic Niederhoffer tweeted: \\"You have to admire someone so healthy she cares to hug a little girl just a day into pneumonia (sic)\\" Matt Walsh tweeted: \\"Why did Hillary Clinton risk exposing this little girl to pneumonia?\\" Clinton has slammed for the move amid reports talks are taking place in the Democratic camp over who might be best placed to replace her in the presidential race . Her opposing candidate Donald Trump has since spoken out and told Fox News that he hoped Clinton would \\"get well soon\\". He said: \\"I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail and we'll be seeing her at the debate.\\" Clinton was due to leave this morning for a two-day trip to California that included fundraisers and a speech on the economy. But on doctor's orders the 68-year-old was forced to cancel the trip. Clinton's doctor Lisa Bardack said in statement: \\"Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. \\"She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. \\"While at this morning's event, she became overheated and dehydrated. \\"I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.\\" The presidential candidate tried to hose down concerns around her health saying that she was \\"feeling great\\" as she left her daughter's apartment. She yelled to press across the street from Chelsea Clinton's apartment: \\"It's a beautiful day in New York.\\" But yesterday's collapse and the cancellation of her California trip is likely to add fuel to internet rumours about her alleged poor health. Footage of Clinton's collapse shows her resting on a concrete barrier as she struggles to stay on her feet. Helpers desperately tried to keep her upright before ushering her into the van. She appears to almost fall to the floor before she is bundled into the vehicle and whisked away. A source told Fox News that Clinton's knees appeared to buckle as she left the service. A spokesman for Clinton, Nick Merrill, said Clinton had attended the service for an hour and 30 minutes. He said: \\"Secretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen. \\"During the ceremony , she felt overheated so departed to go to her daughter's apartment, and is feeling much better.\\" MORE ON #HILLARY per witness: \\"unexpected early departure\\"; she stumbled off curb, \\"knees buckled\\", lost a shoe as she was helped into van — RickLeventhalFoxNews (@RickLeventhal) September 11, 2016 Fox News also reported that the former Secretary of State had to wait for her motorcade for several minutes as her security detail had not realised she would be leaving early. Clinton arrived at the New York ceremony in the morning, wearing dark glasses, having released a statement saying it was important to honour the lives and \\"tremendous spirit\\" of the victims and responders of September 11, 2001. She and opposing candidate Donald Trump both attended the morning service to mark 15 years on from the September 11 attacks, with Trump remaining after she had left. Clinton has been plagued by speculation that she is not fit enough to serve as US President. She was even jokingly challenged to show she could open a jar of pickle to prove she was in good health. The candidate also had her pulse taken as part of the joke. Clips of Clinton appearing to cough up green mucus also sent ripples through the presidential race. Clinton had a coughing fit while speaking at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, and was forced to take a moment to sip some water and recover. Her opposing candidate Trump has used the incidents to claim that Clinton is too weak to serve as the US president, also saying she takes too many naps to properly serve. He also said he had \\"no idea\\" what had happened to Clinton when he was asked about her health following the ceremony. Trump also said he had \\"no idea\\" what had happened to Clinton when he was asked about her health following the ceremony. Clinton emerged from her daughter Chelsea's home two hours after collapse walking unaided and waving to reporters. The Democratic candidate repeatedly said she \\"felt great\\" when asked by journalists but failed to answer questions about what exactly happened. We pay for your stories!

Article: SALT LAKE CITY — Republican Donald Trump appears to have, in his earlier words, \\"a tremendous problem in Utah\\" as a new poll shows him slipping into a dead heat with Democrat Hillary Clinton since crude comments he made about women surfaced last weekend. And along with the billionaire businessman's sudden fall, independent candidate and BYU graduate Evan McMullin surged into a statistical tie with the two major party presidential nominees, according to survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics. \\"A third-party candidate could win Utah as Utahns settle on one,\\" said Quin Monson, Y2 Analytics founding partner. McMullin may well have caught lightning in a bottle. The poll shows Clinton and Trump tied at 26 percent, McMullin with 22 percent and Libertarian Gary Johnson getting 14 percent if the election were held today. Y2 Analytics surveyed 500 likely Utah voters over landlines and cellphones Oct. 10-11 The poll has a plus or minus 4.4 percent margin of error. Also, a majority of voters statewide and specifically Mormons, as well as a near majority of Republicans, say Trump should drop out of the race, according to the poll. The poll shows that 94 percent of Utahns have watched or heard about the video in which Trump had an extremely lewd conversation about women caught on a hot microphone in 2005. Y2 Analytics managing partner Scott Riding called that high percentage \\"astounding\\" for political news. Those who viewed the video felt more strongly that Trump should step aside than those who only heard about it, according to the poll. Republicans, however, are split over whether Trump should go. A cascade of rank-and-file Republicans and GOP leaders in Utah abandoned their support for Trump soon after the video became public. A BYU political science professor described the reaction in Utah as a \\"full-scale revolt\\" against Trump. Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Chris Stewart were among those announcing they would no longer vote for their party's nominee. The Deseret News called for Trump to resign his candidacy. \\"It's quite the cacophony of voices coming from this state,\\" Monson said, adding that doesn't appear to be happening to the same degree nationally or in other states. \\"Utah continues to be quite different in its rejection of Donald Trump.\\" Clinton, too, though hasn't captured Utahns' hearts. Both she and Trump have unfavorability ratings of about 70 percent, according to the poll. \\"These are very deeply disliked candidates,\\" Riding said. McMullin’s ballot strength is striking considering that only 52 percent of voters are aware enough of his candidacy to offer an opinion, according to Y2 Analytics. However, among those that recognize his name, four out of five see him favorably. Boyd Matheson, president of the conservative Sutherland Institute, said there's a distinction in Utah that's becoming more apparent nationally that voters aren't going to settle for political rhetoric on either side of the aisle. \\"It doesn't matter if it's Trump or Clinton, Utahns are saying, 'No, that's not what leadership looks like to us,'\\" Matheson said. Monson said the \\"implosion\\" of the Trump campaign has led to the GOP nominee's share of the vote falling and support migrating to Johnson and more so McMullin. Clinton's numbers have stayed about the same. Born in Utah, McMullin, a former CIA agent and policy director for U.S. House Republicans, entered the race in August as a conservative alternative to the majority party candidates. McMullin soundly beats Trump among those in the poll who identified themselves members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Matheson said McMullin has a unique window over the next five days to come out with an agenda and invite Utahns to be part of something. If so, he could scoop up the Johnson \\"placeholder\\" votes, as well as take some from Trump and Clinton. \\"There's a plausible path that Evan McMullin could win Utah,\\" Matheson said. McMullin responded to the poll Wednesday, saying Utahns can turn the election around, putting him on the path to be the first third party candidate for president to win a state since pro-segregation candidate George Wallace in 1968. \\"Utahns have a special place in this election. What we kept hearing would be impossible, has now happened,\\" McMullin said. \\"This is just the beginning and we will continue to grow our movement well beyond Utah.\\" His campaign said website traffic and volunteer sign ups have jumped more than 400 percent since last month. Trump held a double-digit lead over Clinton, 37 percent to 25 percent, in a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted in August by Dan Jones & Associates. Johnson picked up 16 percent in that survey, which was done before McMullin entered the race. A Public Policy Polling survey of likely Utah voters showed Trump ahead of Clinton 39 percent to 24 percent. Despite his lead in the polls, Trump acknowledged a \\"tremendous problem in Utah\\" during an August campaign speech in Florida to evangelical pastors, saying \\"Utah is a different place.\\" Meantime, seeing a rare opportunity for a Democrat to make inroads in Utah, the Clinton campaign opened an office in Salt Lake City. In March, before either Trump or Clinton had won their respective party nominations, a Deseret News/KSL poll found Utahns poised to vote for a Democrat for president for the first time since 1964. Clinton had a slight edge over Trump, 38 percent to 36 percent, while Democrat Bernie Sanders led Trump 48 percent to 37 percent among likely Utah voters, according to the survey conducted by Dan Jones & Associates. Also, 16 percent said they would skip the election if Trump and Clinton were their ballot choices. Utah voters rejected both Trump and Clinton in the March presidential preference caucus votes. Republicans gave Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a big win over both Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Trump, while Democrats did the same for Sanders. Read more about the poll here. Contributing: Lisa Riley Roche Email: [email protected], Twitter: dennisromboy ||||| With the election only weeks away, Hillary Clinton appears to have the lead and the momentum. As of this writing, the FiveThirtyEight polls-only forecast gives her around an 87 percent chance of winning — up from around 55 percent in late September – and that may not have fully absorbed the fallout of Trump’s lewd video, debatable debate performance or the daily deluge of fresh scandal jeopardizing his candidacy. But if Clinton doesn’t run away with this, there is another candidate who may also have seen his chances of becoming president skyrocket. The third-most likely person to be the next president of the United States: Evan McMullin. It would take a fascinating scenario — in which much of the technical detail of how we select presidents comes into play — for McMullin to be sworn in as the 45th president, but the chances of its happening are slim, not none. Indeed, his chances of at least making things very interesting may be as high as 1 to 3 percent — about the same as the odds of the Cubs’ coming back to beat the Giants on Monday. If you’ve never heard of this person, you’re not alone. With #NeverTrumpers failing to get Mitt Romney, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska or any other high-profile Republicans to enter the race, the task to mount a conservative challenge fell to McMullin, a little-known, 40-year-old former CIA officer. According to the bio on his website, he served in the CIA for about a decade, and spent time in investment banking, as an adviser for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and as policy director for the House Republican Conference. On the issues, McMullin has taken fairly orthodox Republican positions, including supporting free trade. He has been critical of Trump on immigration, refugees, anti-Muslim rhetoric and on temperament and fitness to be president. The idea that an independent candidate could swoop in to win has been largely dismissed, on the grounds that any conservative-leaning third-party candidate would be more likely to hurt Trump than Clinton, thus making a Clinton victory more likely. But McMullin may have one advantage that other second-tier candidates do not: Utah. His path to the presidency basically looks like this: Win Utah Deadlock the Electoral College Win in the House Step 1: Win Utah For step 1, his chances are arguably pretty good. Perhaps there has been no more dire sign that the Trump campaign is struggling than a recent Deseret News poll showing Trump in a dead heat with Clinton in the highly conservative state. But with both major-party candidates getting only 26 percent, the real bombshell is the third-place finisher. McMullin is already polling within striking distance of the leaders, despite his much lower name recognition. Another recent poll showed McMullin a bit further behind, but with Trump still only getting 34 percent of the vote to McMullin’s 20 percent. The FiveThirtyEight model has just been updated to include McMullin in Utah (Nate Silver will have more on how we did that), presently giving him a 3.4 percent chance of winning based on current polling, with the “now-cast” giving him a 9.7 percent chance if the election were held today. But there are a number of reasons I’d be significantly more bullish on McMullin’s chances in his home state. First, McMullin is a Mormon, and while Utah is a deep red state, the heavily Mormon population has not embraced Trumpism. In the Utah Republican Caucuses in March, Trump finished in 3rd place with just 14 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, in those same caucuses, the candidate whom Mitt Romney announced he would vote for — Ted Cruz — received 69 percent of the vote. It’s hard to overstate Romney’s popularity and influence in Utah, and his endorsement could easily put McMullin over the top. (Oh, and McMullin is reportedly using a Romney email list already.) Step 2: Deadlock the Electoral College And now we get to the heart of the issue: Utah could be enough. While McMullin essentially has no chance of winning the election outright, Utah’s six electoral votes could be enough to block any candidate from winning 270 in the electoral college, thus sending the election to Congress. While people speculate about “ties” every cycle, this election may give us our best chance for the equivalent in a long while, though the chances still aren’t good. The model currently puts the chances of a tie at just 0.4 percent — but that is without giving McMullin much of a chance in Utah. Our polls-only forecast estimates about a 1.7 percent chance of Trump’s winning 269-275 electoral votes, including Utah (polls-plus has it as high as 2.4 percent). Any of those would be enough that flipping Utah into McMullin’s column would deadlock the Electoral College. An interesting point about that number is that it’s relatively insensitive to how far Trump is behind. Of course, a close race would be ideal for McMullin, but the chances of the election finishing within the margin of Utah in late September when it was close were still only around 3.1 percent. Essentially, if the race is close, it’s a narrow band between a clear Clinton victory and a clear Trump victory. But if the race isn’t close, it’s a narrow band in the upper range of possible Trump rebounds. So while the odds of a Trump victory have plummeted, the odds of a McMullin miracle — assuming he wins Utah — remain somewhat steady. Step 3: Win in the House After that, the 12th Amendment dictates that the top three presidential vote-getters’ names are sent to the incoming House, with each state delegation getting one vote. The top two electoral-vote-receiving vice presidential candidates are sent to the Senate. The Republican Party, of course, enjoys a significant edge in House delegations and controls 33 of the 50 states. While most project them to lose seats in the election, the scenario we’re interested in — in which Trump rebounds to win nearly half of the electoral votes — would probably not be the disaster it would take for the Republicans to lose nine delegations. Fortunately for McMullin, Republicans haven’t shown Trump a lot of loyalty. Unprecedented numbers of congressional leaders have already abandoned their nominee – and that’s under the working assumption that Clinton is the only alternative. Moreover, it takes an outright majority at this stage for a candidate to win. Based on known defections, somewhere around 35 congressmen are already anti-Trump (to varying degrees), including a majority of Utah’s delegation, and a majority of the Republicans in Nevada’s. So let’s say the Democrats pick up a couple of states in the election, while Utah and Nevada go for McMullin and persuade a few other Republican states to join them right away, such that the breakdowns goes something like – with 26 needed to win — 19 delegations for Clinton, 23 for Trump and eight for McMullin. Now what? Unlike the Electoral College, the House doesn’t just give up — they get to keep going until Inauguration Day. At that point, if the House delegations are still deadlocked, the vice president becomes president. Meanwhile, the vice president would likely be known. Since the Senate can only choose between the top two candidates (presumably Kaine and Pence), it would take a perfect tie for them to remain deadlocked. So here’s the rub: Whichever side loses in the Senate might have good reason to make a deal with a McMullin contingent in the House. That is, if Kaine is VP and the McMullin contingent holds fast, the party-loyal Republican coalition may be pressured to accept McMullin as better than Clinton (who would win if McMullin states sided with the Democrats) or Kaine (who would become president if the House remained deadlocked). While if Pence wins in the Senate, the Democrats may be pressured to accept McMullin rather than Trump or Pence — especially if they make deals for political appointments or legislative commitments. While this may sound shady by U.S. norms, it’s not unlike what happens in parliamentary systems around the world. The upshot, however, is a bit bizarre. If you’re pro-McMullin or anti-Trump enough that this scenario excites you, congrats. But unless you’re in Utah or other states come into play, there’s not much you can do about it. If McMullin cuts into the Trump vote enough to give Clinton plurality wins in potential red states, her victory is assured. In other words, if McMullin gets too strong, he could literally cost himself the election. The only route to the presidency McMullin can take must be navigated on the back of a dark horse. |||||Summary:","completion":"A new poll has revealed a potential upset in the US election, showing independent candidate Evan McMullin in a statistical tie with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - By the Sea is a 1915 film Charlie Chaplin made while waiting for a studio to work in Los Angeles .

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train[6] to Chicago, at 7:40 am. To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \\"on mission\\" to find the bomber before a large \\"dirty bomb\\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \\"Source Code\\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.[a] Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \\"with them\\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \\"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees. Stevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago.

Missing American found dead in Mexican mountains MEXICO CITY (AP) — Searchers on Friday found the body of an American man who had been missing in the rugged mountains in central Mexico since going on a hike four days ago. Carlos Mandujano, the civil defense coordinator for Morelos state, said a search team found the lifeless body of Hari Simran Singh Khalsa, 25. He was found in one of the narrow gorges or ravines that crisscross the rugged mountains in the colonial town of Tepoztlan, not far from where he was last seen in a picture of himself that he sent by cellphone. \\"He has been found, but unfortunately, dead,\\" Mandujano said. \\"We don't know the cause of death yet; that will be determined by the autopsy.\\" Khalsa's family and friends said in a statement later that he apparently died from a fall. \\"He appears to have fallen while hiking and sustained a fatal injury to the head,\\" it said. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City also confirmed the death. It said it was offering consular support to Khalsa's family and extended the U.S. government's condolences. While helicopters and hundreds of police and rescue workers combed the craggy mountains and cliffs around Tepoztlan this week, it appears Khalsa never went very far. The body \\"was in the same wooded area, but the thing is that it is very rough terrain,\\" Mandujano said. The search began Tuesday after Khalsa didn't return from going on a hike in Tepoztlan, about an hour south of Mexico City, with only a T-shirt, shorts, and little food and water, said his wife, Ad Purkh Kaur. Kaur said Friday from Tepoztlan that her husband was a yoga instructor born and raised in Brooklyn. The couple have been living in Leesburg, Virginia, but were planning to move back to Brooklyn at the end of the month. Kaur, whose legal name is Emily Smith, said she and her husband arrived in Tepoztlan for a yoga retreat Dec. 26. Tepoztlan, a frequent weekend getaway for Mexico City residents, is known for the towering, whimsically shaped cliffs and mountain peaks that tower over the colonial town on the valley floor. Kaur said she heard from her husband at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, when he sent a picture of himself on a mountain top pointing to the site of the yoga retreat, with the message: \\"Looking down on you!\\" She last heard from him about two hours after that, when he sent a text message. \\"I accidentally summited another mountain,\\" he wrote, Kaur said. \\"Looks like I'll be a little later coming back.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases is somewhat limited. There are some compounds whose properties suggest that they are either acidic or basic, but which do not qualify according to the Arrhenius definition. An example is ammonia (NH 3 ). Its aqueous solution turns litmus blue, it reacts with acids, and displays all the other properties of a base. However, it does not contain the hydroxide ion. In 1923, a broader definition of acids and bases was independently proposed by Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted (1879-1947) and English chemist Thomas Lowry (1874-1936). A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a molecule or ion that donates a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A Brønsted-Lowry base is a molecule or ion that accepts a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A hydrogen ion is commonly referred to as a proton, and so acids and bases are proton donors and proton acceptors respectively according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition. All substances that are categorized as acids and bases under the Arrhenius definition are also defined as such under the Brønsted-Lowry definition.

If I tell you that Gene segments are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do, and ask you the question \\"what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do?\\", is the correct answer \\"heat or cold\\"?","completion":"No, if you say that Gene segments are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do, the correct answer to the question \\"what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do?\\" would not be \\"heat or cold\\". Rather, the correct response should be \\"gene segments\\" or \\"genes\\" in broader terms. Let me explain this in more detail. In living organisms, the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains all the necessary genetic information required for the cells' development, functioning, and reproduction. DNA is made up of genes, which are the segments of DNA that code for specific proteins or have specific regulatory functions. Thus, genes are the units of heredity, conveying the necessary instructions for the development and functioning of cells and the whole organism. The genetic code is a set of rules that specify the correspondence between the nucleotide triplets called codons and the amino acids that make up proteins. When a cell needs a particular protein, a process called transcription occurs, which creates a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) as a temporary copy of the DNA gene. The mRNA then moves to the ribosomes in the cell – the protein-building factories – where a process called translation occurs. In this process, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined together to form proteins based on the sequence of mRNA. Consequently, each gene segment encodes specific instructions for assembling amino acids in the correct sequence, which ultimately determines the structure, function, and behavior of proteins. On the other hand, \\"heat or cold\\" refers to environmental factors that can influence cellular activities, such as metabolism or stress responses, but they do not directly encode instructions for cells. External factors, like temperature, can affect the rate of biochemical reactions within cells, including the processes of transcription, translation, and protein folding. However, the cell has multiple mechanisms in place to mitigate and respond to changes in temperature, including heat shock proteins, cold shock proteins, and other molecular chaperones that assist in protecting cellular proteins from denaturation or misfolding. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is \\"gene segments\\" or simply \\"genes.\\" These structures in DNA hold the essential information that controls cellular functions by encoding instructions for the creation of proteins. While environmental factors such as \\"heat or cold\\" may influence the cells' functions, they do not carry any direct instructions for the cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
