The air is crisp, the leaves are turning, and everyone's getting ready for Halloween. One of the most important traditions during this festive season is choosing the perfect pumpkin to bring home and adorn your doorstep. However, selecting the ideal pumpkin goes beyond just finding the right size and shape - you also want it to last throughout the season without rotting or fading. In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step process to ensure your pumpkin stays fresh and vibrant from day one. Step 1: Selecting a Pumpkin with a Long Stem The first step in preserving your pumpkin starts with the selection process. Look for a pumpkin with a long stem, as this can be indicative of a healthier and fresher pumpkin. Additionally, a longer stem can help reduce moisture loss and maintain the pumpkin's overall longevity. Step 2: Cleaning the Pumpkin with Soap and Water Once you've selected your pumpkin, it's essential to give it a thorough cleaning to remove any dirt, bacteria, or fungi that could accelerate decay. Using a mild soap and warm water, gently wash the entire surface of the pumpkin, taking special care around the stem area. Step 3: Wiping the Pumpkin Dry After ensuring your pumpkin is clean, use a soft cloth or paper towel to pat the entire surface dry. Be sure to completely dry the stem area, as any remaining moisture could promote rot and shorten the pumpkin's lifespan. Step 4: Spraying the Pumpkin with Rubbing Alcohol To further protect your pumpkin from early decay, apply a coat of rubbing alcohol to the surface. The rubbing alcohol acts as an antimicrobial agent, killing any remaining bacteria or fungi and reducing the chances of your pumpkin rotting. Step 5: Drying the Pumpkin Out over Several Weeks Before sealing the surface, it's critical to allow your pumpkin to air out and reach an ideal level of dryness. Place your pumpkin in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight, and allow it to sit for at least two weeks or until it feels lighter in weight. This process will help draw out excess moisture and slow down the decay process. Step 6: Sealing the Surface of the Pumpkin Finally, to ensure your pumpkin remains fresh and vibrant, apply a sealant to the surface of the pumpkin. You can use a commercial pumpkin sealant or create a homemade solution using a mixture of white glue and water. Apply a thin, even layer to the entire surface, ensuring the stem area is also covered. This will lock in the moisture that remains, preventing your pumpkin from drying out too much or becoming susceptible to decay. Conclusion: By following these simple steps, you'll be well on your way to preserving your perfect pumpkin throughout the Halloween season. Remember, selecting a pumpkin with a long stem and properly cleaning, drying, and sealing it will allow you and your family to enjoy the festive spirit without worrying about your pumpkin rotting away before the big night. Happy pumpkin picking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The dermis is the inner layer of skin. The dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings. The nerve endings explain why your skin is sensitive. You can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. You cut your finger and it starts to bleed. What has happened? If your skin bleeds, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged blood vessels. The cut really hurts. It hurts because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle. Hair passes up through the epidermis. It then extends above the skin surface. Oil glands produce an oily substance. The oil is secreted into hair follicles. Question: \\"Why do I bleed when I cut myself?\\" Response: \\"The dermis contains blood vessels that you damage when you cut yourself\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. When there is an incision or cut to the skin, if it's deep enough to penetrate through the epidermis (the outer layer of skin), it gets to the dermis, the second layer of skin, which contains blood vessels. These blood vessels are damaged by the cut, and so blood leaks out of them, causing the observed bleeding. In addition, your skin is sensitive and can sense pain due to the nerve endings present in the dermis layer. Hence, any cut or damage to this part of the skin will also be painful. The process of bleeding and the subsequent clotting forms part of the body's protective mechanism to prevent further injury as well as the invasion of harmful bacteria. Furthermore, the dermis contains other structures such as hair follicles and sebaceous (oil) glands. Hair follicles are the structures from which hair grows. The hair passes through the epidermis and goes beyond the skin surface. On the other hand, oil glands secrete an oily substance into the hair follicles. This oil not only moisturizes the skin and hair but also provides a layer of protection against harmful substances and microorganisms. However, it's critical to take necessary precautions to avoid deep cuts and, in case they happen, to deal with them appropriately. Caring for a deep cut often involves cleaning the wound, applying an antibiotic ointment, and covering it with a clean bandage. It's also important to watch for signs of infection such as increased pain, redness, or pus. In some cases, medical attention may be necessary, for instance, when the cut is too deep (it may require stitches to help it heal), when it's caused by a rusty or dirty object (there could be a risk of tetanus), or when it doesn't stop bleeding after applying pressure for about 10 to 15 minutes. Therefore, understanding the structure of the skin, particularly the dermis, and how it reacts to injuries helps us take better care of our health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria, especially wool, and a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network centred on Melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

On the other hand, the second sentence postulates that the school system has become tougher, causing even smart kids to struggle and fall behind. This implies that the educational standards and expectations have increased.

Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

The sight of blood had always caused her pulse to race and her stomach to churn, and sometimes she would even experience light-headedness or nausea, making the situation even more difficult for her to handle. Nevertheless, in this crucial moment, Kayla's overwhelming concern for her friend's well-being enabled her to push past her own fears and focus solely on providing aid to Emily. As Emily's nose continued to bleed, Kayla quickly scanned her surroundings for any helpful items, her hands trembling slightly from the anxiety she felt. As luck would have it, she spotted a first-aid kit nearby, and without a moment's hesitation, she retrieved it and opened it to find the necessary supplies. Grabbing a handful of clean gauze, she approached Emily, her heart pounding in her chest, making it difficult to breathe. She knew that she needed to stay calm in order to properly care for her friend, so Kayla took a few deep breaths, reminding herself that Emily was relying on her. With her thoughts focused on the task at hand, she felt slightly more at ease as she approached Emily and began to gently apply pressure to her friend's nostrils using the gauze. Recalling the first-aid techniques she had learned in her health class, she instructed Emily to lean forward slightly to help prevent blood from flowing into her throat. Kayla made sure to keep her voice steady, as she didn't want Emily to sense her fear. After a few minutes, she noticed the flow of blood starting to slow down, and her anxiety lessened as a result. Sensing that her friend was experiencing a sense of discomfort, Kayla spoke soothingly to Emily, distracting her from the pain and guiding her through breathing exercises that would help reduce her blood pressure. She urged Emily to gently blow her nose once to clear out any clotted blood, then had her pinch her nostrils together while breathing through her mouth for several minutes. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the bleeding stopped, and Emily was able to remove the gauze. Kayla was filled with relief, but she knew her responsibility as a caretaker wasn't over yet. She took the time to check if Emily felt lightheaded or too weak before advising her to keep her head elevated for a while and drink some water to prevent dehydration. In the end, Kayla had conquered her fear of blood, at least this once, in order to help her friend during a moment of crisis. The experience had taught her just how strong she could be when someone she cared about needed her, and it gave her a newfound sense of confidence in handling emergency situations. Kayla realized that her phobia, while still very real and scary, could be overcome when the situation demanded it. And although her fear of blood wasn't entirely vanquished that day, she knew that she had taken an important step towards facing her fears, allowing her to grow and become a more resilient individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Why do we remember Jawahar Lal Nehru for the defeat against China, but not for the victory against Portugal, for police action in the state of Hyderabad and Junagadh or for saving 3/4th of Kashmir with India? What is Article 370 of the Constitution of India? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first gather information about Jawahar Lal Nehru's role in the mentioned events, as well as Article 370 of the Constitution of India. Then, I will analyze the reasons why some of Nehru's actions are remembered differently. Finally, I will evaluate whether these questions are the same or not. Step 1: Gather Information Jawahar Lal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of independent India from 1947 to 1964. During his tenure, he faced various challenges, including the issues with China, Portugal, Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Kashmir. 1. Defeat against China: India faced a humiliating defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War under Nehru's leadership. This has left a lasting impression, and many Indians blame Nehru for India's unpreparedness and lack of military strategy. 2. Victory against Portugal: In 1961, India successfully annexed Goa, Daman and Diu, ending Portuguese colonial rule in the region. Nehru played a significant role in this event. 3. Police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh: Following India's independence, both Hyderabad and Junagadh acceded to India in 1948 after military intervention, often referred to as \\"police action.\\" This intervention led to the integration of these territories within the Indian Union. Nehru played a crucial role in these decisions. 4. Saving 3/4th of Kashmir: In 1947, when Pakistan-backed forces attempted to take control of Kashmir, Nehru took a timely decision to send Indian troops into the region, saving a significant portion of Kashmir from being occupied by Pakistan. Thus, a large part of Kashmir remained with India. 5. Article 370: It is a constitutional provision that granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag, and control over various administrative matters. The article was designed to respect the unique conditions and history of the region. It was abrogated in 2019. Step 2: Analyze Reasons for Differences in Remembrance 1. The defeat against China had a higher impact on the psyche of the Indian population than the other events. Losing a war to a neighboring nation, especially a growing superpower like China, tends to be remembered more prominently in public memory. 2. Successes such as the victory against Portugal or the police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh are sometimes overshadowed by failures. Portugal was a relatively weaker opponent compared to China, and integrating princely states into the Indian Union was a relatively smooth process compared to the territorial disputes with a major power like China. 3. The India-China conflict remains an ongoing issue, while the issues with Portugal, Hyderabad, and Junagadh have been resolved. This means that the 1962 defeat still resonates in the current political climate. Step 3: Evaluate if Questions are the Same These questions are not the same as they address different aspects of Jawahar Lal Nehru's political career and decisions. The first question is about the public perception of Nehru's actions in various territorial conflicts, while the second question asks about the specifics of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, both questions are related in that they pertain to different aspects of the history of modern India and the political decisions made during Nehru's tenure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I found the following answer on Google: The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid, heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled, the gravel is spread evenly over it. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the question on the lifespan of a flat membrane roof. To answer your original question, the lifespan of a flat membrane roof varies depending on the type of membrane material used, installation quality, and maintenance. There are different types of membrane materials commonly used for flat roofs, including: 1. TPO (Thermoplastic Olefin) - These roofs typically last around 22-30 years. 2. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) - PVC roofs have an estimated lifespan of 20-25 years. 3. EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) - EPDM rubber roofing systems can last around 20-25 years, with some lasting up to 30 years with proper maintenance. The longevity of a flat membrane roof depends on regular maintenance, inspections, and timely repairs. Additionally, various external factors, such as weather conditions, uv exposure, and mechanical damage, can impact the lifespan. To summarize, a flat membrane roof can last anywhere between 20-30 years, depending on the type of membrane material, installation quality, and maintenance practices. The answer you initially found discussed the installation process of a built-up roofing system (using tar and gravel), which is different from a single-ply membrane roofing system."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - birth date: 7 june 1942 - name: elizabeth counsell - birth place: windsor , berkshire , england - occupation: stage , film and television actress Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of elizabeth counsell .

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design? In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and The Jeff Beck Group. Cream, in songs like \\"I Feel Free\\" (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, The Jeff Beck Group. Dave Davies of The Kinks, Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of The Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion. The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and, with the track \\"Helter Skelter\\", attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear.

I can use this background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] Now, I have a new situation: Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.

And the answer is?","completion":"Sir John Sholto Douglas, the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, is most famously connected with the sport of boxing. Born on July 20, 1844, in Florence, Italy, Douglas had a long and varied career in British politics and sports. However, his most impactful and lasting contributions were in the realm of boxing, which made him an influential figure in the popularization and standardization of the sport. Douglas is best known for his role in the development of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which were first published in 1867 and are still used to govern modern boxing today. The rules, named after him, brought numerous significant changes and advancements to the sport, transforming it from a rather brutal and disorganized fighting style into a legitimate and structured sport. The Marquess of Queensberry Rules are a set of twelve guidelines that detail various aspects of boxing conduct, including the ring's dimensions, the proper use of gloves, the length of rounds, and what constituted a legal punch. These rules were instrumental in creating a safer and more standardized sport, eliminating some of the more hazardous and unsavory practices that had previously been associated with boxing. Some of the key components of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules are as follows: 1. The use of gloves: The rules required boxers to wear padded gloves to protect their hands and soften blows, reducing the risk of severe injury. 2. Three-minute rounds: Each round would last three minutes, with one-minute breaks between rounds. 3. Knockdowns: A fighter who was knocked down had ten seconds to regain their feet. Failure to do so resulted in a loss. 4. Fouls: The rules established what constituted a foul, such as striking below the belt, headbutting, or using elbows. Committing a foul could lead to disqualification. 5. No wrestling or grappling: Unlike earlier bare-knuckle fights, the Marquess of Queensberry Rules stated that boxing should be focused on striking, not wrestling or grappling. 6. Referee supervision: The rules established the role of a referee to enforce the regulations, ensure fair play and sportsmanship, and make decisions regarding fouls or other disputes that might arise during a match. In summary, Sir John Sholto Douglas, the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, is indelibly connected with the sport of boxing. Through his patronage and promotion of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, he played a pivotal role in transforming boxing into the organized and regulated sport it is today. His legacy within the sport is a testament to his lasting impact on boxing's continued growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are no special celebrations for these birthdays, but each is a time when a person can do new things to mark their transition into adulthood. After turning sixteen a person can work, get a driver's license and leave home. Many high school students learn to drive and get part-time jobs soon after celebrating their sixteenth birthday. At the age of eighteen a person in the United States can vote and smoke, but they are prohibited from going into nightclubs, buying wine or gambling until they are twenty-one. In many Latin cultures, a young woman's fifteenth birthday is important. At this age, she is regarded as an adult. To mark this special day, families with teenage daughters have a celebration called a Quinceanera. The day begins with the young woman and her family going to church. Later, there is a party and many guests are invited. In Japan, young people became adults at twenty. At this age, they can legally vote, drink wine and smoke. The second Monday in January is a national holiday called \\"Coming of Age Day\\". On this day, twenty-year-old celebrates by first going to church to pray with their families. Later, they listen to speeches given by city and school leaders. Afterward, they may celebrate with family or friends late into the night. In some countries, birthday celebrations continue through adulthood. Some people celebrate their fortieth and fiftieth birthdays, or their retirement year, with a huge party. In the United States, age sixteen marks the time when you can _ . A) vote and drive B) drive and get a job C) drink wine and smoke D) go into nightclubs A:","completion":"In the United States, age sixteen marks the time when you can drive and get a job (option B). Turning sixteen is often seen as a significant milestone in a person's life because it is associated with several new privileges and responsibilities. At this age, teenagers can legally apply for a driver's license, allowing them to operate a motor vehicle, giving them a newfound sense of independence and freedom. This can be very exciting for many teenagers since it means they no longer need to rely on their parents or public transportation to go to school, work, or social events. Additionally, at the age of sixteen, young people can start working and earning money in many states. This also adds to their sense of independence, as it allows them to contribute to their expenses, save money, or buy things that interest them. They can get part-time jobs, which can provide valuable work experience and help them develop a strong work ethic. Of course, the specific rules and regulations regarding employment may vary depending on the state they are in, but generally, sixteen-year-olds can engage in some form of legal employment. On the other hand, the other activities mentioned in the question (voting, drinking, smoking, and entering nightclubs) are reserved for older individuals. At the age of eighteen, a person gains the right to vote and smoke, while consuming alcohol and entering nightclubs are typically permitted only once they turn twenty-one. In summary, turning sixteen in the United States is associated with the ability to drive and get a job. This marks an important transitional period as young individuals start gaining independence and responsibility, setting the stage for their growth into adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with. Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good.

A: Answer:","completion":"d). mosses. A: Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for the phylum that consists solely of mosses. Mosses are small, non-vascular plants that belong to the division Bryophyta within the plant kingdom. These plants are characterized by their lack of roots, stems, and leaves, as well as their preference for damp, shady habitats. It is important to note that the term \\"Bryophyte\\" is often used informally to include not just mosses, but also liverworts (division Marchantiophyta) and hornworts (division Anthocerotophyta). However, in a formal taxonomic sense, Bryophyta refers only to mosses. There are approximately 12,000 species of mosses found worldwide, and they play a significant role in the ecology of various ecosystems. Mosses are primary producers, meaning they create their own food through photosynthesis, and they also serve as a source of water, shelter, and food for other organisms in their environment. Mosses reproduce both sexually and asexually, and they exhibit a two-phased life cycle called alternation of generations. The dominant, recognizable form of a moss is the gametophyte stage, which bears the reproductive structures called gametangia. The sporophyte stage, which produces spores through meiosis, is physically dependent on the gametophyte and is less conspicuous in most moss species. Some common examples of mosses include the peat moss (Sphagnum spp.), which plays a vital role in the formation of peat bogs and has important applications for humans, such as fuel, horticulture, and water filtration; and the haircap moss (Polytrichum spp.), which forms dense colonies on the ground in a variety of habitats. In summary, the formal taxonomic name for the phylum consisting solely of mosses is Bryophyta. These small, non-vascular plants are significant ecologically and can be found across the globe in various environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: - for a few hours - for a few minutes - not enough information - for a few days === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"for a few minutes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is night happens, how will it affect more water in the clouds freezes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To evaluate the perturbation hypothesis, we need to consider the effects of the \\"night\\" condition on the process of snowflake formation. Let's go step-by-step: 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: The temperature at higher altitudes (where clouds form) primarily depends on factors such as altitude itself, geographical location, and weather patterns, rather than the day-night cycle alone. However, night conditions may cause slightly lower temperatures compared to daytime, which could contribute to the water in the clouds becoming colder. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: As the water in the clouds becomes colder, it is more likely for ice crystals to form. As stated in step 1, night conditions could contribute to slightly lower temperatures, potentially leading to a higher likelihood of ice crystal formation. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: This process depends on the availability of water droplets and the temperature conditions in the cloud. If there are sufficient water droplets and the temperature is low enough, the ice crystals will continue to grow. Night conditions, with the potential for slightly lower temperatures, might influence this step somewhat indirectly, but the primary factors remain the overall atmospheric conditions in the cloud. 4. Ice crystals form snowflakes: The growth of ice crystals leads to the formation of snowflakes. The direct relation between night conditions and this process is minimal, as it is primarily influenced by the temperature and crystal growth conditions in the cloud, regardless of the time of day. 5. Snowflakes fall to the ground: The falling of snowflakes is influenced by factors such as the weight of the snowflakes, air currents, and temperature variations between the cloud and ground levels. Night conditions do not have a direct influence on this process, as the primary driving factors are based on the overall atmospheric conditions, rather than the time of day. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of \\"night\\" conditions may have a minimal indirect effect on the snowflake formation process, primarily due to the potential for slightly lower temperatures at night, which can contribute to water in the clouds becoming colder and promote the formation of ice crystals. However, it is important to note that the process of snowflake formation relies heavily on the overall atmospheric conditions, so the night conditions alone do not determine the outcome of this process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, if the firearm is displayed in a manner \`\`calculated to cause alarm,'' then it is \`\`disorderly conduct''. Open carry of a handgun in public had long been illegal in Texas, except when the carrier was on property he/she owned or had lawful control over, was legally hunting, or was participating in some gun-related public event such as a gun show. However, the 2015 Texas Legislature passed a bill to allow concealed handgun permit holders to begin carrying handguns openly. The bill was signed into law on June 13, 2015, and took effect on January 1, 2016. A License to Carry (LTC) is still required to carry a handgun openly or concealed in public.","completion":"Yes, based on the text provided, it is true that you can carry a gun in Texas without a license under certain circumstances and conditions. However, there are specific rules and limitations regarding both the type of firearm and the manner in which it is carried. Firstly, the text explains that there is no legal statute prohibiting the carry of a firearm other than a handgun. This means that carrying firearms like pre-1899 black powder weapons and their replicas are not considered illegal in Texas, as they are not categorized as firearms under Texas law. However, there are some restrictions when carrying firearms in public. If a firearm is displayed in a manner that is \\"calculated to cause alarm,\\" this would be considered \\"disorderly conduct\\" and is not allowed. Regarding open carry of handguns in public, Texas law has undergone changes in recent years. Historically, it was illegal to have an openly carried handgun in public except for when the carrier was on property they owned or had legal control over, they were legally hunting, or they were participating in certain gun-related public events such as gun shows. In 2015, the Texas Legislature passed a bill allowing concealed handgun permit holders to carry handguns openly. The bill was signed into law on June 13, 2015, and came into effect on January 1, 2016. However, it is important to note that a License to Carry (LTC) is still required to carry a handgun openly or concealed in public in Texas. This means that, despite the changes in the law, a license is still necessary for carrying a handgun in public, whether it is carried openly or concealed. In summary, based on the provided text, it is true that you can carry certain firearms in Texas without a license, but there are specific limitations depending on the type of firearm and the manner in which it is carried. Open or concealed carry of handguns in public still requires a License to Carry (LTC) in Texas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics.

They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP. In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor.

In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later.

Write an article with the title: \\"World Cup turns sour for African teams, vuvuzelas prove unpopular\\"","completion":"Step 1: Begin with an engaging introduction that provides context about the World Cup and African teams' performance in it, and introduces the unpopularity of vuvuzelas. Title: World Cup Turns Sour for African Teams, Vuvuzelas Prove Unpopular Introduction: The FIFA World Cup represents a festivity of diverse cultures and a celebration of the beautiful game of football across the globe. However, the dream for African teams to shine on the international stage has turned into a bitter disappointment at this year's tournament. With traditionally strong African contenders like Nigeria and Cameroon already knocked out, their fans are left to rue their misfortunes. Amidst this disappointment, even the highly-anticipated and culturally iconic vuvuzelas have lost their charm among football enthusiasts. Step 2: Discuss the performance of African teams in the tournament, including their strengths and weaknesses. African Teams' Performance: The hopes of African teams had been high prior to the tournament, with young and talented players emerging and experienced veterans forming the backbone of the squads. Yet, despite their potentials, a series of unfavorable results, underwhelming performances, and sometimes controversial decisions have conspired against their success. Ivory Coast, for example, saw their chances shattered by a last-minute penalty awarded to their opponents, while Senegal missed out on the knockout stage due to FIFA's fair-play rule. Collectively, these incidents not only mark a setback for African football, but also cast a shadow over the prospects of future World Cups. Step 3: Address the decline in popularity of vuvuzelas and give reasons for the discontent. Vuvuzelas Lose their Appeal: For many, the distinct buzzing sound of the vuvuzela had once been synonymous with passionate African football fandom. However, the instrument has now become an irritant to fans and players alike. Several factors appear to be contributing to this decline in popularity, one of which is simply the annoyance caused by their continuous noise. Complaints amongst fans indicate that the sound produced by vuvuzelas tends to drown out chants, songs, and conversations that would typically enrich the stadium atmosphere. Additionally, medical experts have highlighted the possible harm these horns can inflict on individuals' hearing. The prolonged exposure to the high-intensity noise generated by vuvuzelas can result in temporary and even permanent hearing loss. This revelation has led to a decline in their usage, as the once vibrant symbol of African football slowly fades into memory. Step 4: Conclude the article by emphasizing the current situation and future expectations for African football and the fate of vuvuzelas. Conclusion: As the World Cup continues without the presence of fan-favorite African teams, their supporters are left with a sense of dismay and dejection. This, coupled with the growing unpopularity of the once-celebrated vuvuzelas, only adds to the cumulative sense of disappointment surrounding this year's tournament. However, the resilience and spirit of African football offers hope that both the teams and their fans will learn from this adversity and return stronger in future World Cup campaigns. It remains to be seen whether the same can be said for the vuvuzelas, or if their decline signifies the end of an era for this once ubiquitous symbol of African football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As workers at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant continue to fight off a nuclear meltdown, G-7 countries have united to help stave off economic disaster. The group of seven industrialized countries agreed to intervene in currency markets for the first time in more than a decade to prevent the yen from rising further after it hit a record high earlier this week. In a statement released by the European Central Bank, the G-7 said its actions were \\"at the request of the Japanese authorities,\\" adding that \\" .\\" Japan's central bank has pledged to adopt strategies for \\"powerful monetary easing.\\" Exporters benefited from the decline in the yen. Lower yen valuations increase the amount companies earn selling merchandise abroad, since they end up with more yen once they repatriate profits. Daikin Industries, a major exporter of air conditioners, rallied 8.7%. The company has numerous plants and service centers doing business in locations ranging from Osaka to Thailand to Shanghai, which were not all affected by the earthquake and tsunami.

Translate to English","completion":"Can investment be a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program? Investment can undoubtedly be a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program. Aid for Trade is an initiative launched by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005, aimed at helping developing countries better integrate into the global trading system, build trade capacity, and support economic growth. As such, investment can play a crucial role in achieving these objectives and contribute to the success of the Aid for Trade program. Below are some reasons why investment is essential for this program: 1. Infrastructure development: A critical aspect of increasing trade capacity and competitiveness in developing countries is improving their infrastructure. Investment in transportation, communication, and energy sectors can significantly enhance a country's ability to integrate with global markets, reduce trade costs, and increase exports. These improvements can result from investments made by both the private and public sectors, including foreign direct investments (FDI) and public-private partnerships (PPP). 2. Access to finance: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are crucial players in developing countries' trade and economic growth. However, they often face difficulties accessing affordable finance to expand their businesses or penetrate foreign markets. Investment funds or concessional loans from development banks or institutions can increase their access to finance and boost trade activities. 3. Technology transfer and innovation: Investment can facilitate the transfer of technology and know-how between developed and developing countries. This technology transfer can lead to the adoption of new production methods, increased productivity, and the ability to produce higher-value goods and services. Investing in innovation and research and development (R&D) programs can also support the creation of new products or the improvement of existing ones, increasing a country's competitiveness on the global stage. 4. Employment generation and skills development: Investment can foster job creation and contribute to poverty reduction, especially when it is directed toward sectors with high labor-intensity. Moreover, indirect employment effects of investment can lead to positive spillovers in the local economy. Investing in education and skills development can enhance the human capital of developing countries, improve employability in higher-value sectors, and support sustainable development. 5. Attraction of additional resources: Investment can act as a catalyst to mobilize additional financial resources and attract further investments. By demonstrating their commitment to developing countries through Aid for Trade investments, donor countries can encourage other international actors and the private sector to get involved and contribute to the development process. In turn, this can increase support and funding for a wide range of trade-related projects and initiatives. In summary, investment is undoubtedly a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program, as it can contribute to infrastructure development, better access to finance, technology transfer and innovation, employment generation, and skills development. By carefully targeting and coordinating investments, Aid for Trade can maximize its impact and help developing countries better integrate into the global trading system and promote sustainable economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. Incorrect product shipped: The reviewer clearly states that they received the wrong product (a Motorola Rocker BT50 cell phone battery) instead of the Jabra BT8010 Bluetooth Mono/Stereo Headset with the attachable speaker. This indicates a lack of quality control or possible errors in the shipping process, which would be a concern for any potential buyer. 2. Inaccurate product description and image: The reviewer mentions that the product description on the page is incorrect, and the image shows the battery that they received instead of the headset. This casts doubt on the accuracy of the information provided for the product and makes it difficult for potential buyers to trust the listing. 3. Wasted time and effort: The reviewer had to go through the hassle of returning the incorrect product and ultimately had to purchase the desired headset from another seller. This experience demonstrates possible inefficiencies or communication breakdowns within the seller's operations, leading to a negative customer experience. 4. Unresolved issue: The reviewer states that they do not know why Amazon has not corrected the error, suggesting that the issue may still be present at the time of reading the review. This further discourages potential buyers from taking the risk of purchasing the product, as they may be concerned about encountering the same problems.

Hotels: a Much Higher Minimum Wage Nine months into a minimum wage hike at some Los Angeles hotels, city leaders and other backers of the move are claiming victory, saying doomsday forecasts from hoteliers have proven unfounded. Confined to about 15 of the city’s largest non-union hotels and accounting for more than a fifth of all its hotel rooms, the increase was aimed at the segment of the service economy that city leaders saw as best equipped to absorb the extra cost. Hoteliers say full data are not yet in and some layoffs have taken place, but champions of the raise say that the naysayers’ concerns appear to have been overblown. “There have not been the wholesale layoffs or cutbacks that we were told would occur,” said Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price, who co-authored the wage hike ordinance. The pay rise for a small slice of an industry gives an early if limited glimpse into the drive for a 15 minimum wage, gathering pace in states from New York to the West Coast. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at 7.25/hour since 2009. A phased statewide raise to 15, ultimately affecting 5.6 million workers, was approved by the California legislature last week and Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, is expected to sign it into law on Monday. Oregon Passes a Law Giving It the Nation’s Highest Minimum Wage Pushing wages to just over 15 from as low as 9 an hour for an estimated 3,000 hotel workers began last summer as the first phase of a hike for the second-largest U.S. city, largely run by Democrats. It affects about 8,000 rooms, or half of Los Angeles’ large-hotel room inventory. Hotel operators had warned the hike would force them to cut staff and services, put the brakes on new hotel projects and would drive away customers. Because of the increase, Julie Robey, a general manager at the Holiday Inn IHG Los Angeles Gateway, south of downtown, said she had to lay off seven employees, cutting her staff to 95 full and part-time workers. Robert Amano, executive director of the Hotel Association of Los Angeles, which opposed the increase, said the hike has led to some job cuts, but that an overall tally is not available. Many hotels have chosen to absorb the increase by upping restaurant food prices by 15 to 30%, he said. And he warned that smaller hotels, which do not have the same profit cushion, could face bigger challenges when they have to implement the increase this summer. For more on hotels, watch our video: Raising the minimum wage is a key issue for contenders in the November U.S. presidential election, addressing a movement led by labor unions to provide better living standards for the working poor. Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are avid supporters. Republican front-runner and businessman Donald Trump, who owns hotels, has said U.S. wages in general are too low—but also that it is not necessarily bad to have a low minimum wage in order to compete in a global marketplace. L.A. city leaders appear to have picked the right moment for their experiment. An improving economy has helped buoy L.A. hotel occupancy rates to an all-time high, blunting the effect of the wage rise on the bottom line, hotel industry officials said. “When demand is high and you’re running busy, you don’t want to cut staff,” Amano said. More than two dozen new hotel projects are in the works, the biggest hotel development boom in Los Angeles since the 1980s, said Bruce Baltin, senior vice president at PKF Consulting, which provides analysis to the hotel industry. “Fortunately, the industry in Los Angeles is very healthy right now,” Baltin said.

We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned. As Thomas Edison said, \\"I am not discouraged, because every abandoned wrong attempt is another step forward. \\" Furthermore, we often make mistakes because we try new things-we wander away from accepted paths.

To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. Question: Why did the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so? Options: A. because there was no password B. because the agent walked to the car C. because the car started D. not enough information The answer is:","completion":"C. because the car started The dash light and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so because the car started. In the context provided, it was described that after the agent manipulated the Ford app on her phone, there was a cut to the car's interior where the dash lights lit up. Typically in vehicles, when the car engine is started, the dashboard lights up as part of its system check and to provide relevant information to the driver. This includes details about the vehicle's speed, fuel level, engine temperature and functionalities of other car systems. In this scene, the dashboard illumination was used as a visual cue to indicate that the car's engine was started remotely using the Ford app by the agent. This entire sequence is heavily suggestive of product placement for Ford, particularly showcasing the Ford app's remote start feature. However, it doesn't seem to contribute much to the plot of the episode, as per the provided context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A man accused of beheading a Topeka resident with a guitar string has pleaded innocent to premeditated first-degree murder. Police say 29-year-old James Paul Harris practiced voodoo and kept the head of 49-year-old James Gerety to talk to after the March or April 2011 killing. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Gerety's partial remains were found a year later in Carbondale, 18 miles south of Topeka. Decapitation charge: James Paul Harris, left, is escorted from the Osage County Courthouse in Lyndon, Kansas last month for a court appearance after being accused of beheading James Gerety with a guitar string three years ago. Harris' former girlfriend testified in March that he told her he used a guitar string to sever Gerety's head. She said he disposed of the body but kept the head in a bag. A Topeka police officer said the ex-girlfriend told him Harris practiced voodoo and that he liked to talk to the head. A judge on Monday set Harris' trial for June 23. Thomas Henderson, an attorney who handled Gerety's Social Security. payments, testified at the March hearing that he reported Gerety missing. in April 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments. Henderson said. Gerety planned to live with Harris in Carbondale, 18 miles south of. Topeka. Dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, Harris appeared in court under heavy guard for the 30 minute hearing - six Osage County sheriff deputies watched him sat with his two attorneys. He is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder of James Gerety, who authorities believe was killed between March 3, 2011 and April 20, 2011. On March 14 in a pre-trial hearing, former girlfriend, Bobbie Williams testified that Harris told her he killed Gerety using a guitar string, disposed of the body, but kept the head in a bag for himself. Murdered: Harris is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder in the death of James Gerety, (pictured) who died in March or April of 2011. Another witness at that hearing, Topeka police Detective Brian Hill said that during questioning after his arrest, Harris told him that he kept the victim's head in a canvas bag with a draw string. Hill testified that Harris spoke to the head, and had an active interest in voodoo and practiced it. According to Harris' former girlfriend, Harris told her that he had shot the victim in the stomach and then tortured him for two days at their Topeka house. After he had finished with his brutal treatment of Gerety, Harris then decapitated him with the string, according to Williams' testimony. Then, Harris is said to have put Gerety's torso, arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father, Jeff Harris in Osage County. Harris' girlfriend testified in March that he said he severed Gerety's head with a guitar string. A Topeka police officer testified that he was told Harris kept the head so he could talk to it as part of a voodoo ritual. Williams testified in court that she saw Gerety's head once, but then claimed later on that she was mistaken. She did tell the court that Harris kept a voodoo doll named 'Jimbo', 'Bob on the Hill' and 'Poor Jimbo Bolinsky'. The doll hung from the ceiling in their apartment. Gerety's skull was recovered on March 24, 2012, at Jeff Harris' home by his girlfriend, Shirley Johnson. She had been on the hunt for mushrooms when she found a ball barely buried and brought it inside to show Harris' father, who promptly called the police and his son was arrested. Harris was in federal custody on unrelated charges when a warrant was. issued in October 2013 and he was placed on hold for Kansas authorities. In January, Harris filed a request to have the hold resolved and he was. booked into the Osage County jail in March for court proceedings.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 262*w - 136*w - 10 = 128*w for w.","completion":"To solve this math problem, we need to find the value of 'w' which satisfies the equation 262w - 136w - 10 = 128w. 1. First, let's combine the terms with 'w' on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two terms with 'w': 262w and -136w. Combining them, we get: 262w - 136w = 126w So the equation becomes: 126w - 10 = 128w 2. Now, we want to get all the terms with 'w' on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. To do this, we can subtract 126w from both sides of the equation: 128w - 126w = 10 Simplifying this expression, we get: 2w = 10 3. Finally, to solve for 'w', we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 2w / 2 = 10 / 2 w = 5 So, the solution to this math problem is w = 5. When w = 5, the equation 262w - 136w - 10 = 128w holds true."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What key details about harold a. ackerman can be extracted from the following bio?

These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer. Question: Who created the relay computer, the Z2?","completion":"The Z2, one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer, was created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939. Konrad Zuse was a visionary inventor who played an essential role in the development of early computers. Born on June 22, 1910, in Berlin, Germany, Zuse studied civil engineering at the Technical University of Berlin-Charlottenburg and later became a pioneer in the field of computer engineering. The Z2 was Zuse's second attempt at developing a computing machine, following the Z1, which he built in his parents’ living room from 1936 to 1938. As an electromechanical device, the Z2 used electric switches and mechanical relays to process calculations. Although these machines had relatively low operating speeds, they laid the foundation for the development of more advanced computing technology. The Z2 specifically served as a prototype for Zuse's later inventions, such as the Z3 and Z4. Electromechanical relay computers, including the Z2, were eventually replaced by faster all-electric devices that initially used vacuum tubes, and later, transistors. The transition to all-electric computing began in the mid-20th century, and this evolution enabled the production of modern electronic computers that could perform calculations at much higher speeds. Notable examples of this shift in technology include the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), developed in the United States during World War II, and the Colossus, a codebreaking machine created by British engineer Tommy Flowers. In summary, German engineer Konrad Zuse created the electromechanical relay computer, the Z2, in 1939. This invention was influential in the early development of computer technology and served as a prototype for more advanced machines. Although the Z2 had a low operating speed, it was a crucial stepping stone towards the creation of all-electric computers that now form the basis of modern computing systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhall) arrives at the Genesis House, a way station for women who have recently been paroled from prison. A recovering heroin addict, she has just completed a three-year sentence for robbery to support her addiction. Although she has her own private room, she has chores she must perform and must share a pay phone with the other residents.Accustomed to using sex to get what she wants, she quickly seduces Andy (Rio Hackford), who manages the house. She also performs oral sex on her job placement counselor so he will get her the job she wants working in a daycare center. Sherry struggles with wanting to use again, and befriends Dean (Danny Trejo), a fellow recovery group member who remembers her from a bar she used to frequent when she was underage.She wants to be a good mother to her daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who has been cared for by Sherry's brother, Bobby (Brad Henke), and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Alexis is confused about her mother's return, a situation that is not helped by Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and insistence that Alexis call her mother and Sherry by her first name.Sherry gets into conflict with another woman at Genesis and moves in with Bobby and Lynette. When her father (Sam Bottoms) and his wife come for a visit, Sherry tries to impress everyone by singing \\"Eternal Flame,\\" but the family is clearly more interested in Alexis and uncomfortable around Sherry. Alexis tells Sherry that Lynette doesn't want her to call Sherry mother, and Alexis and Lynette fight. Bobby takes Sherry to a motel. The next day, when Sherry reports to her parole officer, Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito), he threatens to send her back to prison because she did not go through proper channels to leave Genesis. When a search doesn't turn up any drugs, Hernandez reveals she has a job at a local Catholic day care center.After completing her first day at the center, she goes to visit Dean, with whom she has begun a sexual relationship.

Answer:","completion":"Considering Sherry Swanson's journey in the movie, the challenges she faces in adjusting to life post-prison, rebuilding relationships, and her struggle with addiction, a suitable question about the movie plot would be: How does Sherry's journey in the movie serve as a portrayal of the difficulties ex-convicts face in reintegrating into society, and what lessons can be learned from her attempts to overcome her past and build a stable future for herself and her daughter? In this movie plot, we see Sherry navigating a new life post-incarceration and grappling with a variety of challenges, including finding work, fitting into a halfway house, repairing relationships with her family, and resisting the urge to fall back into old habits and coping mechanisms. Her interactions with other characters, such as her brother Bobby, sister-in-law Lynette, daughter Alexis, and parole officer Hernandez, demonstrate the barriers ex-convicts often face when trying to rebuild their lives. Sherry's experience highlights the importance of addressing addiction and mental health among individuals who have been incarcerated, as well as providing adequate support systems to ensure successful reintegration into society. Additionally, the movie plot showcases the complexities involved in rebuilding relationships and trust with loved ones after an extended absence. In Sherry's case, her longing to be a good mother to Alexis is complicated not only by her own past behavior but also by the opinions and choices of those now caring for her daughter. Furthermore, the movie plot emphasizes the impact of societal perspectives on ex-convicts and the significance of overcoming personal barriers and stigma when seeking employment and building new relationships. For example, Sherry's seduction of her job placement counselor can be interpreted as a reflection of her desperation to secure a job after her release, as well as her continued reliance on unhealthy behaviors to achieve her goals. Similarly, Sherry's relationship with Dean is a mixture of seeking support from a fellow recovering addict while also engaging in potentially risky behaviors that could jeopardize her progress. In conclusion, by exploring the question of how Sherry's journey serves as a portrayal of the difficulties faced by ex-convicts in reintegrating into society, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding post-incarceration adjustments and the importance of providing support, guidance, and opportunities for individuals like Sherry to overcome their past and forge a better future for themselves and their loved ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others.

Use this fact to answer the question: a pulley is used for lifting objects A pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole by","completion":"1. Attaching the flag to a rope: The first step in using the pulley system is to attach the flag to the rope. To do this, I would connect the grommets (small metal rings) of the flag to the appropriate hooks or clips on the rope. This ensures that the flag remains secure when being lifted. 2. Ensuring the pulley is in place: To make sure the pulley is properly positioned, I would inspect the top of the flagpole to find the pulley system. The pulley should be securely fastened to the top of the flagpole, with the rope running through the wheel-like mechanism. This allows the rope to move smoothly when lifting the flag. 3. Feeding the rope through the pulley: Next, I would ensure that the rope is properly threaded through the pulley. The rope should run from the flag, up to the pulley at the top of the flagpole, and then back down to the person operating the pulley. This helps to create a mechanical advantage that makes lifting the flag easier. 4. Pulling the rope to raise the flag: With the flag securely attached to the rope and the rope properly threaded through the pulley, I would then begin to pull the loose end of the rope downward. As I pull the rope, the pulley system will use its mechanical advantage to lift the flag up the flagpole. 5. Securing the rope when the flag is raised: Once the flag has been lifted to the desired height, I would need to ensure that the rope is secured to prevent the flag from slipping down the flagpole. To do this, I would tie the rope around a cleat or other suitable fixture at the base of the flagpole. 6. Checking the flag's position: Finally, after securing the rope, I would inspect the position of the flag to ensure that it is flying properly, not tangled, and fully visible. If necessary, I would make adjustments to the flag's position by gently pulling on the rope and re-securing it. In summary, to lift a flag on a flagpole using a pulley, I would attach the flag to the rope, ensure the pulley system is in place, properly feed the rope through the pulley, pull the rope to raise the flag, secure the rope at the desired height, and check the flag's position for proper display."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We split into groups and ventured out with members of the Crusade team from Mexico City . Although I am studying Spanish , the language barrier was disheartening . Not being able to even have a conversation with a person nearby was hard . Question: What type of religious faith is the narrator ?","completion":"Based on the information given in the text, it is not explicitly stated which specific religious faith the narrator follows. However, the text does provide enough information about the narrator's activities and objectives to make an educated guess about their religious affiliation. The narrator mentions that they have been spending time on various campuses, meeting students, and seeking potential believers who they'd want to start a spiritual movement. Additionally, they mention that they worked together with members of the \\"Crusade team from Mexico City,\\" and this might imply that their religious faith is Christianity. The term \\"Crusade\\" is historically associated with Christianity, as it refers to the series of religious and military campaigns undertaken by the Christian powers of Europe against Muslims and others during the High Middle Ages. The narrator's goal of finding believers and initiating a spiritual movement on various campuses aligns with the teachings and goals of Christianity, which emphasizes spreading the faith and introducing new people to its teachings. With all of this information, it can be reasonably inferred that the narrator probably adheres to Christianity or a denomination within it. It's important to remember that this is an educated guess based on the available information and there is still room for interpretation. Christianity is a diverse faith with many denominations and belief systems under its umbrella, and the text does not provide specific details that would allow for a more precise identification of the narrator's exact religious affiliation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It took less than 24 hours for Stuart Lancaster’s cautious optimism about the fitness of his players to be dimmed after it emerged that Joe Launchbury will miss next year’s RBS 6 Nations following spinal surgery. The 23-year-old lock, a pivotal member of the England squad when fit, must have his operation on Friday to correct the nerve problem in his neck which has caused discomfort for several months. Launchbury missed the autumn internationals and had hoped a period of extended rest would cure the debilitating injury. But Wasps director of rugby Dai Young revealed on Sunday that this recovery was behind schedule, raising the spectre of surgery. Joe Launchbury (right, in action against New Zealand in July) will undergo neck surgery on Friday. Lunchbury's injury is understood to be similar to the one sustained by Dan Cole last season. Launchbury will miss England's Six Nations campaign in a blow to Stuart Lancaster. Those fears were confirmed on Thursday when Wasps announced the 20-cap star will have a ‘routine decompression’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc which has caused him to lose power in his arm. Young said: ‘As you would expect, this is a frustrating time for Joe, but the most important thing in all of this isn’t rugby, it’s Joe’s long-term health. We have consulted specialists in this field and they have recommended surgery as the best option to get him back to full fitness for the long term. ‘Joe is in good hands. He is being looked after by one of the world’s leading surgeons and he will have the full support of the Wasps and England medical teams during his rehabilitation period.’ Launchbury’s recovery is expected to take between three and four months, making it is possible he will not play again this season. The news came a day after Lancaster learned of Lions prop Alex Corbisiero’s imminent return to action for Northampton. The 20-cap star will have a ‘routine decompression’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc. Launchbury has not played for Wasps since November due to his neck problem. Chris Robshaw: captain out for four weeks with ‘stinger’ shoulder injury. Joe Launchbury: out for up to four months with neck surgery pending. Brad Barritt: lengthy lay-off with calf injury. Ed Slater: lucky if he plays this season (knee). Tom Croft: horrendous run of injuries with setback after setback. Tom Johnson: neck injury is keeping him sidelined. Manu Tuilagi: groin injury proving hard to shake off. Will Fraser: back injury causing Saracen problems. Recently returned: Geoff Parling (concussion), Mako Vunipola (back, knee), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Dan Cole (neck surgery). Back soon: Alex Corbisiero (shoulder surgery). Launchbury’s injury — understood to be similar to the one suffered last season by England prop Dan Cole — raises more questions about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugby’s top stars. Some believe those most proficient at ‘jackling’ for possession over the ball are especially vulnerable because their necks are exposed at the breakdown. Another injury causing concern — concussion — looks to have also ruled Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton out of action until at least February. The Racing Metro star has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November and French newspaper L’Equipe reported on Thursday that he has been suffering headaches and nausea ever since. After consulting a neurologist, it has been decided Sexton — who was also knocked unconscious in last season’s final Six Nations clash against France and was sidelined for several weeks — should not play until February 14 at the earliest. That makes the Lions No 10 certain to miss Ireland’s opening game against Italy but with such a notoriously difficult injury to asses, there are fears Sexton could be out for even longer. Racing coach Laurent Labit said: ‘As long as Jonny Sexton doesn’t feel 100 per cent, we cannot take any risks.’ Sexton has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November. It has been reported that Sexton will be able to take part in non-contact training, although strict return-to-play protocols say a player can only return to non-contact training 24 hours after becoming symptom free. Sexton has struggled to settle at Racing following his move to Paris last summer and will return to Leinster at the end of this season, with New Zealand’s world-record points scorer Dan Carter confirmed yesterday as his replacement. Carter — who will earn close to £800,000 a year — predicts the move will be an ‘awesome experience’, while Racing’s millionaire owner Jacky Lorenzetti denies the 33-year-old’s wages are excessive because of his enormous marketing potential. ‘Carter will be the best-paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits,’ Lorenzetti said. Meanwhile, European champions Toulon are considering suing the two Leicester Tigers supporters whose testimony led to Delon Armitage receiving a three-month ban on Wednesday. Sexton looks certain to miss Ireland's Six Nations opener against Italy, but is in danger of missing even more. Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was incensed by the length of the ban, imposed after a three-man disciplinary panel found the former England full back guilty of verbally abusing fans following Toulon’s European Cup defeat at Welford Road 12 days ago. ‘We aren’t discounting the eventuality of going after these two supporters in court for false testimonies,’ said Boudjellal. ‘This is an extraordinary decision which rests only on the allegations of two opposition supporters, whose objectivity we can legitimately put in doubt. ‘There is no formal proof, no official document, not even television pictures, to attest to the veracity of these testimonies.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Joe Launchbury will miss the RBS 6 Nations Championship following spinal surgery to correct a nerve problem in his neck. 2. His recovery is expected to take between three and four months, possibly ruling him out for the entire season. 3. Launchbury's injury raises concerns about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugby's top players. 4.

What is the name of the heroine in Steig Larsson's Millennium Trilogy?","completion":"The name of the heroine in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is Lisbeth Salander, a complex and highly skilled protagonist in the series. The Millennium Series consists of three novels: \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\". The series was published posthumously after Larsson's death in 2004. Lisbeth Salander is portrayed as an unconventional and intelligent investigator and computer hacker who possesses prodigious skills in problem-solving, cryptography, and information gathering. Salander is also depicted as having a traumatic past, which contributes to her character's development and her interactions with the different characters in the series. Her partnering with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist forms the core of the series, as the duo work together to solve multiple cases and unveil the dark secrets, conspiracies, and corruption they encounter along the way. Throughout the series, Lisbeth's character develops in fascinating ways as we witness her cooperation with Blomkvist and her confrontations with adversaries. The first book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", begins with Salander helping Blomkvist work on a case involving a family with hidden secrets and a decades-long unsolved disappearance. As the two work together, they uncover a series of gruesome crimes. In \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", Lisbeth becomes the target of an intense police investigation after being accused of murder, forcing her to dive into her past to prove her innocence. The third book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\", ties up the loose ends of Lisbeth's tumultuous past and her struggle against the criminal masterminds who have tormented her throughout her life. While Stieg Larsson originally planned for the series to span ten books, his untimely death left the future of the series uncertain. Eventually, Swedish author David Lagercrantz took over, adding three more novels to the series: \\"The Girl in the Spider's Web\\", \\"The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\\", and \\"The Girl Who Lived Twice\\". In these novels, Lisbeth Salander continues to feature as the prominent protagonist, and her character development continues to evolve. Larsson's Millennium Series gained immense popularity worldwide, and its cinematic adaptations received critical acclamation and box office success, both in Sweden and the United States. Lisbeth Salander's character has become iconic, and her portrayal as a strong, resilient, and brilliant underdog has resonated with readers and audiences alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: (1). mass (2). weight (3). size (4). volume","completion":"The term for the amount of space taken up by an object is (4). volume. Volume refers to the three-dimensional space occupied by an object and is typically measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic meters (m³). Volume is an important property of an object or substance, as it quantifies the space that an object occupies or the amount of substance present in a particular container. In contrast, the other terms mentioned in your list have different meanings: (1). Mass refers to the amount of matter in an object, irrespective of the space that it occupies. Mass is commonly measured in units such as grams (g) or kilograms (kg). It is an intrinsic property of an object, which means its mass remains constant regardless of its location or the environmental conditions that it experiences. (2). Weight refers to the force exerted on an object due to gravity and is directly proportional to its mass. The weight of an object depends on the local gravitational field strength, so it varies at different locations on Earth or in space. Weight is commonly measured in units such as newtons (N) or pounds (lbs). Thus, unlike mass, the weight of an object is not an intrinsic property, as it depends on external factors. (3). Size refers to the physical dimensions of an object, for example, its length, width, or height. Size can be measured in various units, such as meters (m), inches (in), or feet (ft), depending on the dimensions being considered. While the size of an object is related to the space it occupies, it does not directly indicate the actual volume of the object, as the latter involves the calculations of all three dimensions together. So, out of the given options, the appropriate term for the amount of space taken up by an object is volume. Volume serves as a useful property to characterize and compare different objects or substances, especially in applications related to storage and transportation, as well as in scientific calculations pertinent to chemistry and physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Sulla's second civil war was one of a series of civil wars of ancient Rome. It was fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius the younger in 82 BC. Prelude. Sulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to Africa through his first march on Rome, but departed soon afterwards to lead the First Mithridatic War. This departure allowed Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the younger to return to Rome with an army and, with Lucius Cornelius Cinna, to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter Gnaeus Octavius during Sulla's absence. Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius. Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers. All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered. Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC. Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome. - Consul (abbrev. \\"cos.\\"; Latin plural \\"consules\\") was the title of one of the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the Roman Empire. The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The relating adjective is consular, from the \\"consularis\\". - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. - The Third Mithridatic War (7363 BC) was the last and longest of three Mithridatic Wars and was fought between Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was joined by his allies, and the Roman Republic. The war ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the Pontic Kingdom, and resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome. - Lucius Cornelius Sisenna ( c. 120 -- 67 BC ) was a Roman soldier , historian , and annalist . He was killed in action during Pompey 's campaign against pirates after the Third Mithridatic War . Sisenna had been commander of the forces on the coast of Greece . He was the author of a history in twenty - three books , all of which have been lost , save a few fragments . Sallust is said to have begun historical work as a continuation of Sisenna 's . Sisenna also translated a collection of erotic and picaresque tales by Aristides of Miletus entitled Milesiae fabulae , which was said to have served as a model for Petronius ' Satyricon . - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot. You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser. Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot. Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer. Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion. If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser. Slightly tilt your head as you raise the shot glass to your mouth. Continue tilting your head and the shot glass at the same time as you drink the liquor. The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat. Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor. Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes. Inhale right before you open your mouth to take the shot. Do not exhale before you drink the liquor. Exhaling before you take the shot may cause you to gag on the shot. Once you have finished the shot, exhale out of your mouth again. Avoid breathing through your nose during the shot taking process. Breathing through your nose intensifies the taste of the shot. Remember to inhale before you take the shot. Inhaling while you take the shot will cause you to inhale fumes and cough. Shots are not meant to be sipped. Holding the liquor in your mouth will make it more difficult for you to swallow the shot or activate your gag reflex. You will also taste the liquor much more if you do not swallow it immediately. Prolonging the shot can also cause the liquor to go down the wrong pipe. Keep your jaw and your throat relaxed as you swallow. Summary:","completion":"A chaser is a beverage consumed after taking a shot of liquor to mitigate its strong taste. Common chasers include soda, juice, and beer. It is advisable to have the chaser prepared before taking the shot, and it can even be sipped prior to the shot and held in the mouth. Beer is the most common chaser, with specific pairings suggested for various liquors such as light lagers with tequila and imperial stout beer with bourbon. An alternative chaser for whiskey is pickle juice. When taking a shot, it is important to slightly tilt the head and the shot glass simultaneously, being cautious not to tilt too far back or create a mess. Inhaling before taking the shot and avoiding exhaling or nose breathing during the process can reduce the chances of gagging or intensifying the drink's taste. Shots should not be sipped and must be swallowed immediately to avoid activating the gag reflex or the possibility of the liquid going down the wrong pipe. Relaxing the jaw and throat during swallowing can further aid in the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: \\"What can ants help plant?\\" Context: \\"Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ants can help plant various flowering plants by acting as pollinators. In the process of pollination, ants transfer pollen between flowers and contribute to the fertilization and sexual reproduction of these plants. This mutualistic relationship benefits both the plants and the ants, as the ants receive energy-rich nectar in return for their pollination services.

The Cold War space missions that never happened Every jaded space nerd has a dream of where they hoped space exploration would take us. By now I imagined the Earth would be circled by gleaming space hotels, flights to the Moon would be routine and the first settlers would be colonising the dusty plains of Mars. As yet, despite Richard Branson’s best efforts, our glittering space future remains as elusive as ever. Although, only the other week, a man in a gorilla suit chased a British astronaut through a space station. So it’s not all bad. For the last 40 years, human progress beyond Earth’s orbit has been painfully slow, with space history littered with hundreds of abandoned projects and concepts. But an alternate and very different pattern of space exploration might have become reality had a few Cold War missions been given the final go-ahead. On the grey concrete of a small outdoor display area at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama sits one of the most unusual engines the agency has ever developed. Mounted on a frame alongside a long thin Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (with “empty” reassuringly painted on the side), the funnel-shaped Nerva engine was designed to take astronauts to Mars. Many rocket engineers still believe that nuclear propulsion has a promising future Developed in the 1960s, Nerva – or Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application – consisted of a cylindrical uranium nuclear fission reactor that heated liquid hydrogen. The gas was then expelled through a rocket nozzle to generate high levels of thrust. Following Wernher von Braun’s plan, Nasa’s first Mars mission was slated for 1979 with astronauts blasting off on a conventional rocket before activating Nera in orbit to carry them onwards to the Red Planet. Around 20 nuclear engines were tested successfully, with the results suggesting it was a promising technology for interplanetary travel. The engine on display at Marshall would have been the most powerful but the project was cancelled in 1973 before anyone could try it out. Many rocket engineers still believe that nuclear propulsion has a promising future. However, the idea of launching a reactor filled with highly radioactive uranium on the top of a rocket filled with explosive gases also, unsurprisingly, has its detractors. One of the scariest spacecraft ever designed emerged from a 1960s Russian programme to militarise the Soyuz spacecraft. The aim was to develop a crewed spacecraft to observe enemy territory and destroy enemy satellites. The plan that emerged was for a manned gunship in space, able to creep up on other spacecraft and fire a projectile to blast them into pieces. The primary target would be American spy satellites as well as any weaponised US spacecraft. A cosmonaut would aim the weapon by pointing the spacecraft and lining up the target in a gunsight. To ensure that when they fired, the Soyuz didn’t recoil backwards or start spinning uncontrollably, the gun was mounted on an independent low-friction platform. Although it seems the technology was developed and cosmonauts trained, the military programme was abandoned in favour of a civilian space station programme. With the advent of more sophisticated spy satellites, it was also decided that there was no need for a man to snap the pictures. The Gemini programme of the mid-60s featured some of the most audacious missions ever flown. With two astronauts crammed into a cockpit around the size of the front seats of a small family car, Gemini notched up a heap of space firsts: the first American spacewalk, the first long-duration spaceflight, the first orbital rendezvous and docking, the first time a spacecraft was fitted with fuel cells and programmable computers. It was so good that its maker McDonnell Douglas had big plans for the little spacecraft, deciding to supersize it to carry nine astronauts. The programme that emerged was called ‘Big G’, described in the promotional brochure as “a truck in space”. Designed to transport astronauts to and from a planned military space station, Big G had two compartments: a regular two-man Gemini capsule at the front and a larger crew cabin behind. McDonnell Douglas drew up detailed plans for the project and built full-sized mock-ups to show Nasa officials how it would all work. With the space station on hold, Big G was finally dropped in favour of the Space Shuttle in 1971. The idea of a large crewed capsule to transport astronauts to and from orbit, however, is once more back in vogue, with Nasa currently funding designs by Boeing and SpaceX. The space station that President Reagan signed off in 1984 was very different to the International Space Station (ISS) that emerged from the political wreckage. Freedom was conceived to be far more than an orbiting laboratory. Not only would it be fitted with labs, it would also have a fully equipped sick bay and recreation facilities. Perhaps most excitingly, the design also featured a hangar – where satellites and spacecraft could be brought in for repair before being released back out into the void. In short, Freedom was far more like the space stations of science fiction than the lumpy collection of cylinders that we have ended up with. Unfortunately, Freedom turned out to be expensive, impractical and – with the end of the Cold War – unnecessary. Although the ISS has few of the refinements of Freedom, it does bring together the two former Cold War rivals. In fact, it would not have been possible without Russian space station expertise. You can read more about the history of the ISS here. During the 1960s the two superpowers developed very different-looking spacecraft to solve the same problems. The Americans favoured conical capsules like Apollo, the Russians liked theirs spherical. In the next decade, however, there was rather more, shall we say, ‘borrowing’ of technology. The Russian Buran spaceplane, for instance, was a straight rip-off of the Space Shuttle. But the Americans too were not immune to copying Soviet space technology. One of the most curious of these borrowed designs was derived from the slipper-shaped MiG-105. Developed in the mid-1960s, the MiG-105 was Russia’s first attempt at a spaceplane. The idea was to blast the small shuttle into orbit on the top of a conventional rocket. It would then return to Earth on a runway. A few successful atmospheric flights proved this was a sound idea and it wasn’t long before the US ‘acquired’ the technology and developed a version of its own. This could easily have become just another Cold War concept that was never going to make it into space. Instead, the original design has been adapted into the Dream Chaser spaceplane being developed by the Sierra Nevada Corporation. With funding from Nasa, the first of these spaceplanes is due to fly – unmanned – to resupply the ISS by the end of the decade. With interest from other nations and commercial operators, a crewed version could yet make it into orbit. Dream Chaser proves that unusual and ambitious ideas developed at the height of the Cold War are sometimes worth revisiting. As we set our sights on Mars, nuclear engines may also make a comeback. As for the space gun… as we reach towards the final frontier, we may need all the crazy ideas we can get.

Adult daughters are often expected to caregiver for older parents. In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time. \\"I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,\\" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline. Though a graduate student struggling to finish her dissertation , Sarich chose to be her dad's full-time caregiver. \\"It's only now, several years later, that I'm realizing how much work it was. It's the kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't cure,\\" she said. About 6 million Americans provide care to elderly relatives or friends living outside of nursing homes. Laurel Kennedy, author of \\"The Daughter Trap\\" (Thomas Dunne Books, 25.95), says that women bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- about 70 percent of hands-on care giving such as bathing. \\"I want to be clear: Women don't hate this,\\" Kennedy said. \\"What they hate is that everyone just assumes they'll do it.\\" Kennedy is calling for _ equal to the rise of affordable child care and day care: Employers should help working caregivers by offering accommodations. Men should step up more often. It's unfair that women are always chosen to provide care for an elderly family member. Despite the hard work it took on Sarich -- interrupted sleep and the knowledge that his 2009 death was the end game, she would do it again.

Article: Most teenagers in Britain receive pocket money from their parents. A report by the Bank of Scotland interviewed over 1,000 young people in Britain and found that 77% get pocket money. Different families give different amounts of pocket money. The average for eight-to-fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about PS6 a week. Children in Scotland receive slightly more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen-to-nineteen-year-olds receive more than PS100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. Lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money. They help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking. A part-time job is a choice for teenagers who don't have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15% of teenagers have a job. Popular part-time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers, shop work, and working in a restaurant or cafe. There are strict government laws about working hours. Only children over 13 can work (there are some exceptions, for example, for actors.) On a school day they can work a maximum of 2 hours a day but not during school hours. At weekends and during school holidays they can work longer hours. The national minimum wage for people aged 16-17 is PS3.57 per hour. 18-year-olds must earn a minimum of PS4.83. There isn't a national minimum waged for people under 16. In Britain some children and teenagers have a bank account. There is no legal age limit at which you can open a bank account but a bank manager can decide whether to allow a child or young person to open an account. Parents can put pocket money directly into their child's bank account and then children can use it to pay for things without carrying money. Saving or spending pocket money, working part-time and dealing with banks are all parts of the process of becoming a financially independent adult and having to earn...

Here is an article: …just went up, with a bit more of a look at what can be done. There’s no magic bullet, but the four steps I outline seem to reflect a common view about what would help. And there’s a risk in writing about eastern Congo that readers think that the whole country is a catastrophe. In fact, most of the country has stabilized and is much better off. On my first visit to Congo in 1997, I drove from Kisangani all the way to the east (it took a week), and for years that was then impossible for security reasons. Now it can be done again, and the road has improved enough that the route takes just two days. Yet one of the problems is that even in places that are now secure, with no warfare, the rapes continue. That’s something we’ve seen elsewhere, such as in Liberia: that even when wars end, sexual violence tends to continue. I can’t tell you how sad it s to see the Kivus still a mess each time I visit, and in some ways worse off than when I first visited. And that doesn’t have to be that way. Sierra Leone was a nightmare and is now doing pretty well. Even Burundi, right next to Congo, is getting its act together.

Joe's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks. Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. Joe looked at his father and said, \\"I wanted to be like you.\\" Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor. Joe did and after he got a bandage on his arm, he and his father rode in the field on the tractor.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What are the best horror movies that will keep you up at night? What are some best horror movies? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Both questions ask for recommendations on the best horror movies, but they differ slightly in their focus. The first question specifically asks for the best horror movies that will keep you up at night, implying that the film should be particularly frightening or unsettling. The second question simply requests some top horror movies, without necessarily focusing on their ability to leave you scared through the night. Given the slight difference, I will provide recommendations to cater to both of the questions: For horror movies that will keep you up at night, I recommend the following: 1. The Exorcist (1973) - Directed by William Friedkin, this classic horror film tells the story of a demon-possessed girl and the attempts to exorcise her. 2. Rosemary's Baby (1968) - Directed by Roman Polanski, this psychological horror movie revolves around a pregnant woman who becomes increasingly paranoid about the safety of her unborn child. 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - Directed by Wes Craven, this film introduces the iconic character Freddy Krueger, a supernatural killer who preys on teenagers in their dreams. 4. The Ring (2002) - Directed by Gore Verbinski, this American remake of the Japanese film \\"Ringu\\" tells the story of a cursed videotape that causes anyone who watches it to die in seven days. 5. Hereditary (2018) - Directed by Ari Aster, this unnerving film focuses on the disturbing and tragic events that unfold after the death of a family's secretive grandmother. 6. The Babadook (2014) - Directed by Jennifer Kent, this psychological horror film tells the story of a mother and son who are haunted by a mysterious and sinister presence in their home. 7. The Conjuring (2013) - Directed by James Wan, this movie is based on the real-life investigations of paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren. It focuses on their experiences with a family dealing with an evil entity in their home. For some more general best horror movies, consider the following: 1. Psycho (1960) - Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this iconic thriller/horror movie is known for its shocking plot twists and infamous shower scene. 2. The Shining (1980) - Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by Stephen King, this film follows a family's terrifying stay at an isolated hotel during the off-season. 3. Get Out (2017) - Directed by Jordan Peele, this social-thriller tells the story of a young black man who discovers a horrifying secret when he meets his white girlfriend's family. 4. Scream (1996) - Directed by Wes Craven, this meta-horror film offers a fresh take on the slasher genre while also paying homage to its roots. 5. The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror film features the iconic characters Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling in a chilling battle of wits. 6. It Follows (2014) - Directed by David Robert Mitchell, this film deals with a supernatural entity that relentlessly pursues its victims after a curse is passed on through sexual contact. 7. The Witch (2016) - Directed by Robert Eggers, this chilling film is set in the 17th century and follows a Puritan family facing mysterious occurrences and witchcraft. In conclusion, both questions seek recommendations for the best horror movies, but they have slightly different emphases. The distinction between them lies in the degree of fear they're looking for in the film recommendations. Regardless, both queries can be addressed with a variety of classic and modern horror movies that cater to different interests and levels of fear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From September, cookery will be a compulsory course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \\"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone.

Article: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming.

Almost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks. Computers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _ If people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \\"teaching\\" the machine and telling the machine \\"yes\\" when the machine is right, and \\"no\\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better. But, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \\"think\\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \\"think\\". People, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944. It would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking.

UPDATED:. 17:34 EST, 30 May 2012. A woman is suing Neiman Marcus after the luxury retailer refused to refund 1.4million worth of goods that her ex-husband gave to her. Patricia Walker from University Park, Texas wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper. The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Ms Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident. Not happy: Patricia Walker (above) from University Park, Texas, is suing Neiman Marcus after the store refused to refund 1.4million worth of goods bought for her by her ex-husband. She claims she never wanted the gifts. Expensive taste: The women's now ex-husband was allegedly cheating on her with her own personal shopper from Neiman Marcus, who received a commission on the goods, some of which are pictured above. The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time. Favi Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer. Mr Ticer is assisting his client in filing a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of 'fraud', 'deceptive trade practices' and a 'violation of company policies' which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame. She had only learned of the alleged affair in 2010, which was just a few months into the couple's divorce. She closed her account with the store immediately after she found out. Ex-husband: Robert Tennison, pictured, is the ex-husband of Ms Walker. He spent 1.4million on gifts for her. Cheater: Favi Lo (above), Ms Walker's personal shopper, is said to have received a steep commission on each of the ex-husband's purchases. She is still employed at the department store in Dallas. Ms Walker was a loyal customer; she had spent 100,000 per year at the store up until her accident. Her husband's total purchases, which are described as 'like new' or in 'mint condition', outweighed her own by hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2007 and 2010. In 2009, his purchases totaled 850,000. Mr Ticer told ABC that the gifts, including a pair of earrings worth 30,000 and a pair pf pajamas worth 285, were items that his client 'couldn't wear and never really wanted'. He said: 'The product of these sales is sex for merchandise.' Distasteful: Mike Ticer (pictured), the woman's attorney, claimed the gifts were items she 'never really wanted' The store's return policy states: 'If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your. timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise. 'Returned. merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the. same condition as when it was received. Used merchandise cannot be. returned unless defective. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply.' After Ms Walker had requested that the goods be refunded, the store sent staff out to inspect the merchandise. Mr Ticer said 'the store never followed through or offered an explanation for not taking the items back'. Location: The Neiman Marcus store in Dallas where Ms Walker's ex-husband purchased the large amount of goods. His mistress, the personal shopper who earned commission on the purchases, still works there. He expressed further disapproval over the company's choice to keep Ms Lo as an employer. She is still employed at the retailer's NorthPark Mall location in Dallas. He said: 'The real villain in this case is Neiman Marcus. After. learning of this affair, they decided they weren't going to do anything about. it.' As for the merchandise, it is currently being held in storage under tight security.

Kim Sears wasn't showing the strain of supporting Britain's number one tennis player as she arrived at Wimbledon today to see him take victory in his first match. While Murray's mother Judy was seen earlier looking tried and grey, by contrast Kim looked happy and relaxed as she walked towards centre court with Andy's entourage. She carried a Mulberry handbag as she walked in heels wearing jeans and a cream blouse with an orange stripe down the front. What pressure? Kim smiles broadly as she walks to centre court to watch her boyfriend. Stylish: The 25 year old wore a blue blazer and jeans as she carried her Mulberry handbag. She topped her outfit off with a colourful blue blazer, a broad smile and perfectly blow dried hair. But despite her demeanor today, on the BBC documentary broadcast last night called Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racquet, when asked by Sue Barker if she looked forward to Wimbledon she replied with a laugh: 'No, I used to!' The 25-year-old is usually seen to be on tenterhooks as Murray goes from round to round as the pressure for him to win on home turf is immense. Last year he came painstakingly close to becoming the first Brit to win the title in decades as he made the final and won the first set, only to then be defeated by Roger Federer. He famously choked back tears as he gave a gallant loser speech while Kim was also seen looking tearful in the royal box. Colourful: Kim teamed a blue blazer with a cream and orange blouse. Here we go again: Kim arrived in her seat in time to see Andy take to centre court again. Still smiling: Kim could relax as Andy won the first set and then the match. One step closer: Kim applauds as her boyfriend's quest to win Wimbledon gets off to a good start. Kim recalled of the heartbreaking moment: 'There were a lot of tears,. it's just horrible seeing someone you care about going through that. The immediate aftermath wasn't pretty.' But since then she has seen her boyfriend go from strength to strength - winning Olympic gold and silver medals and his first grand slam title in New York. Murray returned to centre court today to begin his campaign today against German's Benjamin Becker. Confident start: Murray celebrates after staring the tournament with a win in straight sets. Relief: Judy Murray had looked strained earlier in the day but broke into a smile after her son's victory. Supporters: Pippa and James Middleton have been following the centre court action all day and cheered Murray on on his match. The tennis champ took to Twitter ahead of his opener to express gratitude to his fans for their backing and encouragement. 'I'll give everything I have on the court starting with round 1', he wrote. He was true to his word, beating the German in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. As well as Kim, also watching from the royal box was his ever present mother, Judy, and tennis fans Pippa and James Middleton. High hopes: Once again the nation is behind Andy Murray's bid to become Wimbledon champ. Support: Kim told Sue Barker that she doesn't look forward to Wimbledon and it was hard last year when her boyfriend was so upset by his loss in the final. On yesterday's BBC documentary Kim also revealed what it was like to be suddenly thrust into the lime light when he won his first tournament at San Jose in 2006. She was a teenager still at school at the time and explained: 'I went away with him thinking it's fine because he's never going to win so I'll be back in time for school on Monday and then he did! I remember saying to my mum, you've got to call in and tell them I've got the winter vomiting virus and I won't be in but then it was on the front cover of the paper so I was busted!

Guido sets up many \\"coincidental\\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosué, and run a bookstore. When World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosué are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Yu Pengnian is an 88-year-old real estate Chinese businessman. He amassed a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies. Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity. Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity. A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism.

During the Ottoman period, the citys population of Ottomans Muslims (including those of Turkish people and Albanians origin, as well as Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Question: Why did the state hospital refuse to practice surgeon for Ziad Matouk? Options: A: Because he couldn't afford the fee at a public hospital. B: Because the hospital didn't accept dangerous patients. C: Because they couldn't find a matched organ. D: Because his condition was untreatable.

Here's the step-by-step process: Step 1: Understand the definition The ripened part of a flowering plant that contains seeds is usually called the \\"fruit.\\" It is the mature ovary of a flowering plant and is responsible for protecting and dispersing seeds. Step 2: Investigate plant anatomy To identify the fruit, it's essential to be familiar with the basic structure of flowering plants. The main parts include the roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Each of these structures contributes to the growth, reproduction, and overall survival of the plant. Step 3: Locate the fruit Once familiar with plant anatomy, focus on the flower components. As a flower matures and undergoes pollination, the ovary develops into the fruit. Trace back from the petals to the base of the flower, which will lead to the fruit. Step 4: Observe the fruit's characteristics Fruits come in various shapes, sizes, and colors – from oranges and apples to berries and nuts. Some characteristics to consider when identifying the fruit are its shape, texture, color, and whether it is fleshy or dry. Step 5: Verify seed presence Finally, examine the fruit to confirm the presence of seeds.

He says that \\"digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb\\" and \\"food is digested and absorbed in the small intestine\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"The best answer to the quiz question \\"Where does digestion happen?\\" is the Small intestine. According to the hints provided by the teacher, digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb, and food is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. The small intestine is a crucial part of the gastrointestinal tract, as it is the primary site for digestion and absorption of nutrients. The small intestine consists of three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Each section plays a different role in the digestion process. 1. Duodenum: The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine, responsible for receiving partially digested food from the stomach in the form of chyme. It continues the process of chemical digestion with the help of enzymes and digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. These secretions help to break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats present in the chyme. 2. Jejunum: The jejunum is the middle segment of the small intestine, which is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption. Here, the broken-down components of food (amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, vitamins, and minerals) are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. The main feature of the jejunum is the presence of finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for more efficient absorption. 3. Ileum: The ileum is the last section of the small intestine, where any remaining nutrients are absorbed, including vitamin B12 and bile salts. This section also contains villi, which help in the absorption process. In conclusion, the small intestine is the best answer to the question \\"Where does digestion happen?\\" as it is the primary site where the mechanical and chemical digestion of food is completed and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream for the body to utilize."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert, which is located on the continent of Antarctica. It may be surprising to some people since deserts are often associated with hot, arid landscapes, but the definition of a desert is not constrained to temperature. A desert is defined by the amount of precipitation it receives and its limited ability to support life, specifically plant and animal species. In the case of the Antarctic Desert, it experiences extremely low temperatures and minimal precipitation, making it the largest and coldest desert in the world. The Antarctic Desert covers an area of approximately 14 million square kilometers, making it almost 1.5 times larger than the second largest desert in the world, the Arctic Desert, which is situated in the Arctic region at the Earth's North Pole. Comparatively, the third largest desert on Earth and the most famous hot desert, the Sahara Desert, is much smaller, at 9.2 million square kilometers, and can be found in North Africa. Antarctica, located at the southernmost part of the Earth, is surrounded by the Southern Ocean and is almost entirely covered in ice. This ice sheet covering 98% of the continent's surface makes the Antarctic Desert unique in comparison to other deserts. The continent experiences extremely harsh climatic conditions, featuring cold temperatures that can drop as low as -89 degrees Celsius (-128 degrees Fahrenheit), strong winds, and sporadic snowfall. The Antarctic Desert's ice sheet is the largest freshwater reserve on Earth, accounting for approximately 70% of the planet’s freshwater supply. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, there are seasons of continuous daylight during summer months and total darkness during winter months in this desert. The constant sunlight during the summer can lead to an increase in the temperature, creating seasonal meltwater lakes. Despite these hostile environmental conditions, the Antarctic Desert is home to a unique and hardy array of native wildlife, such as the Emperor Penguin, the Weddell Seal, and the Antarctic krill, which form the base of the food chain. In terms of vegetation, only a few resilient forms of plants and mosses are found here due to the scarce availability of nutrients and the extreme climate. Although the continent of Antarctica is mostly uninhabited by humans, there are numerous research stations scattered across the continent, where scientists from various countries conduct research in the fields of climatology, geology, biology, and glaciology. The Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959, regulates these activities and ensures that the continent remains a place of peace, scientific cooperation, and environmental preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio, known as Motown's Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on Let's Get It On. Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973. Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers, who had contributed to Gaye's What's Going On, and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs \\"The World is Rated X\\" and \\"Where Are We Going\\" and the single \\"You're the Man\\" (1972) at Golden World. \\"Where Are We Going\\" was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You're the Man, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of Let's Get It On. The album's first recording, \\"Let's Get It On\\", was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye's preliminary mix of Stover's draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly \\"about making sweet love.\\" Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter's presence during the album's recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album I Want You. While recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio. Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad \\"If I Should Die Tonight\\", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\" was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song's co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", which were done by The Originals. Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, and percussionist Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown. Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions.

Sentence from a movie review: really funny Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the provided sentence from a movie review, which states that it was \\"really funny,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. Humor is a significant factor for many people when evaluating the quality of a film, particularly when it comes to comedies, as it indicates that the movie was successful in entertaining and amusing its audience. In the context of a one-sentence review, using the term \\"really funny\\" implies that the movie exceeded the expectations of a usual comedy and delivered humor in an effective and memorable way. While this brief review does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the film, it highlights one aspect that has resonated positively with the viewer, which is the humor. This positive reaction to the film's comedic elements suggests that the movie was able to engage and delight the reviewer, thus providing a favorable viewing experience. It is essential to acknowledge, however, that a single positive aspect does not always define a movie's overall reception. Other factors, such as plot, character development, and filmmaking quality, can play crucial roles in determining whether a film is seen in a positive or negative light. In the absence of information about these aspects, one can only assume that the movie's humor contributed to a positive perception of the film. In conclusion, based on the sentence from the movie review mentioning that the film was \\"really funny,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer, at least in terms of its humor.

(Franco Origlia/Getty Images) Since Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became Pope Francis in March, the new pontiff has made headlines around the world for his emphasis on social and economic equality. The first major document of his papacy, released today, is no different. Though framed as a call for Catholics to embrace a new evangelization, much of “Evangelii Gaudium” is relevant to both Catholics and non-Catholics — especially the pope’s stinging critique of the unequal economy that we live in. He writes: Just as the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say “thou shalt not” to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills. How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points? This is a case of exclusion. Can we continue to stand by when food is thrown away while people are starving? This is a case of inequality. Today everything comes under the laws of competition and the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves excluded and marginalized: without work, without possibilities, without any means of escape. Trickle-down economics comes in for a hiding, as does the market: In this context, some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting…. This imbalance is the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently, they reject the right of states, charged with vigilance for the common good, to exercise any form of control. A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules. Now, as Tim Fernholz and others have noted, Francis is far from the first pontiff to attack the capitalist system. But such a take is a bit too jaded. First, as Fernholz notes, Francis’s arguments are more specific, name-checking modern theories like “trickle-down” economics. Second, unlike many of his predecessors, Francis is actually practicing the humility he preaches, from giving up the opulent papal residence to using a 30-year-old Renault as his personal vehicle. And unlike all but his most immediate predecessors, the Web allows his calls for humility and equality to be broadcast directly to people around the world, rather than filtered through political and religious establishments. Francis’s approach is succeeding: There is evidence that the pope’s tenure has already seen many Catholics return to Mass (though the effect is mixed in the United States). Either way, the fact is that Francis is only saying what more and more people in the United States and around the world recognize: The increasing inequality of recent decades “cannot be the basis of hope for a better future.” Now if only our leaders would listen. Gallery: Pope Francis’s acts of humility ||||| Look at this radical anti-capitalist. (Wikimedia Commons) Can you believe the latest papal news, hot off the presses in Rome? Everyone’s talking about how a Catholic pope would criticize capitalism with words like these: On inequality and the financialization of the economy: “Hence, by degrees it has come to pass that working men have been surrendered, isolated and helpless, to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked competition. The mischief has been increased by rapacious usury, which, although more than once condemned by the Church, is nevertheless, under a different guise, but with like injustice, still practiced by covetous and grasping men. To this must be added that the hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few; so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself.” On the welfare state: “As regards the State, the interests of all, whether high or low, are equal. The members of the working classes are citizens by nature and by the same right as the rich; they are real parts, living the life which makes up, through the family, the body of the commonwealth; and it need hardly be said that they are in every city very largely in the majority. It would be irrational to neglect one portion of the citizens and favor another, and therefore the public administration must duly and solicitously provide for the welfare and the comfort of the working classes; otherwise, that law of justice will be violated which ordains that each man shall have his due.” On the virtues of wealth and poverty: “Therefore, those whom fortune favors are warned that riches do not bring freedom from sorrow and are of no avail for eternal happiness, but rather are obstacles; that the rich should tremble at the threatenings of Jesus Christ—threatenings so unwonted in the mouth of our Lord—and that a most strict account must be given to the Supreme Judge for all we possess…God Himself seems to incline rather to those who suffer misfortune; for Jesus Christ calls the poor “blessed”; He lovingly invites those in labor and grief to come to Him for solace; and He displays the tenderest charity toward the lowly and the oppressed. These reflections cannot fail to keep down the pride of the well-to-do, and to give heart to the unfortunate.” On the abuse of workers: “The first thing of all to secure is to save unfortunate working people from the cruelty of men of greed, who use human beings as mere instruments for money-making. It is neither just nor human so to grind men down with excessive labor as to stupefy their minds and wear out their bodies.” Oh, wait. Got my encyclicals mixed up. This is all from 1891, when Pope Leo XIII was trying to find a Catholic alternative to socialism and capitalism; his encyclical Rerum Novarum became central to the church’s economic thought. The text you’re probably looking for today is the 2013 apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis, which strikes similar themes. The 2013 version is more strident and specific, but perhaps that’s because so little has changed. ||||| *** In 1962, as the Second Vatican Council opened in Rome, Europe was deeply divided. In his book What Happened at Vatican II, Jesuit historian John O’Malley set the scene: The Iron Curtain had fallen. For Catholicism this meant, among other things, that even the simplest communication with bishops and the faithful in Eastern Europe was difficult and fraught with dangers. The arrest and trial of the primate of Hungary, Cardinal József Mindszenty, in 1948, opened the public’s eyes to the brutal attitude of the Communist regime toward the Church. The even more brutal suppression of the revolution there by Russian troops in 1956 was just one more confirmation that no reconciliation was possible between “the free world” and “the Soviet bloc.” Thirteen years earlier, at the end of World War II, the Holy Office had officially excommunicated communists from the Catholic Church and declared the ideology at odds with fundamental tenets of the faith. But in the lead-up to the Council, it wasn't clear whether the broader body of Church leaders would make a similar statement. Several bishops from communist countries weren’t able to travel to Rome because their visas were denied. Although certain bishops, particularly those from the Eastern bloc, pushed for a sweeping statement against communism, the Council never formally considered a proposal to make a statement. Before he died in 1963, the pope who convened the Council, John XXIII, did issue an encyclical, Pacem in Terris, which addressed the issue of “universal peace.” While he didn’t condemn communism, he did endorse democracy. “The fact that authority comes from God does not mean that men have no power to choose those who are to rule the State, or to decide upon the type of government they want,” he wrote. “Hence the above teaching is consonant with any genuinely democratic form of government.” The following year, John’s successor, Pope Paul VI, made a much clearer statement against communism in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam. “We are driven to repudiate such ideologies as deny God and oppress the Church,” he wrote. “These ideologies are often identified with economic, social and political regimes; atheistic communism is a glaring instance of this.” Albeit in somewhat passive terms, the Church had made its political and economic position clear: It rejected communism, and specifically its suppression of religion, in favor of the West and democracy—which were tied tightly to free-market economic principles. Many years later, the Polish Pope John Paul II was given credit for helping to undermine communist rule in his country, where Catholic churches provided a space for anti-communist artists and thinkers to hold discussions and distribute anti-regime writings. In light of this long-standing tension between the Church and communism, Pope Francis’s aggressively anti-capitalist posture seems all the more remarkable. The bishop of Rome hasn't just condemned what he sees as a failed free-market—he'a condemned the ethic and ideology that underlie free-market economies. “The culture of prosperity deadens us; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase,” Francis writes. “In the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Pope Francis has made headlines for his emphasis on social and economic equality since he became Pope in 2013. In \\"Evangelii Gaudium,\\" Pope Francis questions the economy of exclusion and inequality, stating that such an economy kills. He criticizes trickle-down economics and the market, arguing that economic growth and a free market has not succeeded in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. Pope Francis's approach to humility and equality has brought more attention to these issues and has seen many Catholics return to Mass. His message emphasizes that the increasing inequality cannot be the basis of hope for a better future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While both statements involve a man roller skating for a crowd of spectators, there are significant differences in the level of detail that prevent us from concluding that the first statement can be inferred from the second statement. The second statement, \\"Man roller skates for a crowd to watch,\\" is a more generalized and ambiguous version of the event without providing any specific information about the man's appearance or the exact circumstances of the display. On the other hand, the first statement, \\"A tall black man in yellow pants shows his roller-skating skills while pedestrians watch,\\" provides a more complete and vivid description of the scene. This statement indicates the man's height, race, clothing, and the fact that he is demonstrating skillful roller-skating. Moreover, it specifies that the spectators watching are pedestrians. There are multiple reasons why we cannot conclude the first statement based on the second statement: 1. The second statement does not mention any descriptive details about the man's appearance, while the first statement highlights that he is tall, black, and wearing yellow pants. 2. The second statement does not explicitly state that the man is showcasing his roller-skating skills, while the first statement emphasizes his skilled performance. 3. The second statement makes no mention of the type of crowd, whereas the first statement clarifies that the spectators are pedestrians. Given the lack of specific details in the second statement, it is not possible to ascertain whether the intended meaning aligns with the first statement. While it could potentially refer to the same event, the insufficient information makes it impossible to make a definite conclusion.

Complete the next sentence: How to press tofu Determine if you need to press the tofu at all. Silken tofu does not need pressing, as it is softer and used more often in blended dishes. Firm and extra firm tofu almost always needs to be pressed, as it's density allows it to keep more water when cooking.","completion":"To press firm or extra firm tofu, follow these steps: 1. Drain the tofu: Remove the tofu from its packaging and drain any excess water. This step is important because it helps to get rid of the initial moisture content before pressing. 2. Slice the tofu block: Cut the tofu into slabs about half an inch thick. Slicing it makes it easier for the moisture to be removed during pressing and can also help to achieve a more even press. 3. Prepare a clean towel or paper towel: Lay out a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels on a flat surface. This helps to wick away moisture from the tofu during the pressing process. 4. Place the tofu on the towel: Arrange the tofu slices in a single layer on the towel or paper towel, leaving some space in between each piece to allow for proper absorption. 5. Cover the tofu: Place another layer of clean towel or paper towel on top of the tofu slices, ensuring they are fully covered. This helps to absorb the moisture that is pressed out of the tofu. 6. Add weight: Place a flat, heavy object on top of the covered tofu, such as a cutting board with a few canned goods or a heavy skillet. This applies pressure to the tofu, forcing the excess water out and into the towels. 7. Press the tofu: Leave the tofu to press for at least 30 minutes, although pressing for an hour or more can result in a firmer texture. Check the towels periodically and replace them if they become saturated with water. 8. Cook the tofu: Once the tofu has been pressed to your desired level of firmness, remove it from the towels, and it is ready to be prepared in your desired recipe. Pressed tofu has a better texture for dishes like stir-fries, grilled or pan-fried dishes, as it absorbs flavors and holds its shape better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the footage, Ford is seen swearing, stumbling and acting erratically outside city hall while wearing a beaded necklace in honor of St. Patrick’s Day. The footage was broadcast by CTV on Sunday night and features Ford calling someone a ‘f***ing idiot!’ The video starts with a woman speaking to Ford from her car, while her son films it. ‘No problem, no problem, no problem,’ Ford is heard saying in the video as he tries to hail a taxi. After being hugged by one man, Ford approaches a cab and then can be heard shouting ‘f***ing idiot!’ Ford reacted with irritation when a CTV reporter questioned him about the video during the Patrick’s Day Parade on Sunday. Toronto's scandal plagued mayor Rob Ford, right, walks along Bloor Street West with his brother, City Councillor Doug Ford, during Sunday's St. Patrick's Day parade. ‘Give me a break, guys,’ he said. ‘Are you serious? Were you drinking last night? You never drink, right? You guys don’t drink.’ The weekend incident comes two years after Ford’s drunken St. Patrick’s Day party inside the mayor’s office and months after he swore off drinking entirely after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor.' After his crack-smoking confession last November, Ford swore off booze entirely, claiming that he had a ‘come to Jesus moment.’ He admitted to drinking again in January after video surfaced online of him inside the Steak Queen restaurant in Etobicoke where he appeared intoxicated as he swore and ranted in Jamaican patois. Toronto's scandal plagued mayor Rob Ford takes 'selfies' with people along Bloor Street West during the St. Patrick's Day parade in freezing cold temperatures in Toronto.

Along with the photo he tweeted, Spacey wrote: 'When did Mayor Ford start doing what people tell him to do? All you had to do was ask, guys. Here's your pic.' During Spacey's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the actor cracked several jokes at the mayor's expense when Spacey appeared after a brief cameo by Ford. 'That's the first time I've had to follow a Ford,' Spacey quipped. 'And one that was so banged up.'

May 6 was declared 'Hanson Day' in Tulsa by Oklahoma's then-governor Frank Keating. Although 'Hanson Day' was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, many Hanson fans all over the world still recognize May 6 as Hanson Day every year. Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson's first documentary Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere and their Christmas album Snowed In in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched MOE (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. Hanson: The Official Book reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled Live From Albertane, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary The Road to Albertane. In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released MMMBop as 3 Car Garage, minus four tracks, in May 1998. To date, the tracks from Boomerang have not been re-released. Three tracks from Boomerang (\\"Boomerang\\", \\"More Than Anything\\", and \\"Rain (Falling Down)\\") and two of the remaining tracks from MMMBop (\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Baby (You're So Fine)\\") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members. During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what would later become the songs for their second major studio album, This Time Around. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. Almost immediately following the changeover in May 2000, Hanson released their second album, This Time Around, but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"United States\\" correctly answer the question \\"According to the text, coastal Algarve is similar to what region of the world?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"United States\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"According to the text, coastal Algarve is similar to what region of the world?\\".

I have a new situation: Two students read about brains in the animal kingdom. Tom read more about the brains of mammals, while Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians. But I can use this background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal. What is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum?","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the subject of the question - The question is asking about which student learned less about a specific part of the brain called the neocortex. Step 2: Review the background information provided - Tom read more about the brains of mammals. - Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians. - The neocortex is a unique layer of nerve cells in the brains of mammals, and it plays a significant role in various complex brain functions. Step 3: Analyze the information - The question is focused on the neocortex, which is unique to mammals. - Tom studied the brains of mammals, while Reed studied the brains of amphibians. Step 4: Draw a conclusion from the information - Since the neocortex is found only in the brains of mammals and Tom studied mammal brains, Reed, who studied amphibian brains, learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum, also known as the neocortex."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following passage \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: This step may look different depending on the type of gum you've selected. If you have chosen a stick of gum, you might fold the piece in half as you pop it into your mouth. With smaller tabs, you might even place two in your mouth at once. If you've chosen a giant gumball, you may opt to bite off half. You may need to chew a bit more vigorously to loosen up a new piece of gum. Use your big teeth in the back of your mouth, called your molars, to chew. Molars are the teeth associated with chewing because of their flatter surfaces. This will ensure that one side of your mouth doesn't get tired from the repetitive chewing motion. Occasionally, draw the gum to the front of your mouth and exercise your biting teeth. This will give your molars a short break. If you are not in a formal setting, you can try blowing bubbles. Enjoy the flavor that you've chosen. As you chew, the flavoring agents in the gum will gradually dissolve and be swallowed, so eventually the gum loses its flavor completely. Urban legend suggests that swallowed gum remains in your stomach for years, but this isn't factual. Gum is passed through your digestive tract into your stool. However, frequently swallowing your gum can lead to constipation and other minor stomach issues, so it isn't recommended. The easiest thing is to just spit it out once you are finished. Because the gum is still sticky, it can make a big mess if you don't discard it properly. It's a good idea to save your gum wrapper so that you can wrap your gum in it when you've finished. If you didn't save the wrapper, just wrap it in a tissue or a scrap of paper.","completion":"This is about chewing gum. There are different types of gum, like sticks, tabs, or big gumballs.

James needed to reduce the sound of his music whenever he is in the neighborhood because the","completion":"neighbors had expressed their concerns about the loud volume disturbing their peace and tranquility. As someone who valued good relationships with those around him, James took it upon himself to come up with a well-thought-out solution that would satisfy his love for music without causing further disruptions. He began researching various ways to lessen the impact of the sound without compromising on the quality of his listening experience. After several days of searching, James stumbled upon a few viable options that could potentially help him strike the perfect balance. One of the most promising ideas was the use of noise-cancelling headphones. These would allow James to keep his music at a comfortable volume for himself while minimizing the noise that leaks out into the surrounding environment. After testing a few different models, he discovered that over-ear headphones with active noise cancellation provided the best insulation against external disturbances. This solution not only ensured that his neighbors could enjoy a quieter atmosphere, but it also enhanced his own listening experience by blocking out any extraneous sounds. Another possible solution James considered was the installation of acoustic panels in his room. These panels, made from a variety of materials such as foam or fiberglass, are designed to absorb sound waves and dampen the propagation of noise. By strategically placing these sound-absorbing materials around his room, James could better isolate his music from other areas of the house and, by extension, from his neighbors. While researching these options, James also became aware of certain music genres that were more conducive to maintaining a peaceful environment. For instance, he discovered that ambient and classical music generally had a calming effect on listeners, reducing the likelihood of complaints from those around him. To further accommodate his neighbors, James decided to explore and incorporate these genres into his playlist during the hours when people were most likely to be at home and in need of quiet. Lastly, James resolved to establish a regular practice of communication with his neighbors, keeping the lines of dialogue open to ensure that he was aware of any potential issues that might arise. This proactive approach demonstrated his commitment to fostering a harmonious living atmosphere for everyone in the community. In summary, James needed to reduce the sound of his music in the neighborhood to maintain good relations with his neighbors and respect their need for peace and quiet. By investing in noise-cancelling headphones, installing acoustic panels, adjusting his music preferences, and engaging in ongoing communication with his fellow residents, he was able to create an environment that catered to both his love for music and his commitment to being a considerate neighbor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the partial collection that the government received from Steamtown that is still on display in Scranton? from the following article ? Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount. The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors. Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site. The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition. Part of the Blount collection is still on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton. A:","completion":"The partial collection that the government received from Steamtown, which is still on display in Scranton, Pennsylvania, comprises of various steam locomotives, railroad cars, and related pieces of equipment that were retained after the United States government acquired and developed the Steamtown National Historic Site. The decision to keep these pieces in the collection was primarily based on their historical value and relevance to the site's mission. The Steamtown, U.S.A., steam locomotive museum was originally founded by F. Nelson Blount in the 1960s and operated steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, until 1983. After Blount's death in 1967, the non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations, but faced numerous challenges in the later years it operated. The relocation of some pieces of the Steamtown collection to Scranton happened in the mid-1980s due to Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track. However, within two years of the move, Steamtown was facing bankruptcy, and more of its collection was sold to settle debts. In 1986, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. The National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the remaining equipment in the possession of the Steamtown Foundation. This research led to the publication of the Steamtown Special History Study in 1991, which provided concise histories of each piece and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces were removed from the collection as a result of this government acquisition. Today, part of the original Blount collection is still on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The retained collection includes historically significant steam locomotives, railroad cars, and other equipment that showcase the rich history and heritage of American railroading, paying homage to the vision of F. Nelson Blount and commemorating an important era in the development and progress of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: who could disable the omnitrix's self-destruct-mode? Movie title: Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix Movie plot: During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \\"DNA bomb\\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben). While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Gwen blames Ben's selfishness despite the fact that Ben had nothing to do with it. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames... Answer:","completion":"Azmuth, the creator of the Omnitrix, is the one who could disable the Omnitrix's self-destruct mode. In the movie, Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix, the main characters, Ben Tennyson, Tetrax, Gwen, and Myaxx, are in search of Azmuth to save the Omnitrix from its self-destruct countdown. Azmuth is a highly intelligent and reclusive Galvan scientist who designed the Omnitrix as a tool to restore and preserve genetic diversity across the universe. Initially, he is hesitant to help Ben and his team as he thinks they misuse the powers of the Omnitrix. However, after witnessing Ben's heroism and willingness to risk his life to save others, he decides to help.

Coyote (Eatibus Anythingus) trudges across the desert floor, catching and eating anything that he finds to satisfy himself, ranging from a fly to an empty tin can, before being flattened by the Road Runner (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile's low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote's eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. 1. First, the coyote uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. 2. The clearly angry coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. 3.

The camera displays a road with a pop-up grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of unspringing the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing.

They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries. Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children. Question: are the berries on a holly tree poisonous?","completion":"Yes, the berries on a holly tree are poisonous to both humans and pets. The primary toxic components of holly berries are ilicin, saponins, and various alkaloids, which can cause a range of undesirable symptoms upon ingestion. In particular, holly berries have been known to cause vomiting and diarrhea, along with several other symptoms such as nausea, dehydration, dizziness, and stomach pain. When ingested in large quantities, holly berries pose a significant risk to small children who may be attracted to their bright red color and accidentally consume them. If a child consumes more than 20 holly berries, the toxic compounds present in the berries can be potentially fatal. In case of ingestion, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention, preferably with the assistance of a poison control center. Additionally, holly tree berries can pose a threat to pets, such as dogs and cats, since they may also be drawn to the colorful berries and consume them accidentally. Pets that ingest holly berries may exhibit symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, excessive drooling, and lack of coordination. In extreme cases, seizures may occur. It is crucial to contact a veterinarian promptly should your pet ingest holly berries to ensure that they receive appropriate treatment. To prevent accidents involving holly berries, it is important to be mindful of the presence of holly trees in your surroundings. In households with young children and pets, it is advisable to either remove holly trees or place barriers around them to minimize the risk of accidental consumption. In summary, holly tree berries are indeed poisonous, especially to young children and pets. Caution is vital when it comes to ensuring the safety of those who may be at risk of ingesting the berries. Immediate action should be taken in case of ingestion, as the toxic effects associated with the consumption of holly berries can be severe and potentially life-threatening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - closet - musical instrument store - instrument case - music shop - music store The answer is \\"instrument case\\" because Answer:","completion":"Storing your mandolin in an instrument case is the best option among the choices provided, due to several reasons. An instrument case is specifically designed to protect and preserve the instrument from possible damage, maintain its optimal condition, and make transporting the mandolin more convenient and secure. 1. Protection: Instrument cases are made to shield your mandolin from a variety of potential hazards. They are constructed with durable materials that can withstand impact and prevent the mandolin from getting dented, scratched, or otherwise damaged. The case's interior also provides a cushioned environment, which helps absorb any shock the case might experience during transport. Furthermore, the case's design helps protect the mandolin from humidity and temperature fluctuations that can negatively impact the instrument's wooden components. 2. Preservation: Whenever the mandolin is not in use, it's essential to store it in a place where its condition remains consistent. An instrument case is designed to maintain optimal conditions for storage. The controlled environment inside the case allows the mandolin to age well, ensuring better sound quality over time. Proper storage also prevents warping and other damage that could weaken the instrument's structural integrity. 3. Transport: Cases for mandolins are specifically tailored to fit the instrument's unique shape and size snugly. This makes it easier to carry and transport your mandolin securely, as it will not shift or move around inside the case. Cases are often equipped with handles or straps for easy carry, and they can also be locked to prevent theft or tampering when you are traveling or storing your instrument away from home. 4. Organization: Mandolin cases often have compartments to store accessories such as picks, strings, tuners, and extra parts. Having these items organized and in one place makes it easy for you to access them when needed, prevents loss, and ensures that you are always prepared for performances, rehearsals, or practice sessions. In contrast, the other options listed – closet, musical instrument store, music shop, and music store – do not offer the same level of protection, preservation, and convenience as an instrument case. Storing your mandolin in a closet may expose it to changes in temperature and humidity, while leaving it at a musical instrument store, music shop, or music store means it is more susceptible to accidents or misplacement. In conclusion, an instrument case is the most suitable and practical option for storing your mandolin when not in use. Not only does it protect your instrument from potential damage and provide a consistent storage environment, but it also makes transportation and organization more manageable. By storing your mandolin in a proper instrument case, you can ensure that it remains in good condition and continues to produce high-quality sound throughout its life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person that said the album released in 1982 offered a middle ground between funk and jazz? Answer the above question based on the context below: A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

This move further complicates efforts to close the infamous detention center, which has long been a subject of human rights concerns and international criticism. Background Established in 2002 during the George W. Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba has been home to hundreds of detainees, most of whom were captured in the war against terrorism. Throughout its existence, the detention center has been marred by numerous allegations of abuse, torture, and indefinite detention, leading to calls from human rights groups, foreign governments, and even past and present U.S. officials for its closure. Efforts to Close Guantanamo In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order directing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within one year. However, various legal, political, and logistical hurdles have prevented the fulfillment of that order. Then-President Trump endorsed keeping the prison open during his term, further halting progress on its closure. In January 2021, President Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to closing the detention facility, stating that doing so would uphold America's values and signal a departure from controversial counterterrorism policies. However, the recent House vote against transferring detainees to U.S. soil makes it increasingly challenging to fulfill this pledge. The House Vote The amendment to prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Congressman Mat Gates. The amendment received broad support from Republicans and a handful of Democrats, resulting in a final vote of 218-204. Some legislators argue that the detainees should not be released or transferred until there are clear plans for their ultimate disposition. The primary argument against bringing detainees to U.S. soil lies in the concern that doing so could pose a security risk to the nation. Proponents of this position argue that these individuals, who have allegedly been involved in terrorism and other illicit activities, may pose continued threats if they are allowed back into the United States. Additionally, there is the potential for unrest and hostility from communities where these detainees would be held or put on trial. Counterarguments Critics of the recent House vote assert that the refusal to transfer detainees to U.S. soil perpetuates the inhumane conditions and marginalization that have long plagued Guantanamo. They note that many of these detainees have never been charged and may have been wrongfully held, leading to further human rights abuses. These opponents argue that transferring detainees to face trial and potential imprisonment in the United States would not only uphold the rule of law but also provide these individuals with due process, a principle enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, they believe that the closure of Guantanamo Bay would remove a significant recruitment tool for terrorist organizations and demonstrate America's commitment to upholding human rights. Conclusion The decision by the House of Representatives to vote against bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. soil underscores the complexity and sensitivity surrounding the future of this notorious detention facility and its prisoners. Despite President Biden's stated intent to close Guantanamo, achieving that objective will be an uphill battle requiring untangling layers of legal, political, and ethical issues. The recent House vote is a reminder of the deep divisions that persist in the quest for a resolution to a persistent international headache, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added. But many in the Senate appear... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long has General John Nicholson been in the armed forces?

Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin. What happens to a majority of ingested uranium?","completion":"When someone ingests uranium, most of it leaves their body during digestion. That means it doesn't stay inside them, but instead comes out when they go to the bathroom. So, a majority of ingested uranium is not absorbed by the body but instead gets excreted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What does a police officer in their sixities? Possible A: retire, direct traffic, case, fine person for speeding, order to stop running Why is \\"retire\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Retire\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it takes into consideration the typical age for retirement and the physical demands of a job like a police officer. Step 1: Understand the context of the question and possible answers. The given question asks about the possible actions of a police officer in their sixties. Possible answers include retire, direct traffic, case, fine person for speeding, and order to stop running. Step 2: Consider the typical age for retirement. In many countries, the retirement age ranges between 60 to 65 years old. This means that when people reach their sixties, they are usually nearing or at the age where they might consider or be eligible to retire. Step 3: Take into account the physical demands of a police officer. Being a police officer can be physically demanding because it involves activities such as chasing suspects, making arrests, and dealing with emergencies. With age, one's physical capabilities might decline, making it harder to efficiently and safely perform in such roles. Step 4: Compare \\"retire\\" to the other possible answers. Given the retirement age and the physical demands of the job, \\"retire\\" becomes a more plausible and reasonable answer aligned with human common sense as it considers the natural progression of an individual's career and age-related factors. While the other possible answers involve actions a police officer might take, \\"retire\\" specifically addresses the age context of the question. So, \\"retire\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense based on the typical age for retirement and the physical demands associated with being a police officer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The finding helps to explain why people enjoy listening to sad music, say Ai Kawakami and her colleagues from Tokyo University of the Arts and the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan. Ai Kawakami and her colleagues asked 44 volunteers, including both musicians and nonspecialists, to listen to two pieces of sad music and one piece of happy music. Each participant was required to use a set of keywords to rate both their perception of the music and their own emotional state. The sad pieces of music included Glinka's La Separation in F minor and Blumenfeld's Etude Sur Mer in G minor. The happy music piece was Granados's Allegro de Concierto in G major. To control the \\"happy\\" effect of major key, they also played the minor key pieces in major key, and vise versa. The researchers explained that sad music aroused contradictory emotions because the participants of the study tended to feel sad to be more tragic and less romantic than they felt themselves while listening to it. \\" In general, sad music causes sadness in listeners, and sadness is regarded as an unpleasant emotion. If sad music actually arouses only unpleasant emotion, we would not listen to it,\\" the researchers wrote in the study. \\"Music that is believed as sad actually causes romantic emotion as well as sad emotion.And people, regardless of their musical training, experience this ambivalent emotion to listen to the sad music,\\" added the researchers. Also, unlike sadness in daily life, sadness experienced through art actually feels pleasant, possibly because the latter does not cause an actual threat to our safety. This could help people to deal with their negative emotions in daily life, concluded the authors. \\"Emotion experienced by music has no direct danger or harm unlike the emotion experienced in everyday life.

Movie title: Tideland Context: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father.

When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt.

One possible expanded answer could be: The period that ended towards the end of the 18th century is often referred to as the \\"First British Empire\\" by some historians. This era began with the establishment of English and later, British, overseas colonies in various parts of the world, and ended with the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America after the American War of Independence. During the 16th and 17th centuries, England, later becoming Great Britain after the Acts of Union 1707, established and expanded its colonies in the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent. Key events during this period include the founding of Jamestown in 1607, the first permanent English settlement in present-day United States, and the growth of English influence in regions such as the West Indies and India, particularly due to the activities of organizations like the British East India Company. The First British Empire saw the foundation of British imperial power through maritime trade, colonization, and military conquest. Its global reach created and facilitated the exchange of ideas, goods, and people, resulting in significant cultural, economic, and political changes throughout the territories under its control. One notable consequence was the development of the transatlantic slave trade, which played a significant role in the economic growth of the British Empire, but at the same time caused immense human suffering and has had lasting negative impacts. The era saw its end with the conclusion of the American War of Independence in 1783, when Britain recognized the independence of the United States following the Treaty of Paris. This marked the loss of the Thirteen Colonies and a significant reduction in British influence in North America. Britain's imperial focus later shifted towards Africa and Asia, particularly India, leading to what is commonly known as the \\"Second British Empire.\\" In summary, the period referred to as the \\"First British Empire\\" ended towards the end of the 18th century with the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, following the American War of Independence. This period saw the establishment and growth of British colonial power in various parts of the world and had lasting effects on the countries and cultures involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Q: In which order does the reactivity of halogen group decline? A: The answer is:","completion":"To find the order in which the reactivity of the halogen group declines, follow these steps: 1. Identify the halogen group: The halogen group consists of elements in Group 17 of the periodic table. These elements include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). 2. Analyze the periodic trends: Reactivity in the halogen group is mainly determined by the ability of the halogen atom to attract electrons to form a bond with other atoms. The larger the halogen atom, the lower its electronegativity and reactivity. As you move down the group, atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells, and electronegativity decreases. 3. Order the reactivity: Based on the periodic trends mentioned above, the reactivity of the halogen group declines in the following order: Fluorine (F) > Chlorine (Cl) > Bromine (Br) > Iodine (I) > Astatine (At) So, the order of decreasing reactivity in the halogen group is from F to At."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Pier Luigi Conti), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner.

On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor.Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into a over and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes.

The Circle, dedicated to protecting ancient artifacts and knowledge, has been active for centuries and has counted members from all over the world. Members of The Circle have been in hiding for years due to an ongoing battle with a rival group, The Terminus Order, which seeks those same artifacts for their own nefarious purposes. Upon learning this, Mark and Damien become determined to learn more about The Circle and their family's involvement. They embark on a journey to uncover long-lost secrets and protect their family legacy. As they travel, Damien begins to uncover his hidden talents, passed down from generations of Circle members.

What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a 3 out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","completion":"\\"An echidna is gnawing on a towel.\\" Explanation: This sentence draws a 3 out of 5 similarity to the original sentence (\\"A hedgehog is biting at a blanket.\\") for several reasons. First, the structure of the sentence is nearly identical. They both begin with an article (\\"A\\"/\\"An\\") followed by an animal, a linking verb (\\"is\\"), a verb related to biting (\\"biting\\" / \\"gnawing\\"), a preposition (\\"at\\" / \\"on\\"), an article (\\"a\\"), and a noun related to a textile or fabric (\\"blanket\\" / \\"towel\\"). Second, the content is also similar. Both sentences describe a small, prickly mammal engaging in the behavior of biting or gnawing on a fabric item. An echidna, like a hedgehog, is a small, spiny mammal. Here, the distinct differences between the two sentences lie within the specific choice of animal and textile. A hedgehog is not an echidna, and a blanket is not a towel, but they are close enough in nature to draw a parallel without being directly synonymous or equivalent, thus falling midway on the scale of 0 to 5. Lastly, the action of the animal in the sentence, i.e., \\"biting at\\" and \\"gnawing on\\", is not identical but similar in nature, making the sentence somewhat but not completely similar to the original sentence. While \\"biting\\" and \\"gnawing\\" might imply slightly different actions, both convey the image of the animal using its teeth to interact with the fabric object. Therefore, due to similar structure, content, and action, the sentence draws a moderate or 3 out of 5 similarity rating to the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Marianne Goldstein CBS August 10, 2007, 3:36 PM When you're about to purchase a big-ticket item such as a plasma TV, or even a fragile small item like a PDA, you're usually offered the chance to extend the manufacturer's warranty — for a fee. But is this insurance really necessary — or can it pay for itself? Do you have to sign up while you're signing on the dotted line? The Early Show's financial guru, Ray Martin, weighs the pros and cons of extended warranties. A few years ago extended warranties were only offered on costly appliances and big-ticket items. But today, these \\"protection plans\\" are offered on just about any appliance or consumer electronics products you can buy. For years, consumer advocates such as Consumer Reports have cautioned against buying extended warranties. But that advice may be in need of updating. In a recent development, many appliance makers are consolidating the terms of warranty coverage on their products to include one period covering all parts and service. The period is one year — after that, if a part wears out or breaks, you'll pay. Before this, appliance makers would have warranties with different coverage periods for various parts, ranging from five to 20 years. Now they say a simpler and clearer warranty — one that covers all parts and services for the same one-year period — will benefit consumers. The reality is that in most cases, manufacturers' warranties for many appliances will be shorter and if you want to extend the warranty coverage for periods longer than a year, you'll have to open your wallet.Shorter and \\"simpler\\" warranties for appliance brands such as Whirlpool, Roper, Estate, General Electric, Hotpoint, Maytag, Amana, Frigidaire and many other brands went into effect late last year and earlier this year. Some premium appliance brands still offer warranties that apply for longer than a year. Some consumer electronics makers have also cut their warranties. For example, according to PC World magazine, Dell used to offer a three-year warranty on numerous products — but has cut warranties on some products to just one year, and just three months on others. Once the manufacturer's warranty runs out, all costs for repairs are borne by the consumer, unless you pay for an extended warranty.Extended WarrantiesAn extended warranty typically covers the costs of repairing or replacing an item during the same period when the manufacturer's warranty runs — and extends for an additional period of time, typically two to five years from the date of purchase. Extended warranties may also cover items that are never covered by the manufacturer, such as normal wear, damage caused by a power surge, and additional services such as annual cleaning and preventative maintenance.\\"Chili Dog With Cheese\\"Anyone who buys an appliance or consumer electronics from a major retailer is likely to be asked, \\"Would you like to purchase an extended warranty with that?\\" According to reports, many large electronics retailers, such as Best Buy and Staples, encourage their salespeople to offer additional extended warranty coverage on every sale, but they don't directly pay commissions to their sales people on these. Instead, they may pay an indirect benefit, such as a team bonus for the shift that sells the most extended warranties. But sales reps are getting into the game, even having code names for the sales. According to reports, in online forums a good sale without a warranty is a \\"hot dog\\" but a good sale with an extended warranty is a \\"chili dog with cheese.\\"The feeling by some consumers that extended warranties are just an add-on to boost profits is justified. According to industry experts, the profit margins on these are often 50 percent. Also, according to Consumer Reports, when the cost of an extended warranty exceeds 20 percent of the item's purchase price, it's often not a good deal for the consumer because the cost of the warranty is not likely to be less than the cost of a typical repair. When Wal-Mart enters the market for anything, the rules of the game can change. Wal-Mart now offers extended warranties that kick in only after the manufacturer's warranty expires, so there is no overlap. According to sampling by Warranty Week, Wal-Mart's extra coverage on consumer electronics costs about six to nine percent of the purchase price — versus 15 to 25 percent at the large electronics retailers. Because of the lower cost for the extra coverage on items purchased at Wal-Mart, buying the extended warranty may be worth it.A Better Bet on Some Products If you are thinking that the decision of whether or not to pay for an extended warranty is similar to buying insurance you may never need, you are not alone. The point is that the product you buy may never need a repair at all, so paying for an extended warranty can feel like throwing money away. But some products are more likely than others to need repairs within the first three years from date of purchase. Below is a list of products and repair rates from Consumer Reports:Product Repair RateDesktop PC 37%Laptop PC 33%Refrigerator 28%Washing Machine 22%Projection TV 16%Vacuum Cleaner 13%Dishwasher 13%Clothes Dryer 13%Microwave Oven 12%Camcorder 8%Digital Camera 8%(Source: Consumer Reports Annual Questionnaire, based on three-year-old products.)Missing on the list above are LCD and Plasma TV sets. Given that these are relatively new products (particularly plasma TVs), there is not yet enough data to determine the odds of needing a repair in the first three years. With the cost of an extended warranty for these products equaling approximately the costs of a repair, it may be prudent to consider buying the extra warranty coverage, particularly if the coverage is less than 20 percent of the cost of the item. Also, if you will use the item for your small business and quick repairs are important, buying an extended warranty with additional repair coverage may be worth it. But consumers don't need to make the decision to buy extended warranty coverage at the point of purchase and under pressure. Many retailers allow 30 days after the purchases to make a decision to buy the extra coverage.Who Buys Extended WarrantiesAccording to Warranty Week, consumers spent more than 16 billion on extended warranties last year. In a PC World survey of consumers who bought products from many retailers, including Best Buy, Circuit City and Dell, about 63 percent said they had bought extended warranties and on average 71 percent of these consumers are glad they purchased the extended warranty coverage. Of the 37 percent who said they did not buy an extended warranty, only 23 percent said they regretted it and wished they had bought one when their product failed after the manufacturers warranty expired.What to Know Before You BuyBefore you buy extended warranty coverage, here's what to think about: Copyright 2007 CBS.

OPT: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(b). yes Indeed, the questions \\"What TV series are worth watching?\\" and \\"Which TV series are worth watching?\\" essentially have the same meaning. Both are open-ended questions seeking for suggestions of notable or highly-recommended television series to watch. Additionally, both use interrogative words that are often used interchangeably ('what' and 'which'). Nonetheless, while the central meaning is the same, there's a slight difference in connotation. 'What’ is usually used when there is an unlimited number of possible answers, as it presents a more general inquiry. So, when you ask 'What TV series are worth watching?', it means you are open to hearing about any TV series that the respondent feels is worth watching, regardless of genre, broadcast year, or platform. On the other hand, 'Which' is typically used when the number of options is limited, either by previous conversation or context. This implies a narrower, more specific choice. For instance, if you are having a conversation about HBO and Netflix TV series and you asked, ‘Which TV shows are worth watching?', this means you are only interested in hearing about TV series from HBO or Netflix. On the contrary, in most (if not all) contexts, the two questions will be taken to mean exactly the same thing. Audience will understand you're seeking suggestions for television series and will respond accordingly—with their suggestions and personal preferences, typically not limited by any specific subset unless previously stated in the context. Let's recommend some TV series! Some perennial fan favorites across different genres include: 1. Drama: \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Breaking Bad\\", \\"The Wire\\", \\"Mad Men\\", and \\"Game of Thrones\\". 2. Comedy: \\"The Office (US)\\", \\"Parks and Recreation\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\\", and \\"The Big Bang Theory\\". 3. Fantasy/Sci-fi: \\"Stranger Things\\", \\"The Witcher\\", \\"The Mandalorian\\", \\"Doctor Who\\", and \\"The Expanse\\". 4. Crime/Thriller: \\"Sherlock\\", \\"The Crown\\", \\"Better Call Saul\\", \\"Money Heist\\", and \\"Mindhunter\\". 5. Animation: \\"Rick and Morty\\", \\"Bojack Horseman\\", \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Adventure Time\\", and \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\". Remember that taste in television series is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. Consider what genres and styles appeal to you most, as well as other factors like series length, critical reception, and the impressions from early episodes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. I am facing a new situation today: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had a less dependable food supply available? A:","completion":"The village that likely had a less dependable food supply would be Village A. To justify my answer, let's refer to the information provided in the background article and the situation: 1. Human beings invented agriculture around 10,000 years ago. This would have allowed them to have a larger, more dependable food supply. 2. Village A existed approximately 12,000 years ago. This would mean that it existed before the invention of agriculture. 3. Therefore, it can be inferred that Village A likely relied on hunting and gathering, which is a less dependable food supply compared to agriculture. 4. Village B, on the other hand, existed around 6,000 years ago. This is well into the period after the invention of agriculture, indicating that this settlement likely had access to consistent agriculture and therefore a more dependable food supply. By using the knowledge acquired from the background article and applying it to the situations of both villages, we can conclude that Village A likely had a less dependable food supply than Village B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he \\"was upset.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

În democraţiile cu tradiţie din Occident este de neconceput ca un politician să rămână pe acelaşi post dacă imaginea sa este afectată în vreun fel. Translate to English English:","completion":"In Western democracies with established traditions, it is unthinkable for a politician to remain in the same position if their image is tarnished in any way. In Western democracies, which have a long-standing history of upholding democratic values and treating every citizen in a fair and transparent manner, it is absolutely inconceivable for a political figure to continue occupying their position if their reputation suffers any sort of setback or damage. The foundations of these democracies are largely built on the principles of openness, trust, and accountability, all of which are essential for their proper functioning and continued success. A political leader's image and reputation are critical aspects of their ability to effectively govern and make sound decisions on behalf of the people they represent. If a politician is embroiled in a scandal, is found to have lied, or has been involved in any conduct that is considered unethical or morally dubious, public confidence in their integrity and ability to lead will be significantly eroded. As a result, their positions, policies, and decisions come under increased scrutiny, leading to a general decline in the overall stability and credibility of the government or political party they belong to. In times when the trust between a politician and the public is compromised, it is crucial for the political leader in question to either step down from their post voluntarily or be removed through legal means such as impeachment or a vote of no confidence. This is because the essence of democracy lies in the will of the people and the understanding that those who are elected to serve should be accountable for their actions. A politician who remains in office despite evidence of misconduct or a damaged reputation is essentially undermining the core democratic principles that constitute the foundation of such political systems. Moreover, preserving political integrity and reputation is also vital in order to maintain productive diplomatic relations with other countries and international institutions. A leader with a tarnished image is likely to experience difficulties in negotiations, alliances, and forming partnerships on the global stage, as they may be perceived as untrustworthy or unreliable. This can hinder a country's ability to effectively address issues of international concern, ranging from trade and economic collaboration to security and climate change. In conclusion, the idea of a politician remaining in the same position with a tarnished image is entirely unacceptable in Western democracies with long-standing traditions. Upholding the principles of transparency, trust, and accountability is of the utmost importance for the continued stability and success of any democratic system. When the reputation of a political leader is in question, it is crucial for the democratic process to ensure that the individual is held accountable, either through resignation or legal removal from their post, in order to preserve the integrity of the system and continue serving the best interests of the people."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Fact 1: Burning wood is used to produce heat.

In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams. - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas. - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava. - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy. - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Pogromni Volcano is a stratovolcano on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands . Near it are 5 cinder cones , and a mountain called Pogromni 's Sister . Pogromni is old and eroded with a single glacier on its flank and base . Eruptions have been attributed to it in 1795 , 1796 , 1826 , 1827 , and 1830 , but historic eruptions attributed to it may have come from nearby Westdahl volcano . The volcano 's name comes from the Russian , meaning \`\` characterised by violent outbreak . '' This naming refers to a volcanic eruption , but shares the same etymology as pogrom , a Russian word referring to violent riots against an ethnic group . - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - Tephra is fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size or emplacement mechanism. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations.

Step 2: Simplify the equation and solve for h. Let's start with Step 1: We need to isolate the term with the variable (h) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will first move the constant term (-2332) to the other side of the equation by adding 2332 to both sides. -3*h - 2332 + 2332 = -2320 + 2332 Now, the equation will look like: -3*h = 12 Next, we'll move to Step 2: To solve for h, we need to get rid of the coefficient of h, which in this case is -3. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -3.

However, there is no explicit information given about whether Tom paid the person who took the exam on his behalf or not. There are multiple scenarios that can be derived from the given information, but we can only speculate on these situations as we do not have concrete evidence. It is possible that Tom did pay the person he hired, as many individuals would expect some form of compensation for completing a task like taking an exam for someone else. Alternatively, Tom could have promised to pay the person later, after the exam results were confirmed. Additionally, we must consider the possibility that the person who took the exam did so as a favor to Tom and did not require payment.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read the text and answer the questions. Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. 1.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture? from the following article ? The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some...","completion":"The answer to the question is \\"Brown.\\" The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Percy Brown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The perturbation of improper classification of cans would indirectly impact a step of the process in recycling more aluminum cans. When cans are not properly classified, it means that aluminum cans may be mixed with other types of cans or materials that have different recycling processes. This may cause complications during the melting process, as different materials have different melting points and may not blend well together. Moreover, impurities can adversely affect the quality of the resulting recycled aluminum, potentially making it less suitable for use in new products. The indirect impact comes into play because improper classification does not directly stop a specific step in the recycling process. However, it makes the overall process less effective and efficient, as additional resources and energy might be required to sort and separate the materials before they can be properly recycled. This could lead to increased costs, reduced recycling rates, and lower overall production of recycled aluminum cans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But there could be another significant factor at work. During the heyday of The X-Files alien conspiracy mania was mainstream. Independence Day used the Roswell incident of 1947 as a key plot point and Men in Black suggested constant alien cover-ups while a supposed alien autopsy aired in prime time. It was hip and cool to know the various plots associated with \\"the grays \\" and when the Lindsay Lohan vehicle I Know Who Killed Me cast radio show host Art Bell (of the conspiracy-themed Coast to Coast show) as himself it played like an attempt at an in-joke for cool kids. These days however the most prominent talker about aliens and secret plots is no longer Bell who kept things relatively apolitical on-air and is a centrist Libertarian. It's now Alex Jones a Trump supporter and peddler of doomsday supply wares. Jones whose conspiracy-mongering actually prompted NASA to deny they were hiding child slaves on Mars is also known for more politically targeted rants like the government turning children gay Barack Obama being the head of ISIS and the Sandy Hook massacre being faked to help facilitate a government gun grab. Jones and his contributors also have issues with \\"anti-white racism \\" all while a separate school of thought has emerged that tales of ancient aliens are racist as they assume ancient civilizations of color like the Egyptians could only have come up with the pyramids and such by getting outside help from a more advanced race. Throw into that mix the \\"birther\\" theories that were all the rage during the Obama presidency -- promoted by our current president -- that the chief executive was some kind of secret Kenyan Muslim usurper and you start to get a picture of what conspiracy theorists look like in today's media. Being into aliens and cover-ups is less associated now with young and sexy TV stars and more the domain of aggrieved middle-aged men. X-Files creator Chris Carter is clearly having none of that though given the overall storylines of the show he seems at the very least to be inspired by a favorite left-wing conspiracy notion of contaminated vaccines. A montage of the achievements of archvillain Carl \\"Cigarette-Smoking Man\\" Busch includes a whole lot of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon (masterful timing it turned out as the spat between those two was making headlines almost simultaneously) as well as a line about how people are easier to fool now because they don't believe in science (cough... GlobalWarming... cough cough) and don't know what fake news is. Meanwhile our heroes remain FBI agents who in the minds of Alex Jones devotees would be considered part of the anti-Trump \\"Deep State.\\" Jones was arguably an inspiration for Joel McHale's YouTube host character in season 10 and written semi-sympathetically...but that was January of 2016 when nobody assumed the election would go the way it did or that Jones would get a big thumbs-up from candidate Trump. In an episode that also definitively stated the moon landing was faked and that Busch is definitely the father of two very significant characters we also caught hints of two different conspiracies at war with one another. Their most obvious point of disagreement on the show is whether Dana Scully should live or die -- but in real life they may be representative of the Art Bell and Alex Jones wings of Conspiracystan. We get a strong sense of what side Carter is on...but the low ratings suggest that those who pore over cover-ups and aliens nowadays may no longer feel politically simpatico with the creator. Or perhaps they can just go to any corner of the Internet and find similarly intricate stories many of which are shared as memes on Facebook by that uncle who turns out to have been a lot crazier than you ever suspected. Even as Jones semi-admitted in court that he's playing a character akin to of all things Jack Nicholson's Joker I've seen family members share his stories about a coming race war with utter seriousness.

Equally important is to assess the debt management plan's (DMP) structure and review the debt payment strategies provided. A well-designed DMP should consolidate your unsecured debt into a single, affordable monthly payment while taking into account your financial capabilities as well as the payment timeline. The program you choose should also offer ongoing support during your debt repayment journey, providing access to experienced and certified credit counselors who can offer guidance on budgeting, financial planning, and debt reduction. As you compare different programs, pay close attention to the program fees and associated costs. While reputable organizations will often charge a nominal fee for their services, exorbitant or hidden fees should raise a red flag. Be wary of companies that ask for considerable upfront payments or have a fee structure that seems unclear or complicated. Moreover, make sure to read the fine print and understand the program's terms and conditions, specifically, the program's impact on your credit score and any guarantees offered by the company. A well-established debt management program should work closely with your creditors to negotiate reduced interest rates, waive late fees, and help rebuild your credit over time. However, keep in mind that each individual's circumstances are different, so don't fall for unrealistic promises or \\"quick-fix\\" solutions that may not necessarily address your unique debt situation. Gather recommendations from friends, family members, and online reviews to learn about other consumers' experiences with the debt management programs you are considering. By using these firsthand testimonials you can gain insight into how effective and reliable these programs are in helping people manage their debt. In conclusion, making a debt management program work for you involves diligent research, recommendations, and a thorough evaluation of the program's accreditations, fees, DMP structure, credit counselor expertise, and consumer success stories. By carefully considering these factors and making an informed decision, you can confidently choose a debt management program that best fits your needs and paves a smooth path toward financial freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: V5C log books record a car's \\"registered keeper\\". However, in some cases they are not being updated for several months after cars are sold, a BBC investigation has found. Some dealers retain the documents to help them qualify for large discounts from car manufacturers. The National Franchised Dealers Association describe the findings as \\"concerning\\" and say bonuses linked to sales might \\"incentivise\\" the activity. The cars affected are \\"pre-registered,\\" excess stock sold cheaply by manufacturers to dealers. They must legally be kept off-road for 90 days before being re-sold. The delays can be even longer if the car was originally registered by a retailer as a business fleet vehicle. However, in some cases the cars are delivered to new buyers immediately, while the vehicles remain registered at a separate address, an investigation by BBC Radio 4's You and Yours has found. Many of the cars are sold on by online car brokers. They commonly disclose the disadvantages in their terms and conditions, explaining that the vehicles will be registered to customers \\"in due course\\". However, many customers fail to read the small print and some suffer the consequences. \\"I couldn't drive the car because it had been declared off-road\\", said buyer Andrew March. \\"The car log book had been withheld so I couldn't re-tax it.\\" After asking repeatedly for his logbook, motorist James Laddie applied to the DVLA for a new one. The three-month delay proved expensive: \\"The council would not transfer our old parking permit to the new car without proof of ownership. The combined cost of parking tickets was about Â£200.\\" Experts stress that there can be potentially more serious consequences of a driver and their car being registered to different addresses. For example, police speed camera fines are sent to the postal address linked via DVLA records to a car's registration plate. One driver who spoke to You and Yours lived in London while his car remained registered for several months in Bolton. Insurance companies also require drivers to disclose both the owner and the registered keeper of a vehicle. Roy Rodger, an expert on insurance law who has trained underwriters, warns that drivers' confusion over withheld log books could lead to costly mistakes. \\"In a situation where a driver misled the insurance company over registration details and a serious accident occurred, the driver could be in a very, very awkward position. \\"They could have to pay the claim out of their own pocket eventually,\\" he said. The Association of British Insurers told You and Yours it was not aware of any cases where this had happened, but added that drivers should inform motor insurers if they are not the registered keeper. The practice of log books being retained by third party suppliers was highlighted in a 2012 court case brought against a competitor by online car broker Richard Sanders, founder of Drive the Deal. The competitor had not adequately warned consumers of the risks involved. Although Mr Sanders won the case, he says the industry has not been fully cleaned up. \\"We decided to start looking at this because we were very concerned indeed about the trouble that some consumers would get themselves into,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately I think the practice of wrongly registering cars on purpose does continue.\\" The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, says she is very concerned by the findings. \\"As dealers are required to keep vehicles for 90 days to qualify for some bonuses, that could incentivise this type of activity,\\" she said. Autocar editorial director, Jim Holder, says transparency in the car industry has improved but problems remain. \\"This part of the industry is poorly regulated and there are still traders out there who ignore the rules,\\" he said. \\"It's not really a problem that the industry takes seriously and it's really only word of mouth and education that can stop this.\\" You and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00 GMT.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Cameron was born in 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley (nee Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron, an electrical engineer. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. Context: In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled \\"Project 880\\" (now known to be Avatar) in parallel with another project, Alita: Battle Angel (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar. However, in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film Avatar first. He mentioned that if both films were successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both. Alita: Battle Angel eventually began production in 2016 with Cameron writing and producing and Robert Rodriguez directing. Avatar had an estimated budget of over 300 million and was released on December 18, 2009. This marked his first feature film since 1997's Titanic. It is composed almost entirely of computer-generated animation, using a more-advanced version of the \\"performance capture\\" technique used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express. James Cameron had written an 80-page scriptment for Avatar in 1995 and announced in 1996 that he would make the film after completing Titanic. In December 2006, Cameron explained that the delay in producing the film since the 1990s had been to wait until the technology necessary to create his project was advanced enough, since at the time no studio would finance for the development of the visual effects. The film was originally scheduled to be released in May 2009 but was pushed back to December 2009 to allow more time for post-production on the complex CGI and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron originally intended Avatar to be 3D-only. Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed 749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's Titanic. Avatar also became the first movie to ever earn more than 2 billion worldwide. Including revenue from the re-release of Avatar featuring extended footage, it grossed 760.5 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.78 billion worldwide. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. Avatar's success made Cameron the highest earner in Hollywood for 2010, netting him 257 million as reported by Vanity Fair. Disney announced in September 2011 that it would adapt James Cameron's film Avatar into Pandora-The World of Avatar, a themed area at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Question: what is james ole in avrtar. Whats the answer?","completion":"James Cameron's role in Avatar is that he is the director, writer, and producer of the movie. He created the story, helped make the movie, and was in charge of the whole project.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: The Public Theater has confirmed that Edward Snowden will guest star in every performance of Privacy via a pre-recorded video. The co-production with Donmar Warehouse is inspired by a post-Snowden view on privacy and technology, and encourages the use of cell phones during the show. Snowden made international headlines in 2013 when he copied and leaked classified National Security Agency documents. His actions shed light on issues of government secrecy and surveillance and fueled worldwide debates on the matter of informational privacy. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Privacy will begin performances July 2 and officially open July 18. The boundary-pushing work is co-created by James Graham and Josie Rourke, and is set to play through August 14 in the Public's Newman Theater. Daniel Radcliffe Says Audience Can Email Him During Privacy Radcliffe stars as “The Writer” and is joined by fellow cast members De’Adre Aziza, Raffi Barsoumian, Michael Countryman, Rachel Dratch and Reg Rogers, playing an ensemble of real-life politicians, journalists and technologists who have all contributed to the show. Here’s how the theatre bills the new play: “Privacy explores our complicated relationship with technology and data through the funny and heart-breaking travails of a lonely guy (Radcliffe), who arrives in the city to figure out how to like, tag, and share his life without giving it all away. The play uncovers what our technological choices reveal about who we are, what we want and who’s keeping track of it all. This provocative theatrical event will ask audiences to charge their phones, leave them ON during the performance and to embark on a fascinating dive online and into a new reality where we’re all connected…for better or worse.” Tickets are available by calling (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, or in person at the Taub Box Office at The Public Theater at 425 Lafayette Street, Manhattan. ||||| Be not afeard, indeed. In a clandestine confab, artists from the Public Theater and the Donmar Warehouse on Saturday met in the Lower Manhattan auditorium where “A Chorus Line” and “Hamilton” began so the actor Daniel Radcliffe (in the flesh) and the fugitive Edward J. Snowden (by video from Moscow) could run lines of Shakespeare. The odd mash-up, three years in the making, produced one of the more unusual cameos of the moment: beginning this weekend, Mr. Snowden will appear in a new play at the Public, conjured up nightly to exchange bits of “The Tempest” and ideas about privacy with Mr. Radcliffe, who plays a writer in the show. The interview/performance was a long-sought goal of the creators of “Privacy,” a British play, rewritten with an American context, that begins performances Saturday and explores how the personal has become public in the digital age. The play was conceived shortly before Mr. Snowden burst into public view, but his leaking of government documents shaped the drama. “Privacy” is a work of documentary theater, in which actors speak words taken from interviews the writers conducted with politicians, scholars and journalists. The show’s creators, James Graham and Josie Rourke, tried repeatedly to reach Mr. Snowden — they were not successful before the London production in 2014. But Mr. Snowden is now on a bit of a remote-controlled publicity tear (he has even made appearances via robot), and last week his lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union said he would do it. |||||","completion":"Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who leaked classified National Security Agency documents in 2013, is set to guest star in every performance of Privacy at the Public Theater via a pre-recorded video.

Taking a road trip across the United States offers a unique and unparalleled experience for travelers as they get to witness the country's breathtaking natural beauty, experience its rich culture, and immerse themselves in its fascinating history. The United States spans across a large geographical area that encompasses 50 states and numerous prominent cities, each with its distinct character, attractions, and appeal. One of the factors that contribute immensely to making the United States an ideal destination for a road trip is its extensive and well-developed network of highways that connect different cities and regions, allowing for smooth and convenient travel. Moreover, many of these highways provide awe-inspiring views and lead to some of the most iconic attractions in the country, such as national parks, landmarks, and monuments. Travelling across the United States on a road trip not only opens up the opportunity for visiting famous destinations like New York City, Los Angeles, or Chicago but also presents the chance to dive deep into the lesser-known, off-the-beaten-path attractions like small towns, hidden gem beaches, or quaint villages. This way, travelers can gain a more authentic and comprehensive understanding of the American way of life and its multitude of cultures, cuisines, and traditions. The other options mentioned, such as atlas, countryside, between two cities, and repairs, do not adequately explain or justify the reason behind choosing the United States as their road trip destination. An atlas is simply a tool, often in the form of a book or a digital map, that provides geographical information about various places, including the United States. While an atlas may come in handy for planning the road trip, it alone cannot be the destination. The countryside, although it does evoke images of scenic landscapes and picturesque settings, is a vague term that could apply to rural areas in any country. It is not specific enough to justify the road trip across the United States. \\"Between two cities\\" might describe a more limited road trip, but it does not capture the scope of a cross-country journey encompassing multiple states and highways throughout the United States. Lastly, \\"repairs\\" seems wholly unrelated to the question, as it pertains to the maintenance or fixing of something, potentially a vehicle, but does not answer where they plan to travel on their road trip. In conclusion, the answer is \\"United States\\" because the extensive network of highways connecting its various cities, towns, and natural attractions makes it an ideal destination for a road trip, allowing travelers to witness the country's incredible diversity, distinct cultural experiences, and stunning landscapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - Ahoy ! was a magazine published between January 1984 and January 1989 that focused on all Commodore International color computers , but especially the Commodore 64 and Amiga . It was noted for the quality and learnability of its type - in program listings . - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.

Q: If I tell you that Beads of liquid are formed by vapor condensing, and ask you the question \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\", is the correct answer \\"energy barrier\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"energy barrier.\\" If the question being asked is \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\", the correct answer is \\"vapor condensing.\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the process of vapor condensing to form beads of liquid: 1. The process begins with vapor, which is a substance in its gaseous state, typically at a temperature that is well above its boiling point. Common examples of vapor include steam, which is water vapor, or the fumes produced by volatile substances such as gasoline and alcohol. 2. When the surrounding temperature decreases or the pressure increases, the vapor starts to cool down considerably. As it cools, the particles within the vapor begin to lose their kinetic energy, and the attractive forces between these particles start to dominate. 3. As a result of this shift in dominant forces, the particles come closer together, and the vapor begins to transform into a liquid state. This process is called condensation. 4. Beads of liquid are formed as a result of vapor condensing on a nearby object or surface. This can be observed as dew or water droplets on cold surfaces such as a windowpane or a mirror. The formation of beads is due to the surface tension between the attracted molecules in the liquid state, which prevents the droplets from spreading out and forms a round or beaded appearance. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\" is \\"vapor condensing.\\" The term \\"energy barrier\\" is not directly related to this process, as it is more pertinent to the study of chemical reactions and the activation energy threshold that must be overcome for a reaction to occur."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Translate each word separately to Russian. 3. Combine the translated words into a coherent phrase in Russian. Here's the step-by-step translation process: 1. The phrase \\"Curse of the pharaohs\\" consists of three words: \\"Curse,\\" \\"of the,\\" and \\"pharaohs\\". 2. Now, I'll translate each word individually: - \\"Curse\\" can be translated as \\"проклятие\\" (proklyatiye) in Russian. - \\"of the\\" is a grammatical construction, so it doesn't have a direct translation. In Russian, this construction can be expressed using the genitive case, so I will decline the noun \\"pharaohs\\" accordingly. - \\"pharaohs\\" can be translated as \\"фараонов\\" (faraonov) in Russian, because the genitive form of \\"фараон\\" (farаon) is \\"фараонов\\" (faraonov), which signifies possession. 3. Combining the translated words into a coherent phrase in Russian: \\"проклятие фараонов\\" (proklyatiye faraonov).

Information: - Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research .

To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your answer? Which of these is a nonliving thing? Choose from: (1). a mushroom. (2). a tree. (3). a worm. (4). a river.","completion":"Option (4), a river, is the nonliving thing among the choices provided. To gain a deeper understanding, it's essential to differentiate between living and nonliving things with respect to their features and characteristics. (1) A mushroom: Although they may not resemble other traditional living organisms such as plants or animals, mushrooms are indeed alive. They are classified as fungi, which is its own separate kingdom different from plants, animals, and bacteria. Fungi obtain nutrients by breaking down and consuming dead organic matter, playing a crucial role in the decomposition process. Unlike plants, they lack chlorophyll and cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis. However, they exhibit other characteristics of living organisms, such as growing, cellular organization, and the ability to respond to stimuli. (2) A tree: Trees belong to the plant kingdom and are living organisms. They possess all the characteristics of living beings, such as growth, reproduction, cellular organization, metabolism, and response to stimuli. Trees also produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis, which involves converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Furthermore, trees have a vital role in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, thus contributing to the maintenance of earth's ecosystem. (3) A worm: Worms are considered living organisms belonging to the animal kingdom. They are multicellular invertebrates with a simple body structure, typically long and cylindrical. Worms possess specialized cells for various life functions such as digestion, excretion, and reproduction. They exhibit movement and the ability to respond to their environment, finding food and escaping from predators. Different types of worms, like earthworms, play a crucial role in improving soil quality by breaking down dead organic matter, aerating the soil, and enhancing soil fertility. (4) A river: A river is a nonliving thing, as it is a body of flowing water and lacks the characteristics and features of a living organism. Rivers have a significant role in shaping the earth's surface, providing habitats for various living organisms, and serving as essential sources of water. They are formed through constant movement of water due to gravity, which causes water to flow from higher elevations to lower elevations. The cycle of water in a river is influenced by various factors like precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, and human activities. Although rivers host numerous living organisms such as fish, plants, and microorganisms, they themselves are not considered alive."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added.

Recently, Roman Polanski talked about what he did on TV. This was the first time he spoke about it since he was in a special kind of \\"time-out\\" in a place called Swiss prison. A prison is like a big, locked-up house where people who did something very wrong must go to think about their mistakes and make sure they don't do them again. In the TV interview, Roman Polanski said he \\"regrets\\" doing the bad thing with the girl.

We can only learn from our mistakes and try to do better in the future. So, children, it's important to remember that everyone, even grown-ups like Roman Polanski, can make big mistakes.

The detailed and long version of this negative review could look like the following: Title: Disappointing dining experience at XYZ Restaurant I recently visited XYZ Restaurant, which was recommended to me by a friend who had raved about the delicious food and excellent service. Being a food enthusiast, I was eager to give it a try. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. In this review, I will provide a detailed account of the issues I encountered at the restaurant. Firstly, despite having booked a table in advance, we were kept waiting for 25 minutes past our reservation time. The hostess explained that they were experiencing an unusually busy night, but a simple apology would have sufficed to acknowledge our inconvenience. Once we were seated, the restaurant was too noisy and overcrowded, making it difficult to hold a conversation with my companions without raising our voices. Given that this restaurant is supposed to be one of the more upscale options in town, I was shocked by how uncomfortable the atmosphere and seating arrangements were. When it came time to place our orders, the server seemed hurried and inattentive. We asked for recommendations, but she appeared disinterested and merely pointed out the most popular dishes without providing much insight into the ingredients or preparation styles. It felt as though she was trying to rush us through the ordering process. The food itself was underwhelming. I ordered the chef's special grilled fish, which was supposed to be prepared with a special herb-infused marinade. However, the dish turned out to be dry, overcooked, and lacking in flavor. I noticed that the presentation of our dishes was also lackluster, with the plates looking haphazard and hastily assembled. Additionally, the prices at XYZ Restaurant are quite steep, considering the quality of food and service we received. I would have been happy to pay a premium price for a truly exceptional dining experience, but, in this case, I felt like the cost did not justify the product. To make matters worse, the service remained inconsistent throughout the evening. Our server was slow to refill our water glasses, and we had to ask multiple times for additional napkins and utensils. When the time came to request the bill, we were met with further delays. Overall, I cannot recommend XYZ Restaurant based on my recent visit. The numerous issues we experienced with service, food quality, ambiance, and pricing sadly overshadowed any positive aspects the restaurant may have had. I sincerely hope that the management takes notice of these issues and works on improving the customer experience in the future. Until then, I will be looking for better dining options elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The English Premier League, known for its international draw of star players, lucrative television rights, and loyal fan base, has attracted various American billionaires who made their fortunes with sports franchises in the United States. In recent years, these investors have expanded their global portfolios by acquiring ownership stakes in major teams such as Manchester United, owned by Malcolm Glazer, Liverpool, owned by Hicks and Gillett, and Aston Villa, owned by Randy Lerner. Stan Kroenke, owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, and Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids, may soon join this elite group of American investors in English football. This development follows the news that a major shareholder at London-based Arsenal is considering selling her stake in the club, which could provide an opportunity for Kroenke to increase his ownership and involvement in the English Premier League. While these American investors have been successful in expanding their sports empires, it is important to examine the financial impact of their investments on the clubs they have acquired. In the case of the Glazer family, who obtained ownership of Manchester United, their acquisition of the club saddled it with a significant debt. The most recent accounts show that Manchester United is more than 1 billion in debt as a result. This situation highlights the potential risks and consequences of foreign investment on football clubs. While the infusion of capital can certainly help boost a club's financial resources, enabling it to attract top talent and enhance its performance, it is crucial to ensure that the long-term financial stability of the clubs is maintained. This balance ultimately impacts not only the owners and their investments but also the clubs' dedicated fans who have supported them throughout the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jennifer's cousin, Shari Nichols Witt, reminisced about Julian King during the vigil, saying that the 7-year-old seemed \\"ahead of his time.\\" The Rev. Jesse Jackson also spoke at the vigil and expressed that the family is overwhelmed by the sudden and unexpected losses they have experienced. William Balfour, the estranged husband of Hudson's sister Julia, is considered a suspect in the shooting deaths of Jennifer Hudson's family members and remains in police custody. The 27-year-old parolee's involvement in the case highlights the ongoing issue of violent crime and the lasting impact it has on surviving family members. The Hudson-King Foundation hopes to provide much-needed support and resources for families facing similar heartrending situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mud Island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters, as it had no such problems like earthquakes that are mentioned for Woo Island. As described in the hint, earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and when stresses build too much, the rocks break, releasing the energy that was stored in them. This sudden release of energy creates an earthquake, during which rocks typically move several centimeters or, more rarely, a few meters.

General Sees Possible Cut in Troops in Iraq WASHINGTON, June 11  The top American commander in Iraq said today that United States forces in Iraq could be gradually reduced this year if the new Iraqi government made steady progress and the Iraqi Army gained in self-sufficiency. But the commander, General George W Casey Jr., did not go as far as a top Iraqi security official, who predicted today that the numbers of American troops in Iraq could fall this year from the current 130,000 to perhaps 100,000. General Casey also said that he was not surprised that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia had issued new threats following the death of its leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on Wednesday in an air raid north of Baghdad. An Internet message attributed to the group warned of \\"great operations to shake the enemy.\\" Speaking of Mr. Zarqawi's death, General Casey said, \\"It's not going to stop terrorism across Iraq, but it is a major blow both to his network and to Al Qaeda.\\" General Casey appeared on three Sunday morning news programs  all of which were broadcast before the Iraqi security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, predicted the troop cuts on CNN  and he carried a cautiously upbeat message about Mr. Zarqawi's death and its impact on his group of mostly foreign militants. \\"They are hurt badly,\\" he said. \\"But again, you can't stop terrorist attacks completely.\\" General Casey told \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that American-led forces were conducting follow-up raids informed by intelligence gathered as the coalition moved in on Mr. Zarqawi, and apparently also by names and phone numbers on computers found in the rubble of the remote house where he died. Mr. Rubaie also said Mr. Zarqawi's death could have a galvanizing effect. He predicted a splintering of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a particularly brutal group that had intimidated many Iraqis into shunning political participation. As long as the national unity government and Iraqi security forces continue to make progress, \\"I think we're going to be able to see continued gradual reductions of coalition forces over the coming months and into next year,\\" the general said on the CBS News program \\"Face the Nation.\\" General Casey noted that the Iraqi government is poised to announce a new plan to improve security around Baghdad. General Casey spoke a day before President Bush was to begin intensive consultations  on Monday with his own advisers at his Camp David retreat, and on Tuesday with the new Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki via video hookup  on strategies to bolster the Iraqi government and tangibly improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis. General Casey said he did not plan to ask Mr. Bush for more troops, but he declined to say whether he would urge any cutbacks. Bush administration officials have played down the prospect that the strategy sessions would lead to quick troop reductions. Iraqi officials like Mr. Rubaie have at times made more optimistic troop projections than those offered by American officials, who say instead that any withdrawal will depend on conditions in Iraq and the ability of Iraqi security forces to operate largely without the support of the American-led coalition. Still, congressmen seized on Mr. Rubaie's statement as offering hope. \\"That's an authoritative statement,\\" Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on CNN. \\"I think we ought to do everything we can to hold them to it.\\" But a Democratic senator, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, added a caution. \\"The reality in Iraq,\\" he said, also on CNN, \\"is that the jihadists are just a small portion of the instability.\\" Mr. Rubaie predicted that Mr. Zarqawi's death would have a \\"huge\\" impact, as Iraqis began feeling safe to take part in the political process. He also confirmed the American account of events around the militant's death. General Casey, asked about a report that one witness claimed to have seen soldiers beating a critically wounded Mr. Zarqawi, dismissed them bluntly as \\"baloney.\\" Like Mr. Rubaie, he said American troops sought to minister aid to the injured Qaeda leader, but added that it was too late. \\"He died while American soldiers were attempting to save his life,\\" General Casey said.

In Babylonian astronomy, records of the motions of the stars, planets, and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was \\"the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.\\" According to the historian A. Aaboe, \\"all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.\\" Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who wrote on the clay tablets in Babylonian astronomy?","completion":"The clay tablets in Babylonian astronomy were written by scribes.

Spa companies can range in size and scope from small local businesses to large luxury resorts that cover multiple acres. The term \\"spa\\" was originally used to refer to a place where water that is believed to have special health-giving properties was present, often in the form of hot springs or therapeutic mineral waters. However, as the wellness industry has evolved, the term has come to refer to any place that provides services meant to help the client relax, rejuvenate, beautify, or improve their physical well-being. Spa services can often include treatments from licensed professionals such as estheticians, massage therapists, and cosmetologists, who provide their services in a calm, relaxing and generally luxurious environment designed to help clients feel at ease. The word La Perla in \\"La Perla Spa\\" is Spanish and translates to \\"The Pearl\\" in English. It suggests that the company aims to provide a luxurious, precious and unique experience to its clients, one which can be compared to the beauty and rarity of a pearl. It's common for spa businesses to select names evocative of beauty, luxury, and tranquility, to enhance the sense of exclusivity and relaxation they offer.

Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine).

During the day, the coconut oil turns into a liquid state. The answer is \\"warmer,\\" which means that the daytime temperature is higher than the nighttime temperature, causing the coconut oil to change from solid to liquid. Explanation: Coconut oil has a melting point of around 76°F (24°C). When the temperature is below this point, coconut oil remains solid. When the temperature rises above the melting point, the coconut oil turns into a liquid. In this situation, the fact that the oil is solid at night and liquid during the day indicates that the daytime temperature is warmer than the nighttime temperature.

Available choices: A. no B. yes","completion":"A. No These two questions do not have the same meaning as they are addressing entirely different topics. The first question, \\"How do I kiss Emma Watson?\\" is an inquiry about the specific action of kissing the British actress Emma Watson. This question likely comes from a position of personal curiosity or fantasy and has no broader context. It is important to note that such a question may not be appropriate, as it might be perceived as invading Emma Watson's privacy, and consent should always be prioritized. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Should Emma Watson spend a week in a refugee camp?\\" is a proposal about the actress's potential involvement in an immersive experience with displaced people. This question implies a broader context, perhaps considering her record as a public advocate for social and humanitarian causes, like gender equality and education. Emma Watson's visit to a refugee camp could potentially help raise awareness about the issues refugees face, making it a question focused on activism and empathy.

One is focused on a personal desire to engage in an intimate act with the actress, while the other is about her potential to raise awareness and understanding of a global issue through direct involvement with the subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the question \\"What can be heard through the ear?\\" and the following answer choices: - matter vibrating - encoded information - mean thoughts - absence of noise - ear drums - in the frog family - electromagnetic energy - the body's largest organ Now knowing that matter vibrating can cause sound and words are only gross sounds heard through the ear, choose the best answer.","completion":"The best answer choice for the given question \\"What can be heard through the ear?\\" is \\"matter vibrating\\". This is because the sensation of hearing fundamentally relies on the vibrations of matter, such as air molecules, which then transmit these vibrations to our auditory system through the ear. The process begins when a source of sound creates vibrations that travel through a medium, most commonly air. These vibrations are called sound waves and are detected by our ear system. The outer ear is specifically designed to capture sound waves and guide them through the ear canal, which then causes the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations then continue through the middle ear, where they are transmitted by a series of tiny bones called ossicles, which amplify the vibrations and transmit them to the inner ear. In the inner ear, the cochlea transforms the mechanical vibrations into electrical impulses, which are sent along the auditory nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as sounds. To provide clarity to the other answer choices: - Encoded information refers to a form of coded data or signal, which is not what the ear directly perceives; it can only become audible if there is some form of matter vibrating. - Mean thoughts, although they require our ears to hear and our brain to process, only exist on an abstract level and cannot be directly transmitted as sound. - Absence of noise is not something the ear can specifically hear; rather, it represents the lack of sound or an environment devoid of vibrations. - Ear drums are involved in the hearing process but are not by themselves audible to an individual. - In the frog family is irrelevant to the question since it's not related to what can be heard through the ear. - Electromagnetic energy refers to energy in the form of photons or electromagnetic waves, which is not detected by the ear but instead by other sensory receptors, such as our eyes. - The body's largest organ refers to the skin, which is unrelated to this question as the skin is not responsible for the sense of hearing. Taking all this into account, matter vibrating is the most accurate, logical, and comprehensive answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, he must race against time to decode the encrypted secrets buried within him and thwart the dark forces that threaten not just his career but the fate of the world. Act 1: Cristiano Ronaldo, a global soccer icon, leads his team to another spectacular victory. As a customary celebration, his friends and teammates organize a lavish dinner in his honor. Little does he know that an undercover agent from a clandestine organization infiltrates the party with a devious plan: implant a top-secret, highly-sophisticated chip-device into Ronaldo's food in an attempt to smuggle sensitive intelligence across international borders undetected. As fate would have it, Ronaldo swallows the tiny device, completely unaware of the magnitude of the scheme now resting in his stomach. Act 2: Days later, Ronaldo begins to experience unexplained symptoms like dizziness, migraines, and fainting spells, ultimately resulting in unwanted attention from the press and a potential threat to his flourishing sports career. Worried about his health, he consults a doctor who, after finding the chip in an X-ray, contacts his close friend and cyber-security expert, Dr. Maria Alves. Together, Maria and Ronaldo learn the hard truth: an elite criminal syndicate is behind the dangerous embedded device. Believing Ronaldo would be nothing more than a courier, the shadowy organization, known as \\"The Scarlets,\\" now sets its sights on retrieving the chip – a feat only possible if Ronaldo loses his life in the process. As word comes that The Scarlets have put a bounty on his head, the pair sets out on a quest to uncover the device's secrets, which appear to hold the key to a malicious plot capable of destabilizing nations and overthrowing world leaders. Act 3: With Dr. Maria Alves' tech prowess, profound knowledge of espionage, and her ability to decipher encrypted data, the duo understands the chilling reality that The Scarlets are planning a synchronized, global cyber-attack dubbed \\"Project Ragnarok.\\" Ronaldo, now more than just a sports icon, becomes an unlikely hero, using his celebrity status and connections to infiltrate the criminal underworld. The pair discovers hidden ties that connect The Scarlets to high-ranking officials in various world governments, exposing the depth of the conspiracy. Disquietingly, Ronaldo now faces the ultimate decision – prioritizing his prosperous career or subjecting himself to a dangerous and unorthodox surgery to remove the chip and save humanity. In the thrilling finale, Ronaldo decides to sacrifice his sports career, braving the risky surgery to extract the chip from his abdomen. With time running out and the imminent cyber-attack looming closer, Maria utilizes the information decrypted from the chip, dismantling Project Ragnarok and foiling The Scarlets' evil aspirations.

Given the following context: The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&M Studios in Los Angeles: \\"It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.\\" The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. The legal disputes were resolved out-of-court by the end of 1987. answer the following question: What was the name of the person who applied to the High Court?

And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it.\\" \\"All this is just so new,\\" said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. \\"I did not have much time to talk with him. We just have a lot of things to do and I cannot talk anymore. We need a little time to evaluate all this.\\" The governor of Somalia's Mudug region, Ahmed Muse, told CNN that local elders negotiated Moore's release, adding that the journalist is \\"physically and mentally\\" worn out. Moore boarded a plane at an airport in Galkayo, in the north-central part of Somalia, Muse said. Muse would not say where the journalist is headed. \\"I'm absolutely thrilled,\\" said Michel Todd, who was Moore's web editor at Pacific Standard magazine. \\"It's like seeing somebody come back from the dead. It's a marvelous resurrection.\\" Todd said Moore was a weekly freelance columnist who wrote often about Somalia. He had been researching Somali pirates. \\"As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture,\\" Todd said. \\"But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult.\\" Todd said Moore's stories suggested that illegal European fishing was driving Somalis into piracy. \\"Of all the people for the pirates to nab,\\" he said. \\"He wasn't necessarily a spokesman, but he was someone who was more amenable to getting (the pirates') point across. I'm not saying he was pro-pirate, but he was pro-truth and that seemed like something that might have been helpful to Somalis.\\" Maria Streshinsky, editor of Pacific Standard, said, \\"We are thrilled, but it has been really far too long. It's been such a worrisome situation. We are just elated. We may have a toast and a beer in his honor.

PSmag.com claims to reach nearly one million readers each month with research-based articles about the social sciences, Moore's mother declined to comment when asked if a ransom was paid for her son. Muse said he did not know if a ransom was paid. In lawless Somalia, it's common -- particularly among pirates -- that people are kidnapped and their freedom negotiated for ransom. The pirates operate in the Gulf of Aden, one of the globe's most trafficked shipping waterways. The U.S. State Department confirmed in January 2012 that officials had spoken with Moore's family and been in touch with contacts in Kenya and Somalia to get more information. The department noted at the time that a travel warning for Somalia cautioned U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to the country and recommended avoiding it.

Germany's Foreign Ministry confirmed \\"that a German citizen, who also possesses American citizenship and who was kidnapped in Somalia, was freed today.\\" Moore, 45, is said to be in good condition considering the circumstances, security officials said. They said that he was overjoyed to be free. On Tuesday, Moore arrived in the Somali capital in a small airplane and was taken to a safe place for a medical and psychological examination. Moore was abducted in January 2012 in the Somali city of Galkayo, where he was doing research for a book on piracy. In the ensuing years of his captivity, his kidnappers released periodic photos of Moore. The Foreign Ministry's crisis team together with American officials worked intensively to secure Moore's release during the length of his captivity. Several different negotiators were involved over the two-and-a-half year period. Following Moore's release, SPIEGEL Editor-in-Chief Wolfgang Büchner thanked all those involved in working on behalf of the journalist during his captivity. \\"We never gave up hope and are now rejoicing with Michael and his family that this nightmare has finally come to an end,\\" Büchner said in Hamburg. \\"We're grateful to all the people who have worked so long to bring about Michael's release -- and thrilled that he and his family can be reunited at last,\\" said Jon Sawyer, executive director of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Moore was reporting on a Pulitzer Center grant at the time of his abduction. ||||| MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Negotiators paid a 1.6 million ransom for the release of a German-American journalist who was kidnapped in Somalia and held for two years and eight months, a commander of pirates who held him said Wednesday. Michael Scott Moore was \\"doing well\\" and receiving medical care, Germany's Foreign Ministry said. Moore, 45, was flown to Kenya's capital after being freed in Somalia on Tuesday. A special German Foreign Ministry crisis group and German federal police had worked \\"very closely\\" with U.S. authorities to win Moore's freedom after he was kidnapped on Jan. 21, 2012, while researching a book on piracy, foreign ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli told The Associated Press in Berlin. \\"Given the circumstances, he's doing well,\\" Chebli said. She would not comment on what led to his release or on reports that a ransom had been paid, beyond saying \\"the German government cannot be blackmailed.\\" The Somali pirates negotiated with Somali intermediaries acting on behalf of Germany, Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the coastal town of Hobyo, told AP. He said pirates grew tired of holding Moore and were increasingly concerned the U.S. would attempt to use force to secure the journalist's freedom. Just four days after Moore was kidnapped in the northern Somali town of Galkayo as he was driving from the airport, U.S. Navy SEALs rescued an American and a Dane in a nighttime raid while killing all nine of their guards. The two had also been kidnapped in Galkayo, on Oct. 25, 2011. Moore had freelanced for Germany's Der Spiegel. He holds both German and American citizenship and is a native of Redondo Beach, California Chebli said Moore was at the German Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Wednesday. German officials there denied Moore was present. ___ Rising reported from Berlin. AP journalist Ben Curtis contributed to this report from Nairobi, Kenya. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"American journalist Michael Scott Moore, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates in January 2012, has been released after over two years in captivity. Moore, who frequently wrote about Somalia and was researching Somali pirates at the time of his abduction, is said to be in good condition though physically and mentally worn out. His release was confirmed by his mother and a Somali official. The negotiation for his freedom was handled by local elders in Somalia's Mudug region. The Governor of the region, Ahmed Muse, stated that Moore is exhausted and did not disclose where he was headed after boarding a plane in Galkayo, Somalia. Reactions to his release from his family and colleagues have been ecstatic, with many expressing relief that he is finally safe. Despite many questions surrounding the event, both Moore's mother and Muse declined to comment on whether a ransom was paid for his release. This was later revealed by a commander of the pirates who held Moore that negotiators paid a 1.6 million ransom for his release."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised.

As an academic field, philosophy of education is \\"the philosophical study of education and its problems (...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy\\". \\"The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.\\" As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive, and/or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does not define philosophy education?","completion":"To approach this question, let's break down some aspects that are not central to defining philosophy of education: 1. Specific content or subject matter: Philosophy of education is not restricted to particular content or a specific subject matter. It tends to focus on the broader aims and methods of education, rather than prescribing a set curriculum. 2. Fixed methodology: While the study of philosophy of education does involve philosophical methods, it is not bound to a single methodology. It can draw from various areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology, as well as employing speculative, prescriptive, and/or analytic approaches. 3. Exclusive focus on outcomes: Philosophy of education is not defined solely by the results or outcomes of the educational process. Although outcomes can be a subject of study within the field, the philosophy of education also encompasses questions about the values, norms, and processes that drive education. 4. Being confined to a specific age group: The philosophy of education is not defined by a particular age group or demographic. It can involve the study of education for children, adolescents, and adults, as well as the different methods and techniques employed in teaching and learning at various stages of development. By examining these aspects, we can conclude that philosophy of education is not defined by specific content, fixed methodologies, a narrow focus on outcomes, nor catering to a particular age group. Instead, it is an interdisciplinary field that considers the broader questions and issues related to the nature and purpose of education, the values and norms underlying educational practices, and the interplay between theory and practice in shaping learning experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The boy was born in May in Calgary - several months after his parents and their two children fled Syria's war. They hail from the capital Damascus.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective? ? The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the...

What are the most important words in the following sentence: couple and light in the end of the tunnel","completion":"In the sentence \\"couple and light in the end of the tunnel,\\" the most important words that carry the maximum amount of information and meaning are 'couple,' 'light,' and 'end of the tunnel.' 1. 'Couple': This word is significant because it sets up the subject of the sentence. Without a clear understanding of who or what the 'couple' is, we lose context and the sentence does not make sense. The word 'couple' could refer to two individuals in a romantic relationship, two friends, or even two objects, depending on the context. It carries relational information and applies a societal, emotional, or relational perspective. 2. 'Light': This word is significant because it conveys a particular image or concept, depending on interpretation. 'Light' is often associated with hope, inspiration, guidance or direction, and discovery. It contributes significantly to the symbolic nature of the sentence. 3. 'End of the tunnel': This phrase is a conventional metaphor meaning the conclusion of a difficult or dark period, generally associated with seeing a positive outcome or solution after a tough time or struggle. No other words in this sentence carry as much contextual and symbolic meaning as 'end of the tunnel.' It sets the scene and harnesses a lot of the emotional content. Each of these words or phrases brings a significant amount of meaning to the sentence, making them the most important. The 'couple' gives us the characters involved, the 'light' gives us a sense of what these characters are moving toward or experiencing, and the 'end of the tunnel' sets up the metaphorical or literal journey and struggle they have been/are going through.

A researcher takes a photograph of the bird.. (IV). A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird..","completion":"Of the given options, the best evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still present would be (III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird. Here's a detailed analysis of each option: (I) A bird watcher makes a sketch of the bird: While a bird watcher's sketch may provide some evidence that the bird might still exist, this is not a particularly strong or reliable form of evidence. Sketches can be influenced by personal interpretations and may not accurately represent the bird in question. Moreover, sketches cannot be verified through additional sources or technological means as photographs or video recordings can. Consequently, while intriguing, a sketch would likely not hold up as strong evidence to disprove the bird's extinction. (II) A scientist discovers fossil remains of the bird: Fossils can provide valuable information about the history of a species, including its distribution, morphology, and environmental context. Fossils can also help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between different species. However, discovering fossil remains of the bird would not disprove its extinction claim, since fossils are remnants from the past rather than current evidence of a living population. Instead, finding fossil remains would serve to validate the existence of the species but would not confirm the presence of living individuals in modern times. (III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird: A photograph, taken by a researcher and supplemented by other supporting documents such as GPS coordinates and date-stamped metadata, would provide the most compelling evidence that the bird species still exists. A clear, unambiguous photograph, validated by experts in the field, could be considered definitive proof that the bird is not extinct. A photograph can capture specific morphological features that are critical for identification and can be more easily scrutinized and verified by specialists in ornithology to establish the presence of the bird. Moreover, photographs provide a relatively standardized and unambiguous form of visual documentation that can be shared and analyzed among different experts and institutions. (IV) A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird: The existence of suitable habitat for a particular bird species is an essential factor for its survival. While it is positive news that a park ranger finds such a habitat, this alone does not provide direct evidence that the bird still exists. In fact, the bird's extinction, while still having its ideal habitat, could be due to other factors such as disease, predation, or human-induced habitat destruction in other areas. The presence of a suitable habitat may suggest the potential for reintroducing a bird species through conservation and restoration efforts. However, without any direct sighting or recorded evidence of the bird, the claim of its extinction cannot be effectively disproven. In conclusion, the strongest evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still alive would be a clear, unequivocal photograph of the bird taken by a researcher, accompanied by additional documentation to support the sighting's credibility. This would provide a reliable, verifiable basis for asserting that the bird is still present in modern times and can refute the earlier claim of its extinction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy? is inside the article: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club., can you guess it ?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What great bog was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322? , can you please find it? Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base... A:","completion":"The great bog that was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322 is Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog situated in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, England. Covering approximately 10.6 square miles, it forms part of the larger Manchester Mosses that make up the western edge of the South Lancashire Plain. The name Chat Moss may have originated from St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia. However, considering that it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word 'ced', meaning 'wood'. Another possibility is that the name derives from 'Ceatta', an Old English personal name, and 'mos', a swamp. Alternatively, the first element could be the Old English 'ceat', meaning a piece of wet ground. The bog was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. In the local dialect, 'moss' refers to a peat bog. Noted British writer Daniel Defoe visited Chat Moss in 1724 while traveling from Warrington to Manchester. He described the bog as a \\"black and dirty\\" surface that could not bear the weight of either horse or man, except during exceedingly dry seasons. Despite its seemingly inhospitable nature, the peat within Chat Moss was used as fuel by the poor cottagers living nearby. In the 16th century, during the reign of King Henry VIII, another British writer, John Leland, documented a major event where Chat Moss burst its boundaries following heavy rainfall. This incident destroyed much of the surrounding ground, including freshwater fish populations, by polluting the nearby Glasebrook and Mersey rivers with its stinking water and rolling moss. The moss eventually reached the shores of Wales, the Isle of Man, and even Ireland. The construction of the famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 presented a significant challenge due to the difficult task of providing a solid base on Chat Moss. Renowned engineer George Stephenson managed to overcome this challenge by laying a unique foundation of heather and branches, followed by a bed of stones and crushed rock, which supported the railway track and distributed its weight over the unstable bog. In summary, Chat Moss is the great bog that was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322. Its name may have originated from several possible sources, and it has had a significant impact on the local environment throughout its history. The construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway across it was a remarkable engineering feat of the 19th century, highlighting the importance of this vast, challenging, and historically significant peat bog."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass Here is a hypothesis: All the trees and plants are coming out Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to better understand how they relate and why the conclusion can be drawn. Premise: \\"yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass\\" This statement presents an observation and refers to the fact that trees, plants, and grass are emerging or growing, possibly due to seasonal changes. The phrase \\"thank goodness\\" adds an element of relief, leading us to assume that this occurrence is welcome or anticipated. Hypothesis: \\"All the trees and plants are coming out\\" This hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, stating that the trees and plants are emerging or growing. Now, let's examine how these two statements relate and if it's possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. 1. Both the premise and hypothesis mention the same central idea - trees and plants are emerging or growing. The premise includes the additional element of grass, but this doesn't contradict the hypothesis as grass is just another type of plant. 2. The premise being true means that the person making the statement has observed the trees, plants and grass emerging or growing, and feels relieved about it. This observation directly supports the hypothesis, which simply states that trees and plants are coming out. Taking these aspects into account, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This conclusion arises from the fact that the central idea of both premise and hypothesis involves trees and plants coming out, and that the premise's truth reinforces the direct observation of the phenomena described in the hypothesis. Consequently, if the premise holds true, then it strongly suggests that the hypothesis is true as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments? Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

FINAL EXAM Question 1. Did Heath v. Alabama or Lawrence v. Texas take place first?","completion":"Heath v. Alabama took place first, before Lawrence v. Texas. Heath v. Alabama is a United States Supreme Court case that was decided on November 6, 1985. The case involved a criminal defendant named Larry Gene Heath, who had been charged with the murder of his wife and unborn child in both Alabama and Georgia. The primary question was whether the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibited the second trial in Alabama after Heath had already been convicted and sentenced in Georgia for the same crime. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply in this case, as the two states were separate sovereigns, and therefore, two separate trials could be held. Lawrence v. Texas is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that was decided on June 26, 2003. The case involved two men, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner, who were arrested and convicted under a Texas law that criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults. The defendants appealed their convictions, arguing that the Texas law violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects the right to liberty and privacy. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Texas law was unconstitutional, holding that the state had no legitimate interest in regulating private, consensual sexual conduct between adults. This landmark decision effectively invalidated all similar laws across the United States that criminalized consensual same-sex activity and significantly advanced LGBTQ+ rights in the country. In summary, Heath v. Alabama took place first, with the case being decided in 1985, while Lawrence v. Texas took place later, with the decision being handed down in 2003. Both cases addressed important legal issues, with Heath v. Alabama focusing on the limits of the Double Jeopardy Clause in the context of multiple prosecutions by different states, and Lawrence v. Texas addressing the constitutionality of laws that criminalized private, consensual sexual conduct between adults."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are possible answers to this question: - aquarium - creek - pet store - playground - pond I believe the correct choice is \\"aquarium\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Aquarium, and there are several reasons that support this conclusion. First, let's analyze each potential answer and consider the plausibility of the situation. 1. Aquarium: This is a highly likely scenario since goldfish are commonly kept as pets or display animals in aquariums. A colorful pebble may be used as a decoration in the tank along with other ornaments. 2. Creek: Although it is possible for goldfish to be found in a creek, it is less likely for a colorful pebble to specifically land on a goldfish in this setting. Creeks can be expansive, and the probability of the pebble and the goldfish's positions aligning in a way that allows the pebble to fall on the goldfish is much lower than in a confined space, such as an aquarium. 3. Pet store: While goldfish can indeed be found in pet stores, it becomes less likely for a colorful pebble to fall on the goldfish - the pet store would typically contain goldfish in a tank, much like an aquarium, but the pebble would have to either be dropped accidentally or deliberately placed on the goldfish. 4. Playground: This scenario is highly improbable as goldfish would not naturally be found in a playground, and it would be quite unusual for someone to bring a goldfish to a playground where it could potentially be exposed to a colorful pebble. 5. Pond: Similar to the creek scenario, it is possible for goldfish to be found in a pond, but the likelihood of a colorful pebble landing on a goldfish in a pond is low. Ponds are larger bodies of water, and the odds of the pebble falling directly on a goldfish become more diminished compared to an aquarium setting. With these considerations, it becomes evident that the most plausible answer to the question is \\"aquarium.\\" An aquarium is a closed environment in which goldfish are commonly found, and it is also an environment that is easily controlled and managed by humans. This gives the highest chance for a colorful pebble to fall on a goldfish, as both elements are purposefully placed in the space in close proximity to one another, oftentimes as decorations. Additionally, the other scenarios presented, although not impossible, are highly improbable and far less likely than the aquarium scenario. In most cases, the positions of the pebble and the goldfish are determined by natural occurrences, making it unlikely for a random colorful pebble to fall onto a goldfish in the wild or in other uncommon locations.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America.

The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call \\"Collie\\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. Common use of the name \\"collie\\" in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds such as to the Rough Collie in parts of the United States, or to the Border Collie in many rural parts of Great Britain. Many collie types do not actually include \\"collie\\" in their name. - Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (known professionally as Warner Bros.

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as \\"GSD\\" and was also formerly known as the Alsatian in Britain. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom. - Rin Tin Tin (often hyphenated as Rin-Tin-Tin, September 10, 1918 August 10, 1932) was a male German Shepherd that was an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a World War I battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him \\"Rinty\\". Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of Warner Bros. studios, and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck. - Etzel von Oeringen (October 1, 1917 June 24, 1929), better known as Strongheart, was a male German Shepherd who became one of the earliest canine film stars. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Eric Oswald Mowbray Knight (April 10, 1897 in Menston in West Yorkshire, England January 15, 1943 in Suriname) was an English novelist and screenwriter, who is mainly notable for creating the fictional collie Lassie. He took American citizenship in 1942 shortly before his death. - Nunavut (from Inuktitut: ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993.

Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Lassie is a fictional character created by Eric Knight, she is a female Rough Collie dog, and is featured in a short story that was later expanded to a full-length novel called \\"Lassie Come-Home\\". Knight's portrayal of Lassie bears some features in common with another fictional female collie of the same name, and is featured in the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell's 1859 short story called \\"The Half Brothers.\\" In \\"The Half Brothers\\", Lassie is loved only by her young master and guides the adults back to where two boys are lost in a snowstorm. - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area.

It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated breed of medium to large size dog that in its original form was a type of collie used and bred for herding in Scotland. Originating in the 1800s, it is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and through the \\"Lassie\\" novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable, merles, and tri-coloured. This breed looks like a bigger version of the Shetland Sheepdog, but they are not related.

Place the end of the bandage against the skin and then wrap the bandage around it several times to keep it in place. You want the bandage to be medium tight. This means that it is tight enough to stay in place while not cutting off the circulation. Work your way down from the ankle. When you get to the heel start wrapping around the arch of the foot and down to the toes. It may be that that very corner of your heel is still exposed after your first pass. Then wrap back up the foot and the ankle, making sure to cover areas that have not yet been covered. Keep a small amount of tension on the bandage as you go. This will keep your wraps neat but will not put too much restriction on your circulation. Once you have used up all of your bandage, it needs to be physically attached to itself. Many modern compression bandages come with Velcro on their ends, which will attach to the bandage when it is pressed on the surface. However, if yours doesn't have Velcro, you will need to use a safety pin to secure the end. Summary:","completion":"When you need to wrap a hurt leg, start above the ouchy spot.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

Attempts by the gallery's board of directors to fire Bean are thwarted by the chairman who, for unspecified reasons, is very fond of him. Desperate to rid themselves of the turmoil Bean unintentionally causes, the board members send him to the United States to represent them at the unveiling of the portrait Whistler's Mother, which has been purchased for 50 million by the Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Bean's visit has been arranged by the gallery's curator, David Langley (Peter MacNicol) who is being very impressed by the National Gallery's fabricated praise of \\"Dr. Bean\\", decides to board him in his house. On his flight to Los Angeles, Bean attempts to amuse a child with air sickness by blowing up his M&Ms; bag and popping it to wake up the man in front of him, but without success. After the child throws up into an air sickness bag, Bean takes the bag from him and repeats the bag popping over the man's face, only to splatter him with vomit. He hides from the man upon his arrival to Los Angeles, where he is detained at the airport due to pretending to have a gun. His arrival at David's house is initially met with subtle hostility from David's wife Alison (Pamela Reed), son Kevin (Andrew Lawrence), and daughter Jennifer (Tricia Vessey). Alison refuses David's request to allow Bean to live with them for two months, and David promises Alison that he will talk to Bean and take him to a hotel after their meeting at the gallery. Bean's unorthodox arrival at the gallery worries many of David's colleagues, particularly his boss, George Grierson (Harris Yulin), who subtly warns David that he will be responsible for Bean's actions at the unveiling of the painting, but David promises that he can handle Bean, convinced that he is merely a little eccentric. When David takes Bean back to his house, Alison departs for her mother's home, unwilling to live with Bean. With his family gone,...

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep. Go to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. X then signed to Elektra in 1982 to release Under the Big Black Sun, which marked a slight departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The album was heavily influenced by the death of Cervenka's elder sister Mirielle (Mary) in a 1980 automobile accident. Three songs on the album (\\"Riding with Mary\\", \\"Come Back to Me\\" and the title track) all directly related to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of Al Dubin and Joe Burke's \\"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\\", was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka's mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album \\"You know, my favorite record is Under the Big Black Sun, so everything else is kind of . . . I'm saying if I had to sit down in a room and put on an X record--which I don't generally do--I have recently listened to some X records but I generally don't listen to myself--the record I would pick to listen to would be Under the Big Black Sun. In 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the More Fun in the New World album, making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band's rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\", and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The record received critical praise from Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound. The Knitters, a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of the Red Devils) on double bass, and released the Poor Little Critter on the Road album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; their take on Merle Haggard's \\"Silver Wings\\" \\"may be the definitive version\\". Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was \\"Under the Big Black Sun\\" a successful album?","completion":"Yes, \\"Under the Big Black Sun\\" was a successful album.

The shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at. This film actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent Michigan releases like \\"Dark Tomorrow\\" and \\"Biker Zombies.\\" Subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's 350,000 budget.

Eric Seaver doesn't evolve at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Comedy of intrigue is a genre that includes what comedy by William Shakespeare that is thought to have been written in 1598?","completion":"Comedy of intrigue is a theatrical genre which emphasizes elaborate and intricate plotlines, witty dialogue, and convoluted schemes usually intended to deceive or manipulate other characters, often resulting in comical misunderstandings and humorous situations. Within this genre, there is a well-renowned comedy by the universally acclaimed playwright, William Shakespeare, that is believed to have been penned around 1598. This comedic play is titled \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is one of Shakespeare's most popular and enduring plays, employing themes of love, mistaken identities, deception, and manipulation, all of which are hallmarks of the comedy of intrigue. The play is set in Messina, a port city on the island of Sicily, Italy, and primarily focuses on two romantic relationships between the main characters: Beatrice and Benedick, as well as Hero and Claudio. The story begins with the arrival of Don Pedro, the Prince of Aragon, and his entourage, which includes two young soldiers, Claudio and Benedick, who have just returned from a successful military campaign. Upon their arrival, Claudio falls in love with the governor's daughter, Hero, and plans to marry her. However, various complications arise in the form of deliberate deceit and mischief orchestrated by Don John, Don Pedro's disgruntled and antagonistic illegitimate brother. Don John makes it his mission to disrupt the romantic relationships and the lives of other characters, leading to mistaken identities and multiple humorous misunderstandings. Meanwhile, Beatrice and Benedick, who are both known for their sharp wit and strong opinions on love and marriage, are constantly engaged in a verbal battle of wits. The two engage in a \\"merry war\\" of verbal sparring and refuse to acknowledge any potential romantic feelings for each other. However, their friends are determined to bring them together, so a group of comical conspirators initiates an elaborate plan to deceive both Benedick and Beatrice into believing that each is secretly in love with the other. This subplot adds an additional layer of intrigue to the play's central story, creating an even more complex and humorous narrative. As the play unfolds, more comical misunderstandings take place, misunderstandings are eventually resolved, false rumors are dispelled, and love triumphs over deceit, ultimately ending in the joining of both couples in marriage. \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" remains an excellent example of a comedy of intrigue, with its skillful blending of complex storylines, engaging characters, and witty dialogue, which come together to present a compelling and timeless narrative that continues to entertain audiences more than four centuries after it was first written."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These categories are aspects of the more nuanced nature of sexual identity and terminology. For example, people may use other labels, such as pansexual or polysexual, or none at all. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation \\"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions\\". Androphilia and gynephilia are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual orientation as an alternative to a gender binary conceptualization. Androphilia describes sexual attraction to masculinity; gynephilia describes the sexual attraction to femininity. The term sexual preference largely overlaps with sexual orientation, but is generally distinguished in psychological research.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. ‘Mom Always Liked You Best’ The notion that parents cherish all their children equally — or at least say they do — is so entrenched in our culture that colleagues warned Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist at Cornell University embarking on the first of many studies of family favoritism, that his research would prove futile. No mother, they insisted, would admit to caring more for one son or daughter than another. So much for that. His team’s interviewers, talking to mothers ages 65 to 75 in the Boston area about their adult offspring, found that most were perfectly willing to name favorites. “Most mothers have very distinct preferences,” Dr. Pillemer said. “There’s one to whom they feel most emotionally close, one with whom they have the most conflict. Parental favoritism is a fundamental part of the family landscape throughout life.” In other words, he added, “the Smothers Brothers were right.” (Note to younger readers: On their hit comedy show in the 1960s, Tom Smothers used to complain to brother Dick that … well, read the headline above.) Further studies revealed that middle-aged children often recognized that their parents felt closer to one child than another — but were off-base about who ranked highest. “They typically choose themselves,” Dr. Pillemer said, “and they’re typically wrong.” One might file this under “Stuff I’d Just as Soon Not Know,” except that the care of the elderly falls mostly to their children and that one child usually shoulders the bulk of the responsibility. Mothers also express clear ideas about whom they want and expect to take on that role, it turns out, so their partiality has consequences. Who’s the lucky child? She is the one the mother feels emotionally closest to and thinks is most similar, who shares her attitudes and values. And she is the one who has provided support and help for her mother in the past. The choice of pronoun is deliberate: research has long confirmed that this job falls overwhelmingly to daughters. That reflects women’s traditional roles, but Dr. Pillemer pointed out that it also reflected similarity — a higher degree of closeness between mothers and daughters than between mothers and sons. “If you expect you may be losing your autonomy, you want a child who shares your values,” he said. “If someone’s going to be making decisions for you and you know you’re going to be dependent on her, you want someone you feel close to.” What does not seem to make much difference is whether a child has competing demands on her time — whether she can actually take on these tasks. “Mom’s not thinking of things like: ‘Is my daughter married? Does she have children? Does she have problems that might prevent her being a good caregiver? Does she have the resources to be a good caregiver?’” Dr. Pillemer said. “Being married or being a parent didn’t matter at all. Being employed only mattered a little.” (Children did get a pass if they were geographically distant.) Nor do mothers put much weight on reciprocity — whether they had provided help to particular children in the past. Expectations about caregiving clearly represent an emotional decision, not a pragmatic one. In fact, even a child who would appear patently unsuitable gets the nod if the mother always liked her best. To the investigators’ surprise, mothers were not dissuaded by a history of substance abuse or other mental health problems, or even by past trouble with the law. Susie, who did drugs and ended up in rehab for months, is picked if she and her mother are close; Billy, who has been Mr. Straightarrow but feels more distant with Mom, isn’t really in the running. I confess that I had trouble envisioning a family conversation on this subject. In a society where most older people cannot even bear to sign an advance directive, are they really going to talk about which children they have quietly chosen as their future caregivers? Acknowledging preferences to a researcher who guarantees your anonymity might prove a lot easier than acknowledging them to your children. Dr. Pillemer wasn’t so sure. He said families eventually talked about who was going to do what to take care of their parents. If Susie is planning to light out for the other coast to start a new life as a ceramicist and won’t be on call, it is better to know that sooner rather than later.

What type of animal is the Alaskan husky and Small Münsterländer? The answer is:","completion":"The Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are two distinct types of dog breeds, each with their own unique characteristics, backgrounds, and uses. By examining these breeds individually, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of what type of animals they are. First, let's discuss the Alaskan Husky. The Alaskan Husky is a breed of working dog that is primarily used for sled racing and transportation in Arctic regions. Although they are genetically diverse and not officially recognized as a standardized breed by major kennel clubs, Alaskan Huskies typically possess certain traits that make them ideally suited for their intended tasks. These dogs have a lean, muscular build, which enables them to maintain high levels of endurance and strength. Their thick double coats provide insulation against harsh winter weather, and their large paws help them to traverse snowy terrain with ease. Alaskan Huskies are known for their speed, stamina, and strong work ethic. They are also an intelligent and friendly breed, forming close bonds with their human handlers. In contrast, the Small Münsterländer, also known as the Kleine Münsterländer, is a versatile hunting dog breed that originated in the Münster region of Germany. This breed is part of the gun dog family and is known for its exceptional skills in tracking, pointing, and retrieving game, both on land and in water. The Small Münsterländer is recognized as a standardized breed by many kennel clubs, including the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and the American Kennel Club. Small Münsterländers have a medium-sized, well-proportioned build, with strong muscles, a dense, wavy coat, and feathering on their legs, ears, and tail. They are characterized by their keen sense of smell and high level of intelligence, as well as their adaptability and enthusiasm for work. These dogs are adept at hunting all types of game, from birds to rabbits and even deer. They are also known for their friendly and affectionate nature, making them excellent companions and family pets in addition to being skilled hunting partners. In conclusion, although the Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are both types of dogs, they serve different purposes and possess unique characteristics that set them apart from one another. The Alaskan Husky is a strong, resilient sled dog with origins in Arctic regions, while the Small Münsterländer is a versatile hunting dog from Germany. Both breeds are intelligent, adaptable, and friendly, making them highly valued as working dogs and beloved companions."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

And as far back as October, the actor also pulled a \\"hidden handgun\\" in a separate incident with a neighbor at his North Hills home, the DA said. It's unclear if it was the same neighbor involved in both disputes, or what sparked the arguments. The 27-year-old star never fired the gun or struck his neighbor with it during the most recent confrontation, according to TMZ. But the act of pointing the gun is enough to constitute assault alone. A rep for Jones told the celebrity gossip site that they believe the TV actor will be acquitted. \\"It is our understanding that the gun in Mr. Jones' possession was fully legal and registered, that he was on his girlfriend's private property, and that he and his girlfriend felt that they were under threat in a dispute with neighbors,\\" the rep said. The actor is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday. He could receive more than five years in prison if he is convicted.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the exact title of the diploma piece without which Etty could not become a Royal Academician? In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The use of Java: Java is a widely-used programming language because of several reasons that make it an attractive choice for developers and businesses alike. Here are some of the key reasons why organizations and individuals prefer using Java: 1. Platform Independence: Java's \\"Write Once, Run Anywhere\\" approach allows Java applications to run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it easier for developers to create applications that work consistently across multiple platforms. 2. Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) which enables developers to build modular, reusable and easily maintainable code. OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction allow for increased flexibility and improved overall code quality. 3. Strong Community Support: Java has a large, active, and well-established community of developers, which means that developers have access to a wealth of resources, including libraries, frameworks, tutorials, and support forums. This strong community makes it easier for developers to find solutions to common challenges and continuously improve their skillset. 4. Robustness and Security: Java offers built-in security features such as runtime exception handling and type checking that help prevent errors and protect applications from vulnerabilities. The Java security model restricts access to critical system resources, ensuring that applications are less prone to system crashes, data corruption, and security breaches. 5. Scalability and Performance: Java is designed to support the development of high-performance and highly scalable applications. Features such as multithreading, automatic memory management, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation help to enhance application performance, ensuring that Java applications can effectively handle varying workloads and maintain responsiveness in an efficient manner. 6. Rich Ecosystem: Java’s ecosystem includes numerous open-source libraries and frameworks, which help speed up the development process and allow developers to focus on business logic rather than developing every component from scratch. Some popular Java frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, among others. In The Revenant, why did the tribes attack Glass and his company when they didn't kidnap the chief’s daughter? In the movie \\"The Revenant,\\" the Arikara tribe attacks Glass and his company after mistakenly believing that the fur trappers had kidnapped the daughter of their chief, Elk Dog. This attack is the result of a misunderstanding and a series of unfortunate events that led the tribe to believe that their chief's daughter, Powaqa, had been abducted by the trappers. The tribespeople's primary goal throughout the movie is to recover Powaqa and protect their community, leading to several conflicts and aggressive encounters with Glass and his companions. It is important to note that these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question focuses on the use of Java as a programming language and the benefits it provides, while the second question is about a specific plot point in the movie \\"The Revenant.\\" The two questions address completely unrelated topics, and as such, they cannot be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trebuie să ne dăm seama că independenţa băncilor centrale nu a fost opţiunea potrivită, atât din punctul de vedere al controlului democratic şi politic, cât şi din cel al eficacităţii economice. Translate this to English?","completion":"We must realize that the independence of central banks has not been the appropriate choice, considering it both from the perspective of democratic and political control, as well as from the one of economic effectiveness. We must acknowledge that numerous factors indicate the fact that the independence of central banks may not have been the best choice when we evaluate this policy decision in the context of democratic and political control, along with its consequences on the economic effectiveness of our societies. In the following detailed analysis, we will examine the limitations and challenges posed by this approach, focusing on its implications for democratic accountability and economic productivity. Firstly, from the standpoint of political control and democracy, the independence of central banks can be viewed as a challenge to the core principles of a democratic system. It is widely understood that in democratic societies, policy decisions and the exercise of power are supposed to be vested in the hands of elected representatives, who are held accountable by the citizens. This way, the general public can influence decisions that impact their lives and shape the direction of their communities. However, when central banks operate independently, this means that monetary policy decisions are made by unelected officials, shielded from any direct influence by the public or their elected representatives. Such decisions can have significant consequences on inflation, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables that directly impact the livelihoods of citizens. By giving central banks the autonomy to take these decisions in isolation, we effectively remove a layer of democratic accountability and public influence. This can lead to situations where the policies enacted may not necessarily align with the larger public interest or the preferences of the majority. Secondly, the economic effectiveness of central banks is a crucial aspect that needs to be assessed in evaluating the appropriateness of their independence. Autonomous central banks generally adhere to a mandate of maintaining price stability, which implies controlling inflation within a predetermined range. Although price stability is an essential precondition for long-term economic growth, focus on this singular goal may sometimes translate to a disregard for other important macroeconomic objectives, such as job creation or income distribution. A less independent central bank, on the other hand, may have a broader mandate, incorporating multiple objectives within its policy framework and facilitating a more comprehensive approach to macroeconomic management. This might lead to a more balanced policy mix that addresses various dimensions of economic well-being. Additionally, the potential for enhanced coordination with fiscal authorities can contribute towards mitigating economic crises through more effective countercyclical measures, including targeted stimulus and policy adjustments. In conclusion, considering the independence of central banks from the lens of democratic and political control, as well as economic effectiveness, it is evident that there are valid concerns associated with this policy choice. The detachment of central banks from direct public accountability and influence might undermine the core tenets of democratic governance, while their narrow policy focus can sometimes prioritize price stability at the expense of other crucial macroeconomic objectives. Thus, it is essential to continue assessing and evolving our understanding of such institutional arrangements, weighing their benefits against potential drawbacks to ensure a sound decision-making process and the overall prosperity of our societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His parents were Hadji Kalla, a local businessman and Athirah, a woman who sold Buginese silk for a living. He was the second of 10 children. After completing school, Kalla attended Hasanuddin University in Makassar. Context: Kalla has been often mentioned as a possible nominee of the Golkar Party in the 2014 presidential race. In 2009 Kalla ran in the Indonesian presidential election with former Armed Forces Chief of Staff Wiranto as his running mate, finishing third with 12.4% of the vote. During a dedication ceremony of the Indonesian Red Cross headquarters in the Riau province on 3 February 2012 Kalla stated his willingness to run in the presidential election in 2014 should he receive sufficient public support. By May 2012 however, Kalla stated that he had no intention of running in the 2014 Presidential election. Kalla said he had no hard feelings about party chairman Aburizal Bakrie's upcoming inauguration as presidential candidate for the Golkar Party and that he had no intention of competing with him despite surveys that showed that Kalla was likely to be more electable than Bakrie. During Golkar's National Leadership meeting in Bogor on 29 June 2012, Bakrie was officially declared the Golkar Party's 2014 Presidential candidate. Nevertheless, in the changeable political scene in Indonesia the situation can be expected to evolve in the preparations for the 2014 presidential election. In late 2012 Jusuf Kalla indicated that he would be prepared to move away from Golkar and join a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) with former president Megawati as candidate for president and him as the vice-presidential candidate. \\"If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics,\\" Kalla said. Question: Was he asked to run or did he decide on his own?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Jusuf Kalla's decision to express his willingness to run in the 2014 presidential election, as mentioned during the dedication ceremony of the Indonesian Red Cross headquarters on 3 February 2012, seemed to be a personal decision that he made based on public support. However, as the political scene evolved, it is clear that Kalla's final decision to potentially run on a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) alongside Megawati, was likely influenced by a combination of personal aspirations, political party dynamics, and public opinion. In May 2012, Kalla stated that he had no intention to run in the 2014 presidential race and expressed no desire to compete against Aburizal Bakrie, who was later declared Golkar Party's presidential candidate in June 2012. It can be inferred that Kalla may not have received explicit support from his own party (Golkar) to pursue the presidency, which could have been a factor in his initial decision not to run. However, by late 2012, Kalla showed a change of heart and openness to enter the presidential race, not as a representative of the Golkar Party, but rather through a partnership with the PDI-P. This shift suggests that Kalla's decision may have been influenced by the evolving political landscape and potential opportunities presented by aligning with another party, such as the PDI-P. Kalla's statement, \\"If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics,\\" further indicates the role of political maneuvering in determining his decisions. In conclusion, Jusuf Kalla's decision to express interest in running for the 2014 presidential election appears to be a combination of personal motivation and political influences. The initial decision was likely made on his own, based on public support and aspirations, but his eventual openness to run under a different ticket was undeniably influenced by evolving political circumstances and opportunities."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","completion":"The cherry pit heated up less when rolling over the lunchroom floor. To understand this scenario, we must explore the factors that impact the rolling motion of the cherry pit and its heating. Two primary forces are at play here: friction and rolling resistance. Friction refers to the resistance that occurs when one object moves against another. Rolling resistance, on the other hand, is the force that opposes the rolling motion of an object due to deformation, or the changes in the shape and structure of the object and surface in contact. When Tim rolled the cherry pit on his lunch tray, the pit likely experienced lower rolling resistance due to the smooth and relatively uniform surface of the tray. In contrast, the lunchroom floor may be rougher and have more uneven features, increasing rolling resistance. To overcome this resistance, more energy is required for the cherry pit to maintain its rolling motion. Heat is generated as a result of this additional energy input and the mechanical work done to overcome the rolling resistance. When the cherry pit rolls on the lunchroom floor, the increased resistance results in more work being done and more energy being converted into heat. This leads to a higher temperature for the cherry pit when it rolls on the floor compared to the lunch tray. Therefore, when rolling on the lunchroom floor, the cherry pit experiences slower motion and higher rolling resistance, leading to more energy being converted into heat. This means that the cherry pit heated up less when rolling over the lunch tray as compared to the lunchroom floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The next Monday, after dropping her daughter at school, she was overwhelmed by a desire to make art. Almost instinctively, she said, she began to paint on a wall along rue Alibert that is often used as a canvas for local street artists – and is just steps from Le Petit Cambodge and Le Carillon, two cafes targeted in the attacks. Several mothers from her daughter’s school, just on the other side of the wall, took notice of Ms. Kami’s work and requested permission from the local government to paint the entire wall. “We wanted to do something,” said one of them, Gaelle Giffard, who crowdfunded 500 euros from the neighborhood to cover the cost of paint. The result is “Dessine-Moi un Bouquet,” a communitywide initiative that invited street and graffiti artists, as well as local residents and children, to cover the wall with images in response to the attacks. One mother told Ms. Kami that the wall, nicknamed Le Mur de l’Amour, or wall of love, has had a calming effect so that she is no longer afraid to walk in the street. An elderly man told Ms. Kami that simply watching her paint helped him find peace.

Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\".

OPTIONS: - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What is there in the Bermuda triangle? The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean that is roughly triangular in shape, with vertices at Miami, Florida; Bermuda; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It covers an area of approximately 500,000 square miles. Due to its geographical location, the area experiences unique weather patterns and oceanographic features that may provide clues for answering this question. Various natural phenomena exist within the Bermuda Triangle that can potentially explain some of the events and disappearances linked to this region: 1. Compass variation: In the Bermuda Triangle, compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, resulting in navigation issues. This is because the earth's magnetic fields change, and the region has one of the few places where true north and magnetic north align. 2. Gulf Stream: The Gulf Stream is a powerful, fast-moving ocean current that runs through the area and can quickly change weather conditions and move ships off course. 3. Methane hydrates: Methane hydrates deposits on the ocean floor can release gas, causing the water to become less dense and potentially cause ships to sink. 4. Rogue waves: These are unusually large waves that can form suddenly and without warning, posing a significant threat to ships and aircraft. 5. Hexagonal clouds: Meteorologists have discovered hexagonal cloud formations in the Bermuda Triangle that can cause intense downbursts of wind, known as \\"air bombs,\\" and may be responsible for some incidents. Question 2: What is the truth behind the Bermuda Triangle? As for the truth behind the Bermuda Triangle, while some blame mysterious forces or extraterrestrial activity for the various disappearances that have occurred in the region, there is no single, definitive explanation for the alleged events. Numerous scientific theories have been proposed, revolving around the natural phenomena mentioned above, that could potentially account for a significant number of the incidents. In addition to these explanations, it is essential to consider human error, equipment failure, and other causes that are commonly associated with accidents in the open sea. Furthermore, the higher number of reported incidents in the region may be attributed to increased traffic due to the area's location along major shipping and air travel routes. Comparing the two questions, it can be inferred that both questions are related but not identical. Question 1 asks about the specific elements found within the Bermuda Triangle, whereas Question 2 aims to address the underlying truth behind the phenomena and occurrences associated with the region. Therefore, while the two questions address the general topic of the Bermuda Triangle, they are not asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

(B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","completion":"(A). Yes, \\"One guy playing his instrument\\" and \\"One man is playing his instrument\\" essentially convey the same meaning. However, there are some minor differences in the choice of words and the grammatical structure of these phrases. In both phrases, we are describing a situation in which an individual, referred to as \\"guy\\" or \\"man,\\" is in the act of playing a musical instrument. Both terms, \\"guy\\" and \\"man,\\" are commonly used to refer to an adult male individual. The choice between \\"guy\\" and \\"man\\" here is mainly a matter of style or preference, with 'guy' being more informal, and 'man' being a more neutral term. The first phrase, \\"One guy playing his instrument,\\" is a noun phrase that lacks a verb which would indicate the action of playing. It still presents a clear mental image of the situation and is often utilized in informal contexts or as a concise description. The second phrase, \\"One man is playing his instrument,\\" is a complete sentence comprising a subject, verb, and object. The verb \\"is playing\\" denotes the ongoing action of playing the musical instrument and the sentence, as a whole, is more grammatically formal. In summary, while both phrases have the same meaning, there are slight differences in the choice of words (i.e., \\"guy\\" vs. \\"man\\") and the grammatical structure. However, these distinctions do not alter the core meaning of the phrases, which is to describe a single adult male person playing his musical instrument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?

Disfellowshipping is the strongest form of discipline, involving shunning unrepentant offenders to keep the congregation free from immoral influence and encourage the individual to realize the seriousness of their actions.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature. You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. Make sure that your story does not repeat the relation in the given paragraph (e.g., by avoiding verbatim copies of the given paragraph). Start by reading the background paragraph, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. Write a story that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to use your own words as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph. Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Problem:Background Paragraph: Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years or so. However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains approximately 300 sextillion (3×1023) stars and more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies. Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million (107) stars up to giants with one trillion (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The Universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the concepts in the background paragraph. Usage: Matter, dark matter, dark energy, galaxies, clusters, superclusters, galactic filaments, voids, and large regions of relative emptiness. Explanation: These concepts are mentioned in the background paragraph, detailing different celestial structures, distributions in, and the scale of the universe. Part #2: Determine relationships in the background paragraph. Usage: The hierarchical distribution of matter and the range of structure sizes in the universe. Explanation: The given paragraph demonstrates a hierarchical relationship between various celestial structures, as well as the size range of these structures (from dwarf galaxies to giant galaxies). Part #3: Write a fictional story making use of the concepts and relationships. Usage: Maria, an astronaut, embarks on a journey to explore one of the galaxy clusters present within the Laniakea Supercluster. Explanation: Maria's journey involves the relationship between celestial structures as she explores a part of the vast Laniakea Supercluster, which the Local Group of galaxies containing Milky Way is a part of. Part #4: Avoid repeating the relationship in the given paragraph verbatim. Usage: Maria's mission is to study and map the distribution of dwarf and giant galaxies in an unknown galaxy cluster, rather than directly addressing the hierarchical distribution of matter. Explanation: The story does not directly repeat the hierarchical distribution of matter but incorporates the concepts of different sizes of galaxies and their distribution within a larger celestial structure. Part #5: Provide a connection back to the background paragraph. Usage: At one point, Maria encounters a vast void measuring hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter, reminding her that the Universe is filled with such empty regions. Explanation: The vast void Maria encounters ties back to the background paragraph, which details that voids exist between larger structures in the Universe."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The only president to remain a bachelor, Buchanan's personal life has attracted great historical interest. His biographer Jean Baker argues that Buchanan was asexual or celibate. Several writers have put forth arguments that he was homosexual, including sociologist James W. Loewen, and authors Robert P. Watson and Shelley Ross. In 1818, Buchanan met Anne Caroline Coleman at a grand ball at Lancaster's White Swan Inn, and the two began courting. Anne was the daughter of the wealthy iron manufacturer (and protective father) Robert Coleman and sister-in-law of Philadelphia judge Joseph Hemphill, one of Buchanan's colleagues from the House of Representatives. By 1819, the two were engaged, but could spend little time together; Buchanan was extremely busy with his law firm and political projects during the Panic of 1819, which took him away from Coleman for weeks at a time. Conflicting rumors abounded. Some suggested that he was marrying for her money, because his own family was less affluent, or that he was involved with other women. Buchanan never publicly spoke of his motives or feelings, but letters from Anne revealed she knew of several rumors. Coleman broke off the engagement, and soon afterward, on December 9, 1819, died suddenly. Buchanan wrote her father for permission to attend the funeral, claiming \\"I feel happiness has fled from me forever\\"; However, Robert Coleman refused permission. After Coleman's death, Buchanan never courted another woman, nor seemed to show any emotional or physical interest. An unfounded rumor circulated of an affair with President Polk's widow, Sarah Childress Polk. Some believe that Anne's death served to deflect awkward questions about Buchanan's sexuality and bachelorhood. During Buchanan's presidency, his orphaned niece, Harriet Lane, whom he had adopted, served as official White House hostess. Buchanan had a close and intimate relationship with William Rufus King, an Alabamian politician who briefly served as vice president under Franklin Pierce. Buchanan and King lived together in a Washington boardinghouse for many years, from 1834 until King's departure for France in 1844. King referred to the relationship as a \\"communion\\", and the two attended social functions together. Contemporaries also noted the closeness. Andrew Jackson called King \\"Miss Nancy\\" and prominent Democrat Aaron V. Brown referred to King as Buchanan's \\"better half\\", \\"wife\\" and \\"Aunt Fancy\\" (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man), Sociologist Loewen noted that \\"wags\\" described Buchanan and King as \\"Siamese twins\\", that Buchanan late in life wrote a letter acknowledging that he might marry a woman who could accept his \\"lack of ardent or romantic affection\\", and also that Buchanan was expelled from his Lancaster church, reportedly for pro-slavery views acquired during the King relationship. Catherine Thompson, the wife of cabinet member Jacob Thompson, later noted that \\"there was something unhealthy in the president's attitude\\". King became ill in 1853 and died of tuberculosis shortly after Pierce's inauguration, four years before Buchanan became president. Buchanan described him as \\"among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known.\\" Jean Baker's biography of Buchanan notes that his and King's nieces may have destroyed some correspondence between Buchanan and King. She opines that the length and intimacy of their surviving letters (one written by King upon his ambassadorial departure being specifically cited by Loewen) illustrate only \\"the affection of a special friendship.\\" Answer this question \\"Is there anything interesting about James Buchanan's personal life?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about James Buchanan's personal life.

Let's examine each sentence in detail and compare their meanings. 1. His mother, born in Devonshire, was the tenth child of parents who emigrated to Canada from Kingston. 2. His mother, born in Kingston, was the tenth child of parents who had migrated from Devonshire to Canada. In both sentences, the key information provided is that the mother is the tenth child of parents who migrated from Devonshire to Canada. The main difference between the two sentences pertains to the birthplace of the mother and the order of events, as detailed below: 1. In the first sentence, the mother is born in Devonshire. It specifies that the parents emigrated to Canada from Kingston, but the sentence doesn't provide a clear timeline of when the parents moved to Kingston. It's possible they moved to Kingston from Devonshire at some point before emigrating to Canada, but the exact sequence of events is not clear. 2. In the second sentence, the mother is born in Kingston. This sentence clarifies that the parents had already migrated from Devonshire to Canada (presumably settling in Kingston) before the mother was born. The use of the past perfect tense \\"had migrated\\" implies that the action was completed before the mother's birth. To sum it up, both sentences convey a general sense of the family's migration from Devonshire to Canada, but the primary difference lies in the mother's birthplace and the implied timeline of events. The first sentence implies the mother was born in Devonshire, with an unclear sequence of events surrounding the parents' move to Kingston and their subsequent emigration to Canada.

Usually a party leader retains the leadership until a successor is formally chosen however, in some situations this is not possible, and an interim leader is thus appointed by the party's caucus or the party executive. An interim leader may also be appointed while a leader is on a leave of absence due to poor health or some other reason, and then relinquish the position upon the leader's return. - Jean Pelletier, (February 21, 1935 January 10, 2009) was a Canadian politician, who served as the 37th mayor of Quebec City, Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office, and chairman of Via Rail.

Zhang Heng (Chinese: Zhang Heng ; AD 78-139), formerly romanized as Chang Heng, was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer, an achievement also attributed to Archimedes (c. 287-212 BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl. AD 10-70). Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had termed the device the ji li gu che, or \\"li-recording drum carriage\\" (the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640 ft). Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the \\"huang men\\"--court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal \\"drum-chariot\\". There is speculation that at some time during the 1st century BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb. The south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. Differential gears driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The Song Shu (c. AD 500 ) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, Ma Jun (200-265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is the south-point chariot?","completion":"The south-pointing chariot is \\"a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot.

After the payroll fuel is the biggest expense . There are very few ways for them to reduce their these overheads . Small companies will even find this harder than the bigger companies . Answer the following question: What action is the company likely to take with this advice ?","completion":"Based on the given advice, the company is likely to take a multi-faceted approach in an attempt to reduce overhead costs associated with payroll and fuel expenses. Although the advice indicates there are limited ways for businesses, especially smaller ones, to reduce these overheads, the company can still explore a range of strategies to optimize its operations and maximize cost efficiency. Some potential actions the company may consider include: 1. Implementing fuel-efficient practices: One solution to reducing fuel expenses would be to incorporate fuel-efficient technologies into their fleet of vehicles, such as utilizing electric or hybrid vehicles. The company can also invest in telematics and GPS tracking technology to monitor driver behavior, optimize routes, and minimize idling time, leading to efficient fuel consumption and reducing costs. 2. Workforce optimization: To address payroll expenses, the company could explore options like reevaluating their employee roster, ensuring that roles and responsibilities are precise, and that employees possess the necessary skills to perform their duties effectively. They may also consider investing in employee training and development to increase overall efficiency and workplace productivity. 3. Outsourcing and automation: Depending on the nature of the business, the company may explore outsourcing certain non-core tasks to external service providers or integrating automation and artificial intelligence (AI) systems into their operations. This could potentially help manage labor costs while still maintaining the quality of goods and services being provided. 4. Streamline processes: The company can examine its current business processes and determine if any unnecessary steps can be removed, combined, or redesigned, thereby reducing overhead, maximizing efficiency, and potentially lowering payroll costs. 5. Invest in renewable energy resources: For an eco-friendly solution and potential long-term savings, the company can explore renewable energy options such as solar power, which could help them reduce energy costs over time. 6. Cost-efficient partnerships: The company can establish relationships with vendors and suppliers who offer competitive pricing, good value, and a commitment to cost-saving practices, further assisting in reducing overall expenditures. 7. Employee retention: Focusing on employee retention is crucial for a company's overall cost reduction strategy. High employee turnover rates cost significantly more than adequately compensating and maintaining a stable workforce. By keeping employees satisfied and engaged in their work, the company can greatly reduce payroll costs connected with recruitment, hiring, and training new employees. 8. Periodic cost evaluations: The company should schedule regular assessments of their overhead costs. This can provide valuable insights into areas where they might be able to cut more expenses or identify inefficiencies in their current operations that could be improved. In conclusion, although the advice initially suggests that reducing overheads related to payroll and fuel expenses is difficult, especially for smaller companies, there are a number of strategies and actions the company can consider to effectively lower overhead costs and maximize operational efficiency. By taking a comprehensive approach to cost reduction, the company can develop solutions that not only address their immediate concerns but also promote long-term financial stability and growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package info.guardianproject.pixelknot. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: PixelKnot - Imperfect but Functional Image Steganography App Review: As a technology enthusiast who frequently dabbles in the world of secure and discreet communication, I have been using the PixelKnot app by Guardian Project for a while now. The app, which goes by the package name info.guardianproject.pixelknot, serves as an image steganography tool designed to enable users to encode messages within images. After using it for some time, I believe this app warrants a 3-star rating. Here's why: Step 1: Analyzing the App's Interface The user interface is a crucial aspect of any app; based on my experience, PixelKnot's interface is fairly clean and simple, allowing users to access its primary functions with ease. However, there could be improvements in terms of visuals and design to make it more appealing to a wider audience. Step 2: Evaluating the Functionality When it comes to functionality, the app delivers on its promise - allowing users to embed secret messages within images. The encryption and decryption processes are relatively straightforward, although sometimes the app can take a substantial amount of time to process the images, which may frustrate some users. Step 3: Assessing Security Measures In terms of security, I appreciate the fact that PixelKnot employs various security features, including password protection for messages and the utilization of the F5 algorithm for steganography. However, there are a few concerns about the app's open-source nature, which can have both positive and negative implications on security depending on the user's perspective. Step 4: Reviewing the App's Updates and Maintenance Keeping an app up-to-date with bug fixes and new features is essential for maintaining user satisfaction. PixelKnot seems to receive updates somewhat infrequently, which leaves users wondering whether the app is still being maintained and if all security aspects are up-to-date. In conclusion, the PixelKnot app is functional and reasonably secure, but it could benefit from design improvements, faster processing times, and more frequent updates. Thus, I find it adequate to give the app a 3-star rating out of 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has a pocket watch identical to the one Johnny is given? from the following article ? Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who has a pocket watch identical to the one Johnny is given is Guido Marchettis. Nelle, Guido's wife, gives Johnny the custom pocket watch, which is a twin of the birthday present she gave her husband."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fact 2: Insect Pollinators Learn about pollination and why insect pollinators are important in the garden. Given the two facts above, what are important in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants?.? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts above, insect pollinators are important in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants. Pollination is a crucial process in the life cycle of flowering plants, as it allows for the transfer of genetic material (pollen) from the male parts (anthers) of a flower to the female parts (stigma) of the same or another flower. This transfer of pollen is vital for plants to produce seeds, which grow into new plants, ensuring their survival and reproduction. Insect pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies, play a significant role in the pollination process. These insects visit flowers to feed on nectar and/or pollen, and in doing so, they inadvertently pick up pollen from the anthers and transfer it to the stigmas of other flowers, facilitating fertilization. Insect pollinators are important in the garden because they help in the production of fruits, vegetables, and other plant products that humans and animals rely on for food. Additionally, they contribute to the biodiversity and overall health of ecosystems, as pollination leads to the production of seeds and helps ensure the continuation of various plant species. In summary, insect pollinators are essential in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants, as they facilitate the transfer of pollen from the male to the female parts of flowers, enabling the production of seeds and the growth of new plants. Their role in pollination directly impacts the availability of food resources for humans and wildlife, and supports the maintenance of diverse and healthy ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: From hitting the mall with your girl friends on a Saturday afternoon, to holiday spending on gifts that go under the tree, shopping could be called one of America's favorite pastimes. For most people, it means some new clothes for work or a small trinket for a friend. For others, however, shopping is much more than an enjoyable pastime, and in some cases, it is a real and destructive addiction that can turn into a financial disaster. Compulsive shopping and spending are defined as inappropriate, excessive, and out of control. Like other addictions, it basically has something to do with impulsiveness and lack of control over one's impulses. In America, shopping is embedded in our culture; so often, the impulsiveness comes out as excessive shopping. Sometimes this is referred to as \\"shopholism\\". Shopping addiction can damage a person's life, family, and finances. \\"No one knows what causes addictive behaviors, like shopping, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling\\", says a professor of applied health science. Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic predisposition to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is triggered, but no one really knows why.\\" Individuals will get some kind of high from an addictive behavior like shopping.

Q: Question: Where was the person who Stevens worked under in 1929 born? Passage:Stevens grew up in Sydney and was an accountant and public servant before entering politics. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1927 state election, as a member of the Nationalist Party. In 1929, he was appointed state treasurer under Thomas Bavin, serving until his party lost the 1930 election. In 1932, Stevens was elected as the inaugural leader of the state branch of the UAP. He became premier later that year, following the dismissal of Labor's Jack Lang, and subsequently led his party to victory at the 1932, 1935, and 1938 elections. Stevens was ousted in 1939 and replaced by Alexander Mair. He made an abortive attempt to enter federal politics at the 1940 election, and thereafter played little part in public life.

It is being used more in the traditional or colloquial sense to refer to someone's departure from a location or situation. 2) On the other hand, in \\"The applicant now seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, to appeal against these sentences.\\", the term \\"leave\\" is being used in a legal context. Here, it means seeking permission or approval. The applicant is asking for the court's permission to appeal against the sentences.

Terrible customer service. I was quoted a price of ~40 for a battery warranty replacement over the phone. I drove to the shop (which is 30 minutes from where i live), and was promptly greeted by a technician who tested by battery to confirm that it needed replacement. The battery did need replacement, so a sales associate ushered me inside to pay for the new battery. The associate selects the battery, rings up the purchase, and adds a 20 installation fee. Up until this point, my experience had been very pleasant. I told the associate that the price I had been quoted on the phone did not include an installation fee. He said that it was a standard fee, and I again stated that an installation fee had not be quoted to me over the phone. He said that I could take the battery and install it myself, but that I would have to return the old battery to the shop. I told him that while I was happy to install the battery myself, driving 30 minutes back to their shop to return a car battery was not convenient. He ran into the shop, to stop the technician from removing my old battery. I waited... a different associate returned. This new associate was pushy and abrasive. He told me that I had two options: 1) to pay them 20 to install the battery now or 2) to pay full price (120) for a new battery, install it at home, and return the defective battery to their store (requiring an additional hour of driving on my part) to receive the warranty credit. I again told this technician that an installation fee had not been quoted to me over the phone and paying full price for the battery now to get a credit later also had not been quoted to me. He said because I told him driving an extra hour roundtrip to return the battery was inconvenient, he would not give me the warranty credit because I was unlikely to return the defective battery. I told the associate that neither of these choices was the option quoted to me over the phone. He said that he didn't have a technician in the shop that was willing to work for free, so he could not waive the installation fee (although if the battery had been less than 3 yrs old instead of 3.25 yrs old, installation on replacement batteries is free). I have no problem with installation fees as long as they are quoted to customers. This allows the customer to make an informed decision. Because this fee was not included in my quote, I opted to drive to Sears to get a replacement battery. IF YOU DON'T QUOTE AN INSTALLATION FEE, DON'T CHARGE ONE! This is the mistake of the shop, not the customer, so the shop should fix it. The associate made no attempt to correct the mistake. Instead they were pushy and unflexible.

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year.

New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Thy Serpent is a Finnish black metal band from Espoo.

President Barack Obama will launch a coordinated campaign Tuesday by the White House, congressional Democrats and their outside allies to return attention to why the Affordable Care Act passed in the first place. After two months of intense coverage of the botched HealthCare.gov rollout, the president will host a White House event kicking off a three-week drive to refocus the public on the law’s benefits, senior administration officials told POLITICO. Text Size - + reset W.H. returns to Obamacare sales mode — Jim VandeHei reports In 90 secs: What's driving the day The White House will take the lead in emphasizing a different benefit each day until the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for Jan. 1 coverage. The daily message will be amplified through press events and social media by Democratic members of Congress, the Democratic National Committee, congressional campaign committees and advocacy organizations, officials said. (Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage) The fresh push is an attempt to get back to the game plan that Democrats wanted to pursue before the faulty website forced them into full-time damage control. The president needs to rebuild confidence in the law among the public and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, who have threatened to roll back aspects of Obamacare if the insurance marketplace didn’t improve quickly — and refocus attention on what would be lost if it were repealed. Now that the website appears to be mostly functional, the West Wing thinks it has the ability to return to sales mode. “Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline and even as we continue to make improvements to the website, we’ll also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans today,” said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman. “The benefits of these consumer protections will only accumulate in the weeks and months ahead.” (POLITICO Magazine: How the media missed the two biggest Obamacare screw-ups) Obama won’t declare the website fixed during Tuesday’s event. White House officials acknowledge HealthCare.gov still isn’t working as smoothly as it should, and that this renewed messaging push will run alongside efforts to make further repairs to the insurance marketplace and to target key populations for enrollment. But he will return to a theme he first pursued in October: Obamacare is more than a website. “What the White House is doing is what the White House had hoped they would spend the last two months doing, which is going out, selling the law, selling the benefits of the law,” said a former Obama adviser who framed the shift as a sign of White House confidence. “The fact that they feel comfortable doing that is a healthy sign for the president but also for the long-term benefits of Obamacare.” Republicans aren’t expected back down from their campaign to weaken the law, and officials said they have been preparing for the Democratic offensive. “Democrats will spend the next year promising to ‘fix’ ObamaCare, but they’ve already lost all credibility with voters,” said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which has already cut a web ad aimed at vulnerable Democrats that concludes with the message: “They can’t be trusted to keep their promises.” (PHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout) The focus on Obamacare benefits is a political necessity for congressional Democrats, the large majority of whom will face voters in less than a year. Democrats wrote and passed the law in the face of unified Republican opposition, and if voters aren’t aware of the law’s upside — or can’t remember it amid all the problems with the rollout — Democrats will be holding onto an anchor rather than a buoy. Democrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill say that in order to get back on offense on Obamacare, they have to draw a two-sided picture: Democrats delivering benefits on one side, and Republicans trying to deny them on the other. That, one party operative said, is what polling says will help them win. Instead, Democrats have spent the past two months blaming a president of their own party for the deficiencies of a law that they own. Now, Democratic leaders are welcoming the renewed White House push. “The consequences of Republican repeal are exactly the case that we need to be making — because Republican repeal would take us backward to a broken system that hurts too many Americans — like forcing millions of seniors to pay 1,200 more for their prescription drugs,” said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Every poll tells us that when we make that case, voters choose Democrats.” On Wednesday, the White House and Democratic allies will focus on how Americans are paying less for preventative care under Obamacare. On Thursday, they’ll highlight that people with preexisting conditions can no longer be charged more or denied coverage. And on Friday, they’ll emphasize the slowing growth in health care costs. ”We are able to hit reset on the conversation,” said Lori Lodes, senior vice president of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. “We have to make sure people understand how the law will benefit them.” Follow @politico ||||| President Obama declared Tuesday that ObamaCare \\"is working\\" and that \\"we're not going back,\\" as the White House looked to reboot its efforts to sell Americans on the president's signature healthcare law. ADVERTISEMENT Obama said that \\"poor execution\\" of the rollout of HealthCare.gov had \\"clouded\\" the benefits of the bill but said he would not allow technical glitches to undermine a program that was providing financial security for many Americans. \\"If I've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works, that's what we'll do,\\" Obama said. \\"We're not repealing it as long as I'm president,\\" he added. \\"I want everybody to be clear about that. We'll make it work.\\" The president, flanked by supporters who had benefited from aspects of the law, vacillated between a defense of his much-criticized program and a sales pitch intended to highlight some of ObamaCare's benefits for ordinary families. Obama shared stories of individuals who had been helped by provisions of the law that provided them with free preventive care, and allowed those younger than 26 to remain on their parents' health insurance. Acknowledging that the benefits of the program had \\"gotten lost a little bit,\\" the president urged attendees to tell their friends and families about the law's success stories. \\"It working better now, and it's just going to keep on working better over time,\\" Obama said. In his remarks, the president shied away from directly addressing more recent critiques of the ObamaCare website, including reports that the portal was continuing to provide insurers with error-riddled enrollment information. Obama did say that as new problems arose, the administration would address them. \\"Whatever comes up, we're going to fix it,\\" he said, adding later that the White House had \\"learned not to make wild promises about how perfectly smooth it's going to be.\\" The president also chastised critics of the law, saying Republicans \\"haven't presented an alternative\\" that would address flaws of the pre-ObamaCare system. He singled out Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), saying the Republican leader \\"refused to answer\\" when asked what his alternate proposal was. \\"He just repeated 'repeal' over and over and over again,\\" Obama said. Earlier Tuesday, McConnell said the president's \\"campaign-style event wouldn’t solve the myriad problems facing consumers under ObamaCare.\\" “The American people have been learning about the impact ObamaCare will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums, disrupted insurance, and lost jobs — more broken promises from the administration. And they’re becoming increasingly aware of the fact ObamaCare is broken beyond repair,\\" McConnell said. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the president's event was the first of many in a \\"renewed effort to refocus the public and the public's attention on the benefits of the law.\\" Carney said that in the coming days, the president and other White House officials would talk about existing benefits under ObamaCare, including insurance plans mandating free preventive care, ending discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and the curbed growth in healthcare costs. The White House spokesman said that sales effort would use \\"a number of different venues,\\" including press events and Internet advertising campaigns. \\"This is an opportunity now that the website is functioning effectively for the vast majority of users and we are seeing high volume, and high volume being handled effectively by the website, and people enrolling that it's an opportune time to talk about, again, the actual benefits that are provided by the law,\\" Carney said. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"President Barack Obama wanted to remind people about the good things that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) does for them, because there were some problems with the HealthCare.gov website when it started.

I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he’s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. “One of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

However, if you're looking to gather your own pine shells, then you should know that it's a lengthy process that can take months. Pick your answer from: + Remember that pine nuts are hard, so buy specialized nut casings that can last longer. If you're buying seeds, make sure to use organic allergen-free pellets to get soft pine nuts for best results. + Chop two, three, five, or seven of the walnuts into tiny pieces. Use a mortar and pestle or similar tool to break up as many pine nuts as possible. + Here's what you have to do : For the gray pine, you should collect the cones in september or october and keep them in an airy, but dry place, such as a garage. The cones should still be tightly closed at this point. + Be prepared to specify that you will not eat the nuts you purchased, even if they look as if they're ripe. When possible, opt for a strip of unshelled pine nuts instead of a cluster of fine pine nuts.","completion":"Here's what you have to do: For the gray pine, you should collect the cones in September or October and keep them in an airy, but dry place, such as a garage.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A drink of water is just a matter of turning on a tap for most of us. However, water for those in drought-stricken northwestern China can't be taken for granted. Its present shortage is a matter of life and death to them. The tragedy is the direct result of the drought that has hit a large area of northwestern China, and is affecting more than 50 million people. The drought began last spring, ravaging Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi. Experts say the drought is a result of less rainfall, insufficient water reserves, high temperatures, dated irrigation projects, environmental damage and global climate change. More than 15 million people are having difficulties getting safe drinking water. The drought is also affecting schoolchildren's studies. \\"I am worried that my family will get no harvest this year. In that case, my family will not be able to afford my living costs,\\" an unnamed boarding schoolgirl at Naqing Primary School in Shandan, Zhangye, told Dazhong Daily. But thanks to measures taken under the leadership of the central government, the drinking water problem has been greatly eased. Each person in the five worst-hit provinces is being supplied with drinking water and 20 liters of water for other purposes each day. Local authorities are digging deep wells and creating artificial rain. Military personnel are helping to transport water from others province to Gansu and Qinghai, according to CCTV. In Shaanxi, locals are turning to drought resistant crops. Other parts of China are helping by giving water and donating other resources.
