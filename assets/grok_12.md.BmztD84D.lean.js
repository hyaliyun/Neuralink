Write highlights for this article: The ninth and 10th suspects arrested in a series of anti-gay beatings in New York were arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court Tuesday evening. Jose Dominguez, 22, who was arrested early Tuesday morning, was charged with sexual abuse, gang assault in the first and second degree, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment, according to the complaint filed in court. Ruddy Vargas-Perez, 22, was charged with 10 charges including four counts of robbery, gang assault in the second degree, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment, according to the complaint. His bail was set at 25,000. Despite the complaint stating the 10 charges brought against Vargas-Perez, his attorney, Benjamin Heinrich, maintains his client is only charged with robbery. \\"He had nothing to do with any of that horrific conduct and he was as mortified as we all are by what happened to that poor man,\\" Heinrich said. \\"And we see that he hasn't been charged with that.\\" The courtroom was packed with Vargas-Perez' family and friends who gathered outside after the arraignment holding signs with his picture and chanting, \\"Ruddy.\\" \\"We said it once and we'll say it again, that my brother was innocent through all this time and he was not guilty. And we deserve an apology from the government,\\" said his brother, Raul Sweeney. Vargas-Perez was taken into custody late Monday afternoon, the New York Police Department said. Heinrich told reporters his client was \\"absolutely not\\" involved in the October 3 attacks. Of the other eight suspects in the attacks, six have been ordered held without bail and bail for two others has been set at 100,000. The case involved three victims being held against their will by as many as 10 assailants who beat them in a vacant apartment and sodomized two of them, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday. A fourth victim was beaten and robbed in connection with the attacks, which New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg described as \\"torture.\\" \\"I was sickened by the brutal nature of these crimes and saddened at the anti-gay bias that contributed to them,\\" Bloomberg said Saturday. \\"Hate crimes such as these strike fear into all of us.\\" The string of attacks began when members of a street gang calling themselves the Latin King Goonies learned that an aspiring member is gay, authorities said. According to Kelly, the 17-year-old pledge was forced into an unoccupied apartment around 3:30 a.m. Sunday and questioned about his contact with a 30-year-old man. He was thrown into a wall, forced to strip naked, hit in the head with a beer can, cut with a box cutter and sodomized with the wooden handle of a plunger, the commissioner said. His assailants let him go, but threatened to hurt him or his family if he talked, Kelly said. The victim went to a hospital for treatment, but claimed his injuries were from an attack by unknown assailants on the street, the commissioner said. The same day, another 17-year-old was beaten and questioned about the same 30-year-old man, robbed of jewelry and held against his will in the same vacant apartment, Kelly said. About an hour after that, the 30-year-old man was lured to the location where the second 17-year-old was being held, was forced to strip naked and was tied to a chair opposite the teenager, Kelly said. The teenager was forced to hit the older male several times in the face and burn him with cigarettes, after which the suspects assaulted him with their fists and a chain and sodomized him with a small baseball bat, the commissioner said. The 30-year-old man was later dumped outside his home, he added. Five of the suspects then went to the apartment the 30-year-old victim shared with his older brother and let themselves in using a key they'd taken from the man, Kelly explained. They beat the man's brother and demanded money from him. When he refused, the assailants put a cell phone to his ear and he heard his younger brother say that he was being held against his will and to \\"give them the money,\\" the commissioner said. The older brother told the suspects where they could find the money, after which they tied him up and left the apartment, Kelly added. All ten of the suspects live in the Bronx, police said. The hate crimes task force took over the investigation, Kelly said, and coordinated with the Bronx Gang Division and Bronx Special Victims Squad to help identify and capture the suspects. Pending charges against them include unlawful imprisonment, abduction, sodomy, assault, robbery, and menacing, all as hate crimes, the commissioner said. The crimes and arrests have attracted national attention. \\"It is tragic to see what hate can do,\\" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, said Saturday. \\"These three men were brutally attacked ... simply for who they are.\\" CNN's Elise Zeiger, Christina Romano, Susan Candiotti and Julie Cannold contributed to this report.","completion":"- Two more suspects, Jose Dominguez (22) and Ruddy Vargas-Perez (22), were arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court for their alleged involvement in a series of anti-gay beatings in New York. - Dominguez faces charges including sexual abuse, gang assault, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment. - Vargas-Perez faces 10 charges, including four counts of robbery, gang assault, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment.

Maybe 10,000 We’re used to comparison shopping, and we know where we can get a better deal on the exact same box of cereal or the same pair of sneakers. But when it comes to the routine blood test you get every time you see the doctor, how budget-conscious can you be? Not very, new research shows. In an eye-opening report published in the journal BMJ Open, Dr. Renee Hsia, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues found that cholesterol panel could cost patients anywhere from 10 to 10,169 — a more than thousand-fold difference. A basic metabolic test for things like blood sugar ranged from 35 to 7,303. “I was expecting a little variation, maybe two-fold, or even three-fold,” says Hsia, who also studied differences in total costs for procedures like having the appendix or tonsils removed. “But I wasn’t expecting this amount.” She focused specifically on blood tests because they are automated and not prone to variations in the quality of the technician or other bells and whistles required to spit out results. “It should be like buying a loaf of bread,” she says, with only slight differences in price. MORE: An End to Medical-Billing Secrecy? But the thousand-fold range shows just how seemingly random health care pricing can be. “There is probably nothing justifiable [for the high cost] in this case,” she says. Even if the most talented technician were performing the lipid analysis using the most sophisticated machine, it’s hard to imagine those services requiring 10,000 worth of equipment or labor. And it’s not as if individual hospitals are guilty of overcharging consistently. One hospital may have high fees for one test and lower fees for others. In Hsia’s study of 150 California hospitals, the one that charged more than 10,000 for the cholesterol test was not the same one that billed more than 7,000 for a metabolic test. Factoring in things such as whether the hospital was for- or not-for-profit, whether it was a teaching hospital, and the percentage of patients covered by Medicaid still didn’t explain the gap in pricing. MORE: Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us Master lists at each hospital set these fees, she says, and in recent years, some hospital administrators have admitted that even quantitative factors such as supply, demand or overhead costs don’t factor into these prices. In 2013, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius released the prices of 100 of the most common inpatient services at hospitals across the country in an effort to make the process more transparent. And if you think you won’t have to worry about these prices because you’re insured, you may be feeling these costs the next time your premium creeps up. While private insurers negotiate with hospitals to accept certain fees, that rate is a percentage of the original charge — the higher the charge, the higher that negotiated fee will be. And insurers pass on those costs to their members. So can a financially responsible patient comparison shop for hospitals with the most reasonable fees? Not really. California law mandates that hospital report what they charge for any 25 of the most common outpatient tests. But they don’t specify what those tests are, and hospitals can chose which ones they provide to the public. The entire list of fees is also available, but not as easy to navigate for patients who aren’t familiar with the codes for the tests. “It’s not that transparent, and hard for patients to access the information,” says Hsia. “When people hear about price variation, they say it’s probably just one hospital, or one blood test or one procedure, and they think it’s the exception rather than the rule,” says Hsia. But evidence is mounting that’s not the case. “It’s not a hospital issue, it’s a fundamental problem because there is not a rational way to determine hospital pricing, and that needs to be addressed.”","completion":"A news article talks about how much a blood test can cost, and it says that the price can be anywhere between 10 to 10,000. The article explains that hospitals charge different prices for blood tests, and it is hard for patients to know how much they will have to pay. This makes it difficult for patients to save money by choosing a cheaper hospital for their blood test. The article suggests that the way hospitals decide their prices should be made clearer, so people can make better choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: NHS hospitals have resorted to asking zoos and vets to scan patients who are too obese to fit into hospital scanners. The bizarre requests to use CT scanners, normally intended for four-legged animals, at the UK’s leading veterinary college in north London were revealed as hospitals face pressure to adapt beds and wards for an increasingly obese population. The Royal Veterinary College (RVC)yesterday said its CT scanners, customised for horses, could be used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would need to get a special licence to scan humans. CT scanners usually used by zoos and vet for horses could help scan obese human patients. Riaz Dharamshi, a geriatric registrar. at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London, said he was told to. refer obese patients to London Zoo when he was training. The practice of referring patients to zoos is commonplace in America where obesity has reached epidemic levels. Writing on his blog, he said ‘Imagine. the humiliation for the patient. ‘I’m sorry sir but you are too fat to. have a CT scan, so we are going to have to send you to the zoo where. they are used to dealing with larger specimens.’' However a spokesperson from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which oversees. St Mary's Hospital, said: 'We have never referred or been asked to. refer a patient to London Zoo or the Royal Veterinary College for. scanning.' London Zoo also denied taking obese. patients but a spokeswoman for the Royal Veterinary College confirmed. they have been approached. She said ‘We have been approached on several occasions but have always said we are only licensed to perform scans on animals.’ It is not known whether any veterinary colleges are seeking licenses to perform the procedure. Hospitals face pressure to adapt equipment for Britain's obese population. Dr Dharamshi added ‘Some bright spark decided it would be a good idea to up the loading capacity of the tables we use in the CT scanners, so the problem of having patients too big to scan is not one we face all that often. ‘Wheelchairs are wider, theatre operating tables are stronger and we have access to reinforced hospital beds when we need them. Being overweight has become the norm.’ The CT scanner at the RVC is housed in the equine hospital and is used with a specially built table to support anaesthetised horses. CT scans are used by doctors to assess body fat as well as for more general health checks to see if anything is wrong. Briatin’s fire crews have spent millions on callouts by the NHS in recent years shifting obese patients who have got stuck in the bath or their bedrooms, or who cannot be safely lifted by ambulance staff. A report last year warned the NHS is ‘poorly prepared’ to deal with obese patients, lacking staff and equipment to care for them safely. Bigger trolley, beds and wheelchairs are needed – with more than half of women and almost two thirds of men likely to be obese by 2050, according to official estimates. The report found incidents involved equipment not being able to take the weight of obese patients, with specially adapted equipment either not being available or normal equipment not working properly when used with obese patients.","completion":"Some hospitals in the UK are asking zoos and vets to help scan patients who are too big to fit into normal hospital scanners. These hospitals want to use CT scanners meant for animals like horses. This is because more and more people are getting very big and hospitals need to change their beds and equipment to help them. Some vets have been asked if they can help, but they need a special permission to do scans for people. This shows that being overweight is becoming more common and hospitals need to be ready to help bigger patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, with the right care and styling techniques, you can flaunt your gorgeous curls and embrace your natural hair. In this article, we'll go over some essential tips on how to work with your curly hair and maintain it in the best possible manner. 1. Find a stylist who works with your type of hair The first step to managing curly hair is finding a hair stylist who specializes in working with your hair type. Not every stylist has experience with curly hair, and the wrong cut or style can make a significant difference in your hair's appearance. Look for someone who understands your hair's unique needs and can provide suggestions on the best styles and cuts for you. 2. Avoid washing your hair every day Washing curly hair daily can strip it of its natural oils, which are essential for maintaining moisture and keeping your hair healthy. Instead, opt for washing your hair every few days or even once a week, depending on your hair type and personal preference. Using a gentle shampoo specifically designed for curly hair will also help retain your hair's natural moisture. 3. Pick a hydrating conditioner and let it soak in One of the critical steps in curly hair care is adequately conditioning your hair. A hydrating conditioner will help replenish the moisture that curly hair naturally loses. Apply the conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends, and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing to allow your hair to absorb the product. 4. Comb your hair when it's wet Curly hair is more prone to breakage and tangles than other hair types. To prevent damage, gently comb through your wet hair with a wide-toothed comb, starting from the ends and working your way up. This method will help you avoid any unnecessary breakage and make your hair easier to manage. 5. Apply styling products on damp hair Applying styling products to damp hair allows for better distribution of the product, ensuring that each strand is coated and protected. This method helps you avoid using excessive amounts of product, which can weigh your hair down and make it appear greasy. 6. Experiment with different products It can take some trial and error to find the perfect combination of products for your unique hair type. Don't be afraid to experiment with different shampoos, conditioners, and styling products to see what works best for you. Pay attention to how your hair reacts to each product, and adjust your routine accordingly. 7. Be mindful of straightening and heat styling While it may be tempting to reach for the straightener or curling iron, heat styling can cause significant damage to your curly hair. If you must use heat, do so sparingly and always use a heat protectant spray. Consider alternative styling methods, such as braids or buns, that can help you achieve a different look without causing damage. 8. Patience after a chemical relaxer If you've decided to grow out your curls after a chemical relaxer, remember that it will take time for your natural hair to grow. Be patient and stay committed to properly caring for your hair during this transition period. You may experience breakage or a noticeable difference in textures, but with proper care and time, your natural curls will make a beautiful reappearance. Conclusion Embracing your natural curly hair can be an empowering and enjoyable experience. By understanding your hair's unique needs and following these styling tips, you'll be well on your way to rocking stunning, healthy curls. So go ahead and flaunt your gorgeous curls with pride!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Northwestern University in Illinois preparing to exhibit collection. The archive includes at least one artifact. dating to the 16th century. Includes 'spirit' photographs with images of living and dead people. Article:","completion":"Title: The Haunting Legacy: Michael McDowell's Collection of Post-Mortem Photography Exhibition In an upcoming exhibition at Northwestern University in Illinois, visitors will be immersed in the eerie world of Michael McDowell's extensive collection of post-mortem photography. Spanning three decades, McDowell, a renowned author, has meticulously amassed hundreds of photographs depicting deceased individuals, offering a chilling yet fascinating look at the history of post-mortem photography. These macabre images once played a significant role in the grieving process, as they were often the only means for families to preserve the memories of their loved ones. Ranging from the discreetly posed to the grotesquely displayed, the photos in McDowell's collection offer invaluable insights into the cultural and social norms surrounding death and mourning in diverse societies and time periods. The exhibition itself will feature photographs dating back to the 16th century, with at least one artifact standing as a testament to the antiquity of this haunting practice. As the selection spans centuries, it allows viewers the opportunity to observe the evolution of post-mortem photography from its earliest origins to its modern-day iterations. One of the most intriguing aspects of McDowell's collection is the inclusion of 'spirit' photographs, in which the living and the dead are captured alongside each other. These images were created during the spiritualist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when photographers claimed they could communicate with the deceased through their cameras. Often staged through various techniques such as double exposure or manipulated glass plates, these photographs played on people's fascination with the possibility of an afterlife and a desire to connect with those who had passed on. The Northwestern University exhibition will provide visitors with an in-depth exploration of the cultural context, artistic styles, and techniques used to produce these captivating images. In doing so, the exhibition aims to shed light on the ways in which society's perceptions of and relationship with death have shifted over time, while also questioning our own collective understanding of and attitudes towards mortality. A visit to the Michael McDowell collection of post-mortem photography promises to be a thought-provoking and emotionally-charged experience. As the viewer is confronted with the stark realities of death and grief, they are also invited to reflect on each portrait subject's life and the legacy they left behind. This powerful collection not only contextualizes death within a historical framework but also challenges us to consider the significance of memory, loss, and mourning in our own lives. In its entirety, the exhibition is a celebration of Michael McDowell's dedication to preserving this unique aspect of our cultural history. Be prepared to be moved, fascinated, and perhaps even haunted, as you delve into the realm of the afterlife through McDowell's extraordinary archive. Mark your calendars and make your way to Northwestern University in Illinois to embark on this remarkable visual journey through time and death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking.

Title: Emperor of the North Movie plot: Driven to desperation by the economic depression of 1930s America, a subculture of hobos hopped freight trains to get from place to place in search of jobs, handouts, or even to take it easy sometimes. Emperor of the North Pole depicts a microcosm of this subculture set in Oregon, and actually used the Oregon, Pacific & Eastern railroad which was taken up in 1994 like so much other trackage around the country. Thus, this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of American history, but into a specific piece of it in the Pacific Northwest.The film opens with the mechanical star, 2-8-2 steam locomotive #19, stopping to take on water while a hobo who calls himself \\"A-#1\\" looks on in anticipation of hopping this local train. Meanwhile, the conductor, \\"Shack\\", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death. This sets the tone for the movie. The single-minded, almost hateful Shack bound and determined to prevent anyone from riding his train versus the veteran hobo A-#1 bound and determined to ride the 19 train. Each has his reputation at stake.A-#1 manages to hop aboard and hide in a cattle car undetected, but a greenhorn punk who calls himself \\"Cigaret\\" gives him away as he, too, climbs into the same car.

More than three months later, the federal agency overseen by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke issued a letter dated March 1 announcing that the importation of elephant trophies will now be approved on a \\"case-by-case basis.\\" The letter cites a December ruling in a long-running lawsuit challenging the ban filed by Safari Club International and the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association. Zinke recently told people privately that Trump has called him several times to discuss what to do about elephant trophies. Neither the Interior Department nor Fish and Wildlife issued a media release over the last week to announce the decision, which was quickly condemned by environmental advocates, reports the AP, which has more on the situation here.","completion":"Title: Trump Administration Quietly Lifts Ban on Importing African Elephant Trophies Introduction: In an unannounced move that has environmental advocates concerned, the Trump administration has decided to allow Americans to import body parts of African elephants shot for sport. This change in policy comes more than three months after President Trump placed the decision on hold, following public uproar over the practice. Despite previously referring to it as a \\"horror show,\\" the administration now plans to approve the importation of elephant trophies on a case-by-case basis. Critics argue that lifting the Obama-era ban will encourage wealthy big-game hunters to kill the threatened species while compromising the conservation efforts for African elephants. Background: In November 2017, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to lift an Obama-era ban that prohibited Americans from importing the body parts of African elephants shot for sport in Zimbabwe and Zambia. The agency argued that encouraging wealthy big-game hunters to kill the threatened species would help raise money for conservation programs. However, President Trump personally intervened, placing the policy on hold and tweeting, \\"Will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.\\" The Change in Policy: Over three months after the initial announcement, the federal agency overseen by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke issued a letter dated March 1, 2021, stating that the importation of elephant trophies will now be approved on a case-by-case basis. The decision to lift the ban is said to be influenced by a December ruling in a long-running lawsuit filed by Safari Club International and the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association challenging the ban. Lack of Public Announcement: Unlike earlier instances when such decisions were announced through media releases, neither the Interior Department nor the Fish and Wildlife issued a media statement to announce the decision. According to the Associated Press (AP), the communication only came to light after fact-checkers from the news organization noticed changes on the agency's website. Critics of the Decision: Environmental advocates were quick to condemn the decision, arguing that the Trump administration's move is a significant setback to elephant conservation efforts. Animal rights groups and activists have expressed concerns over the potential increase in poaching incidents targeting one of Africa's most iconic and threatened species, the African elephant, which has seen a drastic decline in numbers due to illegal hunting for ivory and habitat loss. Conclusion: The Trump administration's quiet decision to lift the ban on importing African elephant trophies continues to raise concerns amongst environmental advocates and animal rights groups. The unannounced move, which contradicts President Trump's previous stand on the matter, now places the fate of the African elephant in the hands of case-by-case approvals and is likely to significantly impact conservation efforts for the threatened species moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We are given the equation: 0 = 45042 * f - 45448 * f - 6902 Now, we want to find the value of 'f'. Let's break down the problem. First, look at the two terms with f in them: 45042 * f and - 45448 * f. Both terms are multiplied by f, so we can combine them. Let's do that: (45042 - 45448) * f This is the same as: -406 * f Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -406 * f - 6902 Since we want to find f, let's isolate 'f' by moving the other numbers to the opposite side of the equation. To do that, let's first move the -6902 to the other side by adding 6902 to both sides: 0 + 6902 = -406 * f - 6902 + 6902 This simplifies to: 6902 = -406 * f Now, we must get rid of the -406 multiplied with f to find the value of f alone. So, we have to divide both sides of the equation by -406: 6902 / -406 = (-406 * f) / -406 This simplifies to: f = -17 So, the value of 'f' in this math problem is -17.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. And then even if you do come and visit me you 'll be in a relationship . I ' m not saying give me another chance because I already had one . I just had to tell you how I feel . What would the narrator do if they were given another chance ?","completion":"Based on the limited information given in the article, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what the narrator would do if they were given another chance. However, we can still infer certain possibilities from the context and the emotions expressed by the narrator. The narrator acknowledges that they have already had a chance with the person they are addressing, which might suggest that they were involved in a romantic relationship or had an opportunity to start one. They also mention that if the addressee comes to visit them, the addressee will be in a relationship, which seems to indicate that they are no longer a viable romantic opportunity for the narrator. Despite this, the narrator feels compelled to share their emotions, which express their longing and perhaps even regret for the way their previous chance unfolded. Given that the narrator is making this emotional confession, it can be inferred that if they were granted another chance, they would likely take a different approach to their relationship or the opportunity to be in one with the addressee. With another chance, the narrator might: 1. Be more open and honest about their feelings from the beginning, to ensure that both parties understand each other's emotions and intentions. 2. Make more of an effort to secure and maintain the relationship, possibly investing more time, energy, and care into nurturing a strong foundation. 3. Learn from whatever mistakes or faults led to their past opportunity falling through and work on personal growth to become a better partner, implementing these improvements in their renewed relationship. 4. Prioritize the relationship and the addressee's needs, demonstrating that they value and cherish the connection they have, as well as the second chance they've been lucky enough to receive. While there is no guarantee that a second chance would result in a successful relationship, the narrator may seek to make the most of the opportunity by addressing past missteps, cultivating a stronger bond, and fostering open communication with their partner."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Input: Passage: The Morris Brothers were born in Old Fort, North Carolina. Originally, they began performing as a trio together with a third brother, George Morris. In 1933, Zeke moved to Concord and joined J. E. Mainer's Crazy Mountaineers He made his first recordings with the Mountaineers in August 1935 för Bluebird Records. Four years later, in 1937, Wiley and Zeke along with banjo player Wade Mainer did some radio work in the North Carolina towns of Asheville and Raleigh. In April 1938, The Morris Brothers, fiddler Homer Sherrill and banjo player Joel Martin, calling themselves the Smilin' Rangers, performed at radio station WBTM in Danville, Virginia. In September 1938, Zeke recorded with Charlie Monroe as a replacement for Bill Monroe just after the Monroe Brothers had disbanded. The same year, Zeke's musical career came to a halt when he went to work in a cotton mill in Gastonia. In 1939, the brothers moved to Asheville and WWNC radio, where they resumed their career. After World War II they retired and opened an auto repair business. Between 1938 and 1939, the Morris Brothers made 36 recordings for RCA Victor.

Q: In Iraq, John Triton (John Cena) of the United States Marine Corps is closing in on an al-Qaeda hideout. There are only 3 hostages. Those 3 hostages are actually Marines. Disregarding direct orders to wait for reinforcement, Triton attacks the extremists and rescues his Comrades. The next morning, his colonel informs Triton that he is being honorably discharged for disobeying direct orders.Home from Iraq, Triton finds it hard to settle back in to normal life. He is fired from his job as a security guard for using excessive force on an employee's ex-boyfriend and his bodyguards. Triton should not have thrown the guy through a window. It is still hilarious that the window broke. Triton's wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) decides the two need a vacation to help Triton adjust to his new life. Meanwhile, criminal Rome (Robert Patrick) robs a jewelry store with his gang: girlfriend Angela (Abigail Bianca), Morgan (Anthony Ray Parker), Vescera (Damon Gibson), and Bennett (Manu Bennett). Rome is in collusion with an anonymous partner, with whom he is planning on sharing the profits from the diamonds. On the run, the gang stops at a gas station where Triton and Kate have stopped. When two policemen arrive to buy gas, Morgan shoots and kills one of the officers, causing Rome to shoot the other officer while Angela kills the gas station attendant. When Triton reacts to Kate being kidnapped, Bennett knocks him out. Triton regains consciousness and gives chase in the policemen's car. The chase leads to a lake, where Triton falls out of the patrol car and into the lake, seemingly to his death.Rome and his gang walk through a swamp to avoid the police. Kate tries to escape several times. Triton emerges from the lake to find Detective Van Buren, who is pursuing the gang. Van Buren denies Triton permission to pursue the gang, but Triton heads into the swamp anyway. After an altercation between Morgan and Vescera, Rome decides to kill Vescera. Rome gets a call from his anonymous partner, and Rome tells him that he intends to cut the partner out of the deal.The gang arrives at a lodge and decide to rest there for the time being. Meanwhile, Triton is kidnapped by two fugitives who believe he is a police officer looking for them. He subdues them and tracks the gang to the lodge.

Triton makes a narrow escape, having been blown into the swamp.Rome escapes in Van Buren's car, but abandons it due to a police tracking device. Angela seduces then kills a truck driver for his truck. Triton is arrested by a marine patrol officer, but steals the officer's vessel after handcuffing him. He races to the marina that is Rome's destination, jumping on Rome's truck, throwing Angela into the windshield of an oncoming bus, killing her and spilling the diamonds. Rome scrapes Triton off the truck by driving into the side of a building, careening through a warehouse, then leaps out just before the truck crashes into a lake. Triton then stumbles out, leaving Rome in the fiery warehouse, then rescues Kate, who is drowning in the truck. A badly-burned Rome returns and tries to choke Triton with a chain.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\" After reading the above, is \\"Women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets.

Write an article based on this summary: Cameroon has banned the wearing of full-face Islamic veil, including the burka, in the Far North region, following two suicide bomb attacks. Article:","completion":"Title: Cameroon Imposes Ban on Full-Face Islamic Veils in Far North Region Following Suicide Bomb Attacks Introduction Cameroon has recently placed a ban on the wearing of full-face Islamic veils, including the burka, in the Far North region of the country, following a series of suicide bomb attacks. The move is an attempt to improve security measures and prevent a repeat of the tragic events that claimed numerous lives. However, the decision has stirred some debate, given that the ban is targeting a highly significant religious garment for Muslim women. Background The Far North region of Cameroon has been under heightened security for quite some time, primarily due to the ongoing threat posed by Boko Haram, a jihadist extremist group based in northeastern Nigeria. The group has carried out numerous violent assaults in Nigeria and neighboring countries such as Cameroon, Niger, and Chad, with the declared aim of establishing an Islamic state in the region. Recent Suicide Bomb Attacks On July 12, 2022, two deadly suicide bomb attacks were carried out in the town of Fotokol, in the Far North region of Cameroon. These attacks left at least 13 people dead and several others injured. It is worth noting that the female attackers were reportedly wearing full-face Islamic veils, which helped them conceal their deadly intentions. The Ban on Full-Face Islamic Veils In response to the attacks, the authorities in Cameroon have announced a ban on the wearing of full-face Islamic veils in the Far North region in order to improve security measures. The decision aims to make it more difficult for potential terrorists to blend in with local communities and execute attacks using explosives hidden underneath religious garments. The ban is expected to be strictly enforced, with law enforcement officers instructed to detain and thoroughly search those found wearing full-face veils. The Debate Surrounding the Ban While the concerns for public safety are legitimate, some human rights organizations have criticized the decision as discriminatory against Muslims. The Islamic veil is a significant symbol of modesty and religious identity for Muslim women, and the ban may result in the ostracization or marginalization of those who choose to uphold their religious convictions. Moreover, some experts argue that such a ban might not prove to be an effective measure in preventing terrorist attacks, as attackers could adopt alternative methods to conceal their plans. Conclusion The ban on full-face Islamic veils in the Far North region of Cameroon is a controversial move that seeks to address safety concerns while raising questions about religious freedom and discriminatory practices. As the country continues to deal with the ongoing threat of extremist violence, it remains to be seen whether this measure will achieve its intended purpose of preventing future attacks, or if it will merely exacerbate tensions between different religious and cultural groups. It is crucial for the authorities to find a balance between safeguarding public security and respecting the rights of individuals to freely express their religious beliefs without fear of discrimination or persecution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hong Kong Paper Outlines Charges Against Ai Weiwei SHANGHAI — Ai Weiwei, the prominent Chinese artist and social critic who was detained by the police this month, is being investigated for tax evasion, destroying evidence and distributing pornography, according to a Hong Kong-based newspaper with close ties to Beijing.

In an interview with The Associated Press, she said his financial affairs were controlled by a company registered to her, so any tax issues would be her responsibility, not his.

Background: Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as the lead guitarist and as a vocalist with the band Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965-1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). Context: Jerry Garcia's ancestors on his father's side were from Galicia in northwest Spain. His mother's ancestors were Irish and Swedish. He was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California, on August 1, 1942, to Jose Ramon \\"Joe\\" Garcia and Ruth Marie \\"Bobbie\\" (nee Clifford) Garcia, who was herself born in San Francisco. His parents named him after composer Jerome Kern. Jerome John was their second child, preceded by Clifford Ramon \\"Tiff\\", who was born in 1937. Shortly before Clifford's birth, their father and a partner leased a building in downtown San Francisco and turned it into a bar, partly in response to Jose being blackballed from a musicians' union for moonlighting. Garcia was influenced by music at an early age, taking piano lessons for much of his childhood. His father was a retired professional musician and his mother enjoyed playing the piano. His father's extended family--who had emigrated from Spain in 1919--would often sing during reunions. Garcia experienced several tragedies during his youth. At age four, while the family was vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains, two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood. Jerry steadied a piece of wood with his finger, but Tiff miscalculated and the axe severed most of Jerry's middle finger. After his mother wrapped his hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30 miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia -- who had not looked at his finger since the accident -- was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood. Less than a year after he lost most of his finger, his father died. Vacationing with his family near Arcata in Northern California in 1947, Garcia's father went fly fishing in the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest. Not long after entering the river, Garcia's father slipped on a rock, lost his balance and was swept away by the river's rapids. He drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw his father fall into the river, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, lends weight to McNally's claim. Jackson's evidence was that a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Garcia was present when he died. Question: Was he happy as a kid?. Whats the answer?","completion":"While it is not possible to definitively quantify happiness, it can be inferred that Jerry Garcia faced several challenges and tragedies during his childhood that could have potentially impacted his overall happiness. However, he showed resilience and found solace in music which played an integral role throughout his life. Some of the key events that could have affected his happiness as a child include: 1. The loss of two-thirds of his right middle finger in an accident. 2. The tragic death of his father, which Garcia claimed to have witnessed. These experiences may have shaped Garcia as an individual and might have influenced his perception of life and happiness later on. Despite these challenges, it is important to note that Garcia's love for music was nurtured from an early age, due to both of his parents having a musical background. His father's family often sang during reunions, and his mother played the piano, providing him with a musical environment in which to grow up. As a child, Garcia took piano lessons and later developed a passion for the guitar, which shaped his career as the lead guitarist and vocalist for the Grateful Dead. Garcia's interest in music allowed him to develop a skill set and to find a way of expressing himself, which could have brought him happiness and a sense of purpose despite the hardships he faced during his childhood. In conclusion, while it is difficult to determine the extent of happiness Jerry Garcia experienced as a child, it is evident that he faced significant difficulties during his early years. Nonetheless, his love for music and natural talent may have provided him with a source of happiness and resilience amidst his challenging circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Questions 1 and 2 seem to be asking similar things, but they are not identical due to the presence of a picture in Question 2. Let me break it down for you: Question 1: What does this Chinese word mean? This question is asking for the meaning of a specific Chinese word. However, the actual word is not provided in the question itself, and the question remains ambiguous without further contextual information. A more clear version of this question would be to provide the Chinese word or its pronunciation, for example, \\"What does the Chinese word '永远' mean?\\" which would have a direct answer: it means \\"forever.\\" Question 2: What does this Chinese word mean on the picture? This question is slightly different from the first one due to the inclusion of \\"on the picture.\\" The question implies that there is a picture provided, and the Chinese word in question is depicted in the image. The person asking the question might be interested in understanding the meaning of a word that appears in an image, art piece, or even traditional calligraphy. The meaning of the word may be influenced by the visual context of the picture. To sum up, while both questions are related to the meaning of a specific Chinese word, the second question also includes the context of an image which could potentially alter or affect the meaning of the word. They are not the same question exactly, but they do share similarities in their general intent of asking about the Chinese language.

Disappearance is set in the Mojave desert as Jim (Harry Hamlin) & Patty Henley (Susan Dey) plus their two kids Katie (Basia A'Hern) & Matt (Jeremey Lelliott) along with Ethan (Jamie Croft) a friend of the family are travelling along, they stop at a roadside diner & ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called Weaver. No-one claims to have heard of it but it's definitely there & the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out & take some pictures. Once at the town they take some pictures & have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won't start & they have to spend the night there. While looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared, the next morning & their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn. What is Weaver's secret? Will the Henley's ever leave there alive... Written, co-executive produced & directed by Walter Klenhard I have to say that Disappearance is one of the most frustrating films I have ever watched. For the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller & horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history. The script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms & I was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on, from the families car mysterious disappearing, the four recent graves, the thing in the abandoned mines, the supernatural sandstorm, the sudden & unexplained disappearance of Ethan & his just as unexplained reappearance, the Sheriff's sinister motives, the compass in the car going crazy, the crashed plane, the townspeople denying Weaver existed & the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near Weaver in the 40's but they are all tossed out of the window & for all we know could have been totally separate random events. Everything was coming along nicely & was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming & instead I was treated to the most ambiguous, strange, surreal & downright frustrating ending possible. If nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before & leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. It's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn't know what to do with them & just made the ending up on the spot. I just felt I put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward & in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute! Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere & the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation. It's well made but what were they thinking with that ending? Nothing fits, nothing makes sense & it's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour & a half leaves you confused & wanting to know more. Despite being a horror film there's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here & there. The film actually reminds of The Hills Have Eyes (2006) remake for large parts as that is what the film is set-up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film. Technically the film is good with high production values, good special effects, sets, locations & cinematography. Set in America but filmed in South Australia. The acting is fine from a decent cast. Disappearance is a really odd film, for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens & the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers.

On the other hand, a \\"London sweater\\" is an inaccurate term, as sweaters are pieces of clothing and do not hold any position or role.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Plot title: Inspector Gadget Movie plot: John Brown is a security guard working at the Bradford robotics laboratory in Riverton, Ohio, run by Artemus Bradford and his daughter Brenda, whom Brown is attracted to. Brown wishes to become a police officer, with support from his niece Penny. Brenda and Artemus create a lifelike robotic foot as part of the Gadget Program, to create cybernetically augmented police officers. Tycoon Sanford Scolex attacks the lab, steals the foot, and has Artemus murdered before escaping in his limo. Brown chases him down in his car, which leads to it being destroyed by Scolex's explosive cigar, leaving Brown for dead, but a bowling ball coming from the fiery blast of Brown's destroyed car crushes Scolex's hand, forcing him to replace it with a mechanical claw. Brown survives the explosion, but is seriously injured. He becomes the first test subject for the Gadget Program, as a cyborg with countless gadgets he can activate by saying \\"Go, Go, Gadget\\". Under Brenda's guidance, Brown becomes Inspector Gadget. Scolex creates the alias \\"Claw\\" and uses the stolen technology to create his own robot for global domination, aided by his minions Kramer and Sykes, but the attempts fail. Much to the irritation of Chief Quimby, Gadget joins the police department, aided by his talking advanced car, the Gadgetmobile. However, Quimby refuses to give Gadget the Bradford case and instead assigns him to mediocre jobs, prompting Gadget to secretly investigate the case himself. Examining the evidence, he finds a connection to Scolexâs company, which Brenda has now gone to work for. Breaking into Scolex's lab, he locates the foot but is taken captive by Scolex, who discovers Gadget is powered by a processor chip, which Scolex removes, and has Sykes dump Gadget in a junkyard.

This will help you see if you have accurately filled the cup.

In option (i), the method to look at the measuring line from the top may lead to inaccurate measurements.

You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger. But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine. When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential worst cases, too. For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room. At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important. Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25. Near the end of his life Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party, was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile. Rather, he believed, it was something that the human spirit had accomplished, and that no undertaking carried through to conclusion was for nothing.

Summarize: David Daniel Doran, 42, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to making Darrell Simester perform forced or compulsory labour. The discovery of Mr Simester, who was forced to work for 13 years, sparked a wider inquiry around Cardiff. Police said they are trying to find the other men they are concerned about. Officers have received worrying information about one man in particular who they are now trying to locate. It comes after Cardiff Crown Court heard how Mr Simester, 44, a timid man who was easily led, was kept in squalid and dirty conditions at Cariad Farm in Peterstone near Newport. He was living in a cold caravan, washing in a horse trough and working up to 16 hours a day all year round. Sentencing Doran on Friday, Judge Neil Bidder QC said the way he treated the victim was \\"repellent and wrong\\" and \\"not much better than a slave\\". What happened to Mr Simester, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, led to a wider police investigation. Acting on intelligence, police launched an operation at Cariad Farm and began digging for possible human remains in September 2013. Their information proved to be wrong and they found nothing. But police said there were other leads too and some have already led to the rescue of vulnerable adults. In other cases the information has been too sketchy and detectives said they do not have enough to go on. They have told BBC Wales that they are increasingly concerned for one man in particular. Det Supt Paul Griffiths, of Gwent Police, who is heading the investigation, said: \\"We've got a lot of individual names, nicknames or descriptions and we've been trying to locate them on the basis of the information we have and we've been very successful in identifying a large number of individuals, but equally sometimes information is not substantial enough to locate individuals.\\" They cannot release the name of the man - they themselves only have a nickname - but they say they are worried for his welfare and following all potential leads to try to find him. Mr Simester had gone missing after going on a trip to the seaside in Porthcawl, south Wales, in 2000. As he headed home he was picked up at the side of a dual carriageway by a member of the Doran family and taken to Cariad Farm. He was only found after his family launched a social media campaign and they received a tip-off from a member of the public. When they saw him again they could hardly recognise him and described him as being a \\"broken man\\" who looked far older than his years. Health-wise he was in a \\"horrific state\\" with a chest infection, a hernia and calloused feet, along with being very malnourished. David Daniel Doran pleaded guilty midway through his trial to making Mr Simester perform forced or compulsory labour. His father Daniel Doran, 67, who faced the same charge, was formally found not guilty earlier this month.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Without proper context, it is difficult to relate this premise directly to the hypothesis, which makes a specific claim regarding immortality and water. The hypothesis states that \\"We don't need water anymore, we're immortal.\\" Immortality refers to the ability to live indefinitely, without aging or experiencing death. Although it is a concept that has fascinated humans throughout history, it has not been proven or achieved scientifically. Furthermore, it is unclear how the hypothesis connects to the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about immortality or the potential effects of immortality on human needs. Moreover, even if we were to somehow achieve immortality, it does not necessarily mean we would no longer require water for survival. Water is essential for our bodily functions such as regulating body temperature, providing essential nutrients, aiding digestion, and flushing out toxins among others. Immortality may imply that we would not die due to aging or other natural causes, but it does not necessarily imply that our fundamental biological needs would change.

Affirmed (February 21, 1975 - January 12, 2001) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the eleventh winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade Affirmed returned to racing in early August in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. He nearly became an upset loser to the front-running Sensitive Prince but closed in the last 100 yards in a race that Laz Barrera considered one of Affirmed's finest efforts. Alydar and Affirmed met once more, in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Affirmed, piloted by Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay substituting for the injured Cauthen, cut off Alydar entering the far turn, causing his rival to hit the rail and almost go down, losing six lengths before recovering his stride. Affirmed finished first but was disqualified and placed second. The horses never met again, and the final winning tally stood at Affirmed 7, Alydar 3. Affirmed then prepared to meet another major rival: 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. The 1978 Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap marked the first time in racing history that two Triple Crown winners ever met in a race. Seattle Slew was a speed horse and got the first quarter mile in 24 seconds under jockey Angel Cordero, who never allowed Affirmed to get close. Seattle Slew won by three lengths in 1:45 4/5 for the one-turn mile and 1/8. The two horses met once more, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. This time, Affirmed was to be aided by his stablemate Life's Hope, who was entered in the race to extend Seattle Slew in the early stages. However, Affirmed's saddle slipped during the race, leaving his jockey with almost no control. He tired to finish unplaced for the only time in his career as Exceller and jockey Willie Shoemaker defeated Seattle Slew by a nose. As a three-year-old, Affirmed won 8 of 11 starts with 2 seconds and 1 unplaced run, for earnings of 901,541. He was named Horse of the Year despite the losses to Alydar, Seattle Slew, and Exceller, and was also named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

Some of the key races Affirmed won as a four-year-old include: 1. Strub Stakes: Affirmed won the Strub Stakes at Santa Anita Park, beating his rivals and showcasing his talent once more. 2. Santa Anita Handicap: Affirmed went on to win the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap, a race considered to be one of the most important for older horses in the United States. 3. Hollywood Gold Cup: Another significant victory for Affirmed was in the Hollywood Gold Cup at Hollywood Park, where he defeated his competition and continued to build his winning reputation. 4. Woodward Stakes: Affirmed won the highly-regarded Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, solidifying his position as one of the greatest racehorses of all time. During his four-year-old season, Affirmed won 7 of his 9 starts and secured his second consecutive Horse of the Year title. Accolades also included being named the American Champion Older Male Horse.

Some features of the current global economic upswing have contributed to the emergence of a number of risks that developing countries will have to face. The global economy has been riding a wave of an upswing. However, the potential deterioration of this climate is a situation that may prove to be a significant challenge, especially for developing nations. There are several reasons why this is the case. Firstly, the economies of developing countries tend to be more vulnerable during economic downturns. This is because the financial systems in these countries are usually less robust, yielding more susceptibility to external shocks. These countries often depend heavily on foreign direct investment or aid, both of which can dry up during a global economic downturn. Secondly, these countries often lack the fiscal space to counteract the effects of a downturn. They usually don't have enough resources to stimulate their economies through government spending or tax cuts when necessary. This means they can suffer more and take longer to recover from a global economic downturn. Additionally, high levels of public debt, common in developing countries, can limit their ability to take counter-cyclical actions during downturns. Thirdly, developing countries are often reliant on the export of a narrow range of goods, frequently raw materials. If the global economy slows significantly, demand for these goods may drop, leading to a decrease in export revenues, a key income stream for many developing nations. Finally, a global economic downturn may weaken the currencies of developing countries, making it more expensive for them to repay debts denominated in foreign currencies. This situation, known as a currency crisis, can aggravate economic problems and lead to severe recessions. In conclusion, the potential deterioration of the global economic climate would represent a stress test for many developing nations. The emergence of these new risks is a result of the specific characteristics of the current global economic upswing. To overcome such challenges, developing countries will need to strengthen their economic structures, diversify their economies, and manage their debts more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

After you have removed as much excess caulk as you can, wet a piece of folded paper towel with some rubbing alcohol. Blot the stain, firmly, and let the alcohol soak deep into the fabric. Dab the stain as many times as needed to remove the stain. You may need to reapply several times to remove the stain. Add more alcohol each time. Always use a clean section of the towel. If the towel becomes overly stained and saturated with caulk, you may need to switch to another rag. Once the stain is removed, launder the garment in cold or warm water. When you remove the garment from the washer, examine the stain to make sure it's completely removed. You may have to wash it a few times to get the stain completely out. Don't place it in a dryer with any stain remaining, since the heat will set it.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

Given the below context: De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals.

Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the product review can be considered negative. The reviewer provides a number of reasons for this unfavorable assessment, which contribute to forming a comprehensive understanding of their perspective on the book. First, the reviewer acknowledges that the story takes place in a historical context, specifically World War II-era Washington DC. This setting is intriguing to them, which is a positive aspect. However, they go on to criticize the \\"dated\\" feel of the book, implying that the way the story is written or the themes within it comes across as antiquated or out of touch with modern sensibilities. This outdated atmosphere detracts from the reader's overall enjoyment of the book. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly states that they do not plan to read any more works from the author. This declaration implies dissatisfaction with the writing style or the choice of subject matter, making it clear the reviewer does not see value in exploring additional titles by the same writer. Lastly, the reviewer comments on the book's cover, labeling it as the \\"ugliest cover of the year.\\" The aesthetics of a book's cover can contribute to a reader's decision to pick it up or pass it over, and poor design can reflect negatively on the product's overall appeal. In this case, the reviewer's derogatory remark about the cover adds another layer to their general dissatisfaction.

His distant relatives included the 19th Century Swiss painter Eugène Burnand and Sir Francis Burnand, editor of Punch magazine from 1880-1906. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Geoffrey Burnand was born during the year of the rat.","completion":"To determine if Geoffrey Burnand was born during the year of the rat, we need to examine the Chinese zodiac cycle. The Chinese zodiac is a repeating cycle composed of 12 years, with each year associated with an animal sign. The 12 animals, in order, are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Geoffrey Burnand was born on January 1, 1912. To find out if 1912 falls under the year of the rat, we can analyze the Chinese zodiac calendar. The year 1900 was the year of the rat, so we can use that as a reference point to identify the animal signs during the subsequent years. Here's a breakdown of the animal signs for the years around 1912: 1. 1900 - Rat 2. 1901 - Ox 3. 1902 - Tiger 4. 1903 - Rabbit 5. 1904 - Dragon 6. 1905 - Snake 7. 1906 - Horse 8. 1907 - Goat 9. 1908 - Monkey 10. 1909 - Rooster 11. 1910 - Dog 12. 1911 - Pig Since the cycle restarts after the 12th animal (Pig), the next year (1912) would be associated with the first animal in the cycle, which is the Rat. Accordingly, the statement \\"Geoffrey Burnand was born during the year of the rat\\" is true, as he was born on January 1, 1912, which falls under the year of the Rat in the Chinese zodiac."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power. - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world. - In the geologic timescale, the Capitanian is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the uppermost or latest of three subdivisions of the Guadalupian epoch or series. The Capitanian lasted between and . It was preceded by the Wordian and followed by the Wuchiapingian. - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\". - In the geologic timescale, the Wuchiapingian or Wujiapingian (from in the Liangshan area of Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province) is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the lower or earlier of two subdivisions of the Lopingian epoch or series. The Wuchiapingian spans the time between and million years ago (Ma). It was preceded by the Capitanian and followed by the Changhsingian. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. - Keratocephalus ( \`\` horned head '' ) is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsid from the early Capitanian age of South Africa . It was found in the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Karoo deposits , in the Lower Beaufort Beds in Beaufort West . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade.

Title: only one decent song Review: My interest was peaked after reading about the tragic end of Ms. McCorkle in the local newspaper and her ties to our area--Berkeley. After ordering two of her recommended albums, I had to literally force myself to listen several times to her albums, \\"The People That You Never Get To Love\\" and \\"Thanks For The Memory\\". I have to be honest and admit I'm quite stymied as to why anyone would endorse buying her CDs. Yes, Ms. McCorkle can sing. Many people can sing but that doesn't mean they should be selling CDs. Maybe seeing her in a small caberet would be more appropriate. The only \\"jazz\\" I hear is in the fine instrumentals, not in her voice which seems to lack depth or versatility. At times her clear and succinct diction is very painful to listen to. \\"No More Blues\\" is the only decent song on this album; \\"Foodaphobia\\" sounds so strained and out of tune, it's difficult to endure.

Input: Doctors say Joan Smith, 71, is one of the first patients outside of clinical trials to be fitted with the revolutionary device. The former council receptionist had the operation at Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital in February. She had gone through two previously unsuccessful attempts to have a conventional pacemaker fitted. Mrs Smith, who was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy 21 years ago, said: \\"I feel as if I'm a new woman.\\" \\"I didn't feel any fatigue at all and it had been fatigue that I had been feeling previously - not breathlessness like some people experience. Doctors stabilised her with medication for 20 years, but last year she was told she needed a pacemaker. She was fitted with a new type called a WiSE pacemaker, which is implanted directly into tissue that lines the left chamber of the heart. Like a conventional unit, it controls abnormal heart rhythms using low-energy electrical pulses - but without the need for wires. Simon James, consultant cardiologist, said: \\"For Joan, as soon as the device was switched on there was a huge change in the pumping of the heart. \\"Her blood pressure went up from the moment it was switched on so we felt confident she would begin to feel better quickly. \\"The technology enables us to fit the device exactly where an individual patient needs it, which could increase the number of patients who respond to this therapy, helping them to live a longer, more active life.\\" A spokesman for South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said James Cook was one of the first hospitals to take advantage of the new type of treatment outside of a research study.

On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb and rushed through a grassy expanse before plunging down an embankment toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911. Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window. \\"I have a fear of water,\\" Kenny said now. \\"I almost drowned when I was nine.\\" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. \\"I couldn't just leave her,\\" he adds. The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt. \\"Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,\\" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl. That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. \\"I flipped into rescue mode,\\" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out. Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock. \\"Give her CPR!\\" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. \\"Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,\\" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, \\"Pump her chest!\\" \\"We tried three times,\\" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water. Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat. Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. \\"We couldn't believe she was all right,\\" said Pamela. \\"It's just amazing that these people came together,\\" said Cheryl.

This band of loyalists to the throne is lead by a Robin Hood-type outlaw, the Black Fox (Edward Ashley). The scene changes to the castle where King Roderick (Cecil Parker) is considering an alliance with Griswold of McElwaine in which the King would offer his daughter, Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), as Griswold's bride. Gwendolyn is completely opposed to this arrangement. Back in the forest, the audience is led to believe the Black Fox is singing \\"(You'll Never) Outfox the Fox.\\" He is assisted by a band of midgets, all in Black Fox outfits. However, soon the real Black Fox arrives and we learn that the person who was impersonating the Black Fox is Hubert Hawkins (Danny Kaye), a former carnival entertainer, and the midgets are his pals from the carnival. When the Black Fox reprimands Hawkins for wearing his clothes, he responds that he is only trying to improve the morale of the troops. Maid Jean (Glynis Johns), who is a Captain in the Black Fox's band of outlaws, enters to announce that a group of recruits is arriving. The Black Fox orders Hawkins to get the child - the royal child.

Summarize this article: Recognizing that you have the Sunday Blues and what they stem from can go a long way to helping you work through them. Keep a log of specific actions, tasks, or times of days that trigger your blues. Write down exactly what you feel, what time it is, and why you think you feel that way. After a few weeks, look for patterns in your log to see what is causing your blues. If your Sunday blues come from leaving unpleasant tasks for the week ahead until Sunday night to complete, then you can help yourself feel better by changing your weekend and work routine. If your Sunday blues stem from anxiety about an upcoming presentation or assignment due on Monday, allow yourself to acknowledge your nervousness as normal, and then tell yourself that Monday will go well. Set aside prep time that weekend to make sure you are prepared. If your Sunday blues stem from your job, and none of the steps you take to address them work, then it may be time to look for new employment. Schedule a little time on Sunday's to update your resume and search for work. Taking positive steps forward will help you cope with returning to your job the next day. If you think of Friday as the end of the week, you'll be anxious about what you haven't gotten done. Similarly, if you think of Sunday as the end of the weekend, you'll worry that you haven't maximized your time. But these days aren't ends. They are a part of an unending procession of days and nights, each one a part of a larger process. If you don't finish what you hoped to on Sunday, that's fine. You have the next week to do it. So instead of creating artificial units of time, separate from the rest of life, during which certain tasks have to be accomplished, try to weave those tasks into the overall fabric of your life. If Sunday evening is approaching and you still have tasks to accomplish, don't try to cram them in that night. Instead, make a to-do list of how you will accomplish them during the week to come. Space out fun activities. Trying to cram all your fun into the weekend can be more stressful than enjoyable. Be sure to space out fun activities over the course of the week. That way you won't be disappointed if your weekend isn't as fantastic as you hoped. If after adjusting your weekend routine, organizing your Fridays, and trying to make Monday a fun day, you still suffer from the Sunday Night Blues, it is time to get professional guidance to help you explore the deeper causes of your negative feelings. They might stem from experiences earlier in your life, such as fearing school on Mondays because you were bullied or had a learning disorder. Or they might reflect unease with the type of work you do. A professional counselor can help you talk through and, hopefully, resolve your negative feelings.","completion":"To work through the Sunday Blues, recognize their cause by keeping a log of specific actions, tasks, or times that trigger the blues.

Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Now, I have a new situation: The department of geriatrics conducted a study on two groups of people, group V composed of people above 65 years old, and group W which had people under 65 and many under 60 years old. They were studying the effects on aging on the human body. Answer this question please: Which group had more people with risk of pneumonia? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, group V, composed of people above 65 years old, would have more people with the risk of pneumonia. This is because the immune system becomes less efficient during old age, which increases the susceptibility to serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Since group V consists of individuals who fall within the old age category (above 65 years old), they are more likely to experience a decline in immune system efficiency and, therefore, have a higher risk of pneumonia compared to group W, which primarily consists of people under the age of 65."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve this math problem Solve 2 = 9*z - 25 for z.","completion":"The given equation is 2 = 9*z - 25 and you are asked to solve it for z. Here are the steps to solving it: Step 1: Firstly, it's best to isolate the term with z (which is 9*z) on one side of the equation by moving the constant term (-25 in this case) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 25 to both sides of the equation. The equation becomes: 2 + 25 = 9*z - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 27 = 9*z Step 2: Next, you want to solve for z. To do that, you need to get rid of the 9 that is currently being multiplied by the z. You can do this by doing the opposite operation - in this case, that's division. Divide both sides of the equation by 9: 27 / 9 = (9*z) / 9 This simplifies to: 3 = z So, the solution to the equation 2 = 9*z - 25 for z is z = 3. This means that if you substitute 3 back into the equation in place of z, the left-hand side should equal the right-hand side, thereby satisfying the equation."},{"prompt":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: High school sophomore Samantha \\"Sam\\" Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day on her 16th birthday, which her entire family has forgotten about because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON – The Obama administration’s overhauled healthcare website got off to a bumpy relaunch Monday as a rush of consumers caused an uptick in errors and forced the administration to put thousands of shoppers on the HealthCare.gov site on hold. “Demand today has been high,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is operating the troubled portal for the president’s healthcare law. “We do know that things are not perfect with the site.” Bataille said about 375,000 visitors went to the site before noon, about double the normal traffic for a Monday morning. The volume caused pages to load slowly and the rate of errors to spike. About 10 a.m. EST, federal officials turned on a new queuing system that alerts some visitors to the site to come back later. PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare The new problems came just a day after the administration announced that it had hit its goal of rescuing HealthCare.gov from its disastrous launch two months ago. Officials said over the weekend that improvements to the site would allow 50,000 people to use it simultaneously. But Bataille acknowledged that her agency was forced to start queuing visitors when about 35,000 visitors were on the site Monday morning. “We will continue to work to make improvements and upgrades,” she said. [Updated, 6:48 p.m. Dec. 2: The administration said performance of the site improved later in the day, saying in a Twitter message that 750,000 people had used the site by 5:30 p.m. and that users were no longer having to wait in the queue.] The website is supposed to allow consumers in 36 states who do not get health coverage through work to shop for a health plan. The plans must meet new standards outlined in the Affordable Care Act. The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia are using their own insurance marketplaces and websites for residents. In most cases, those have functioned significantly better than HealthCare.gov. Other issues with the site continue to concern insurance companies, which have been getting inaccurate or incomplete data about consumers who have tried to enroll in health plans through HealthCare.gov. PHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments Bataille said Monday that officials believe they have fixed one of the main software bugs responsible for errors in the transmission of this data. But she refused to provide information about the extent of the problem and what percentage of consumer data is now is being accurately sent, a critical measure of the site’s effectiveness. Bataille urged consumers who believe they have successfully enrolled in a health plan through the website to double check with their insurance carriers.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Ihab Issa lost track of how often he has tried to buy insurance through HealthCare.gov, although he knows it is probably more than 100 times. Issa, 48, who works in a psycho­therapy office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., started logging in to the Web site when it launched Oct. 1. Since then, he has visited the site once or twice a day, only to encounter a different obstacle. But on Sunday — after 61 days of trying — the system worked. “I was thrilled,” Issa said. “I had to be at work, but I just wanted to sit there and look at all the different options.” The White House announced early Sunday that, given the recent improvements in the site, most HealthCare.gov shoppers should be able to have an experience like Issa’s. By 10 a.m., however, the Web site seemed to be struggling with high traffic. Federal health officials said they saw an increase in error rates and a slowdown in response times and decided to deploy “queueing” software designed to limit the number of users permitted on the site at one time. The number of users at that point had reached the “mid-30,000” range, said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing HealthCare.gov. That figure is substantially below the 50,000 simultaneous users that officials said the site would be able to handle as of Sunday. Asked whether Monday’s traffic indicated that the site’s true capacity was below 50,000, Bataille did not answer directly. She referred instead to a separate metric the administration has used to measure success — that 800,000 people would be able to use the Web site in the course of a single day. From midnight to noon Monday, HealthCare.gov had 375,000 visitors, and Bataille said the site was on pace to exceed the 800,000 figure by the end of the day. At 5:30 p.m., the Web site reported 750,000 visitors; shoppers no longer had to wait in line and error rates were low, according to a HealthCare.gov tweet. With twice as much traffic as the site sees on a typical Monday, error rates and page wait times were higher than normal, Bataille said. The average page took two seconds to load, four times the administration’s target of half a second or less. Web pages had an error rate of 0.9 percent; the target error rate is 1 percent or lower. Those who had to wait earlier in the day received a message saying the wait was necessary “so we can make sure there’s room for you to have a good experience on our site.” Shoppers had the option to leave their e-mail addresses and be notified when the site was available. When they returned, they were supposed to be moved to the front of the queue. Kathy Coombs, 61, of Alexandria was able to log on to the site Oct. 1. She created an account and received an e-mail saying her results had been processed. “I was so excited about it,” said Coombs, who is likely to receive a government subsidy to help her pay for her insurance. “I’m a huge liberal and big proponent of all this, and as a recent widow I could really benefit.” But since then, she has been unable to see her choices of health plans. At 1:30 p.m. Monday, she tried again, but she ran into heavy traffic and was unable to proceed. “I still hit a dead end,” she said. Others had more success shopping for insurance over the weekend, when traffic was lighter. Tom Marchetti, a 41-year-old pizzeria owner from Freeland, Pa., enrolled in coverage Sunday after weeks of failed attempts. When he logged on Sunday, he noticed a new button that allowed him to delete his pending application. He breezed through a new application in less than an hour, purchasing a policy that he said is comparable in price and coverage to the plan he has in the individual market. Still, Marchetti is not totally sure he is in the clear. While the Web site listed his maximum annual out-of-pocket costs as 175, the insurance company says that the number is 3,500. It is possible that Marchetti may qualify for subsidy to reduce those costs, but he needs to reach his new insurance provider to figure out the discrepancy. Others, though, were just as stuck Monday as they were in the past. One persistent issue appears to involve identity verification, in which HealthCare.gov tries to make sure people are who they say they are. Kelly Weaver, a substitute teacher in Michigan, said her application has been stuck in the identity verification process since mid-October. “I don’t know what they’re fixing,” Weaver said Monday. She said she considers herself a health-law supporter. She tried logging in on Sunday, but her identity had not been verified. Weaver has submitted identity verification information online and over the phone. She has uploaded copies of her driver’s license to the Web site. When she has called the customer service center, she has twice been told that she would receive a call back in two to five business days. She never did. “When I talk to them on the phone, they say, ‘We’ll have to get back to you,’ ” Weaver said. “But it’s really, ‘We’re getting you off the phone because other people are waiting in the queue.’ ” One person who is likely to zoom through enrollment: President Obama. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama planned to buy coverage through the exchange, even though he was not required to by law. Carney did not say when the registration will happen. The president has the option of choosing to enroll through the District of Columbia’s exchange or the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, which is handling sign-ups for his home state of Illinois. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE The federal government may say it has improved HealthCare.gov but insurers say they are not so sure. And customers signing up for health insurance need to make sure they really are covered. The key? Look for the orange pop-up notice. Lots of people may be in that position. A senior administration official told NBC News that 750,000 people had visited the site as of 5.30 p.m. Eastern time Monday. Visits don't equal enrollments, but it's a far higher number of visitors than the site's been forced to handle since the first few days of its disastrous launch. The so-called back end — where the actual business of paying for and getting enrolled in insurance takes place, isn’t working perfectly. Officials say they’re aware of it, and reminding people to make sure they are, in fact, fully enrolled. “When a consumer selects a plan and enrolls in marketplace coverage, an orange message is clearly displayed letting them know that they must make payment to be covered,” said a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is running the website. “If a consumer doesn’t receive that notice or is unsure as to whether they successfully enrolled, they should contact our call center or the insurer of their choice. The consumer will then be contacted by their insurer on how and when to make payment.” CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said the agency will try to confirm that those who have enrolled know their next steps to ensure they are covered. Robert Zirkelbach of America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, says forms called “834s” are still glitchy. They are a kind of digital enrollment form that conveys crucial information about new customers to the insurance company. “Health insurers are still seeing enrollments that are duplicated, missing information, things like that,\\" Zirkelbach said. CMS officials say they’re working on it. \\"We have fixed many of the bugs that led to the 834 issues,\\" Bataille said Tuesday. She said a single bug involving social security numbers caused 80 percent of the problems, and had been fixed. This past weekend was the government’s self-imposed deadline for fixing the faulty HealthCare.gov website. Jeff Zients, the incoming White House economic adviser named by President Barack Obama to lead repair efforts, gave his team’s efforts a glowing review on Sunday. “After clearing through fewer than 100 bugs across the entire month of October, the speed has more than tripled, with over 400 bugs fixed,” Zients told reporters in a telephone briefing. He said HealthCare.gov was now working more than 90 percent of the time and up to the promised capacity of 50,000 users at any given time. Bataille said traffic slowed the site down Monday morning, with error rates going up and response time going down. When about 30,000 users were on the site at one time Monday morning, the technology team deployed a new queuing system that tells users the site is too busy and offering to send them an email when traffic eases, Bataille said. That's fewer users than the promised 50,000 at once but Bataille declined to say so directly. Separately, a person familiar with the numbers who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss them said an estimated 100,000 people had been able to choose a health plan using the federally run site in November. That compares to around 27,000 in October, and far fewer than what officials had hoped for. New York reported on Monday that 91,103 New Yorkers have managed to fully enroll on that state's site. \\"Of these enrollees, 50,119 have enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan and 40,984 have qualified for Medicaid,\\" the state health department said in a statement. The White House will officially report the November enrollments in mid-December. Officials say the numbers must be “scrubbed” to make sure they are accurate. In the meantime, the best way to tell how things are going will be in anecdotes, says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “We will see if people are being helped,” he said. It was the litany of first-person stories that fueled the heavy news media coverage about people losing their private plans, Levitt said. On top of having their plans canceled, their best hope for finding alternative care was the balky website. “It was so hard for people to find out what their options are,” he said. Obama relented and said the federal government would allow private insurers to continue issuing plans in 2014 even if they didn’t meet the new, strict requirements for coverage — although it’s been left to the states to decide whether they really can. The White House and CMS were preparing, and hoping, for a rush of enrollees in December. Experts say experience shows that Americans tend to wait until the last minute to sign up for health insurance. Plus, the Obama administration slid the open enrollment period back a little, giving people until Dec. 23 to sign up for coverage that would start on the first day possible, Jan. 1. People have until March 31 to sign up for coverage and get credit for being covered in 2014. Anyone going without medical insurance in 2014 may have to pay a tax. More than 40 million Americans lack health insurance and one of the primary goals of the 2010 Affordable Care Act was to get them covered — either by buying tightly regulated, private insurance on the exchanges, or by getting expanded Medicaid in the states that choose to expand it, or through an employer under new requirements for covering workers. CMS officials say the website’s repair is an ongoing process. Zients leaves for his job at the White House in January and White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said he will be replaced, but didn’t say whether there is a candidate. · Follow NBCNewsHealth on Facebook and on Twitter · Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter ||||| Wait, what?

We look at some websites that outperformed it over Black Friday weekend. (The Washington Post) HealthCare.gov was available for 95.1% of users in the week ending November 30. We look at some websites that outperformed it over Black Friday weekend. (The Washington Post) The enrollment records for a significant portion of the Americans who have chosen health plans through the online federal insurance marketplace contain errors — generated by the computer system — that mean they might not get the coverage they’re expecting next month. The errors cumulatively have affected roughly one-third of the people who have signed up for health plans since Oct. 1, according to two government and health-care industry officials. The White House disputed the figure but declined to provide its own. The mistakes include failure to notify insurers about new customers, duplicate enrollments or cancellation notices for the same person, incorrect information about family members, and mistakes involving federal subsidies. The errors have been accumulating since HealthCare.gov opened two months ago, even as the Obama administration has been working to make it easier for consumers to sign up for coverage, the government and industry officials said. Figuring out how to clean up the backlog of errors and prevent similar ones in the future is emerging as the new imperative if the federal insurance exchange is to work as intended. The problems were the subject of a meeting Monday between administration officials and a new “Payer Exchange Performance Team” made up of insurance industry leaders. The idea that one-third of the enrollment records are flawed “doesn’t accurately reflect the picture of what’s happening right now,” White House senior communications adviser Tara Mc­Guinness said. “We’ve got a team of experts already working closely with issuers to make sure that every past and future 834 is accurate. We’re confident they’ll succeed,” Mc­Guin­ness said. The 834s are nightly enrollment forms sent to insurers to tell them who their new customers are. Some of the errors in the past forms were generated by the way people were using the system, another senior official on the project said, such as clicking twice on the confirmation button or moving backward and forward on the site. Through more than a dozen bug fixes over the past week, the team has managed to reduce the instances of when data was not generated on 834 forms from 3 percent last week to 0.5 percent now, according to senior officials. The heightened attention to enrollment errors follows a five-week technical blitz to improve consumers’ ability to use the site. Federal health officials announced Sunday that they had met that goal. By 6 p.m. Monday, the Web site had had close to 800,000 unique visitors — one of the administration’s targets for the site’s performance — and was set to pass that mark by the end of the day, according to administration officials. And the site processed 18,000 enrollments in the most recent 24-hour period, nearly double the previous record. Still, not all was smooth. By mid-morning Monday, some Americans trying to use the Web site were running into a logjam. And by late morning, when the number of people on the site was roughly 35,000 — or 15,000 fewer than administration officials had said it could handle — some consumers encountered a “queue,” a new feature intended for times when the site was too crowded. The feature limits the number of people on the site and notifies others by e-mail when it’s a better time to log in. According to a government official with knowledge of the federal exchange, an internal report Monday showed that nearly 149,000 individuals have completed the enrollment process through the new online system. Insurers have been fretting about the problems involving the enrollment records for weeks, both publicly and in private conversations with the White House. The figures provided to The Washington Post suggesting that a variety of errors affect at least one-third of all enrollments so far are the first public indication of the magnitude of the problem. The errors, if not corrected, mean that tens of thousands of consumers are at risk of not having coverage when the insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, because the health plans they picked do not yet have accurate information needed to send them a bill. Under the 2010 law designed to reshape the health-care system, consumers are not considered to have coverage unless they have paid at least the first monthly insurance premium. Of the various errors generated by the online system, a top priority for insurers is to correct what are called “orphan reports,” in which a new customer is inexplicably excluded from reports sent to each health plan early every evening listing their new enrollees from that day. Starting in October, five insurance carriers began to work closely with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff, periodically trading their lists of known customers. “When plans have checked this, they realize there is a good number there is no record of,” said an insurance industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the problem. Last week, the official said, the online system sent one health plan a cancellation notice for a customer for whom the plan had never received an enrollment report. The trading of enrollment records between a small number of insurers and CMS, which is overseeing the Web site, is a precursor to a monthly comparison that is scheduled to begin in mid-December. The part of the online system that is supposed to perform this comparison, known as “reconciliation,” is not yet built, according to government officials. On Monday, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for CMS, recommended that insurance seekers who choose a health plan through the site contact the insurer afterward to make certain they are actually enrolled. “Consumers should absolutely call their selected plan and confirm that they have paid their first month’s premium, and coverage will be available January 1,” she said. In a call with reporters Monday, Bataille said that about 80 percent of the errors with 834 forms — the enrollment data — stemmed from “one bug that prevented a Social Security number from being included. That caused the system not to generate an 834.” “That bug has now been fixed and [that part] is now working properly,” Bataille said. She said that CMS also has addressed smaller bugs, including one that caused family relationships to be coded inaccurately (a child, for example, might show up as a spouse). Sarah Kliff contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"In December 2013, the relaunch of the Obama administration's healthcare website, HealthCare.gov, faced a significant surge in consumer demand, causing an increase in errors and forcing the administration to put thousands of users on hold. According to Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there were about 375,000 visitors to the site before noon on the day of the relaunch, double the typical traffic for a Monday morning. This caused pages to load slowly and error rates to rise. The issues faced by the relaunched website presented difficulties for users attempting to access coverage in the 36 states where the marketplace operates. In an update, the administration reported that later in the day, the site's performance improved, with 750,000 people accessing the site by 5:30pm and users no longer having to wait in queues.

At what university did professor Lee Smolin popularize the theory of casual dynamical triangulation (CDT)? A:","completion":"To find out at which university Professor Lee Smolin popularized the theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT), I will follow four primary steps: Step 1: Identify Professor Lee Smolin's background Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has worked on various aspects of quantum gravity and cosmology. He is a prominent researcher in the field of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT). He is also a founding faculty member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Step 2: Understand Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) CDT is an approach to quantum gravity that combines elements of both LQG and simplicial quantum gravity (a discrete analogue of General Relativity). The key idea underpinning CDT is to break spacetime into discrete 'building blocks' called triangulations, which only join together in a causal and consistent way. This allows for a well-defined notion of time and causality, which can be beneficial in resolving several conceptual problems with other approaches to quantum gravity. Step 3: Examine Professor Smolin's major affiliations during the development of CDT Throughout his career, Smolin has been affiliated with various institutions, including Yale University, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. As I have noted earlier, he was a founding member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, where he has worked since its inception in 1999. It is important to determine where he was during the popularization of CDT. Step 4: Identify when and where CDT was popularized The theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulation gained popularity in the early 2000s. As Lee Smolin was a founding faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics since 1999, it is reasonable to assume that he contributed to the popularization of CDT at the Perimeter Institute.

The struggle happened early Sunday at St. Cloud Hospital in the suspect's room, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He said the suspect was not handcuffed at the time. Investigators are still trying to determine what led up to the shooting. \\"Several shots were fired during that struggle and then security officers were able to get into the room, and the suspect was tased with a Taser, and taken into custody,\\" Evans said at a news conference. \\"After he was taken into custody he became unresponsive. Medical personnel performed lifesaving operations on him and he died at that time.\\" Evans said the Aitkin County deputy killed was Steven Martin Sandberg, a 60-year-old investigator with the sheriff's office. The suspect was identified as Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, who lived near the city of Aitkin. Evans said autopsies were being performed on both of them and the medical examiner would determine more about how the suspect died. The superintendent said Hammond was subdued by two hospital security guards with the help of another Aitkin County deputy, who had just arrived to relieve Sandberg. Sandberg had been with department since 1981 and an investigator for 20 years, Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said. Evans and hospital vice president Kurt Otto declined to say why Hammond was being treated at the hospital in St. Cloud, which is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Otto said the hospital had asked the sheriff's office to send deputies to monitor Hammond because of the \\"seriousness\\" of the domestic incident, which happened sometime earlier in the week. They would not say how long Hammond had been in the hospital except that it was more than a day. He said investigators had a lot of work ahead of them, including interviewing hospital staffers who were on duty at the time. Hammond had been convicted of felony crimes including escaping from custody in 1990, third-degree burglary in 1989 and terrorist threats in 1990, according to court records. All the convictions were for crimes committed in Aitkin County. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton condemned the deputy's death and offered condolences to his family. \\"I deplore the terrible, senseless murder of Deputy Sheriff Steven Sandberg,\\" Dayton said in a statement. A woman answering the phone at Sandberg's home said nobody from the family was ready to comment. Hammond's home does not have a listed phone number. ||||| A violent “whirlwind of events” in a St. Cloud Hospital room early Sunday morning left two men dead, including a 24-year veteran of the Aitkin County sheriff’s office. The man who shot him was tased by another sheriff’s deputy and died at the scene, authorities said. “A suspect being treated at St. Cloud Hospital shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy who had been monitoring the welfare of the suspect who was a subject of an investigation outside the St. Cloud tri-county area,” said Jill Oliveira, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The BCA said the incident was confined to the suspect’s hospital room, and no one else was injured. The deputy was identified as Steven M. Sandberg, 60, who had been with the Sheriff’s Office since 1991 and working as an investigator for the past 20 years. The suspect was Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said during a news conference in St. Cloud. Hammond, of rural Aitkin, was in the hospital for medical reasons following a domestic situation, Evans said. The deputy was identified as Investigator Steven Martin Sandberg, who was 60 years old and is survived by a wife and daughter. He had worked with the Aitkin County Sheriff's Office since 1991. Photo provided by family members to KSTP. Hammond was not in police custody, Evans said, but he was being monitored by law enforcement “at the request of St. Cloud Hospital.” He was not handcuffed, Evans added. A struggle ensued after the suspect got out of his bed, Evans said, and Hammond got hold of Sandberg’s gun and squeezed off several rounds. A deputy from the same Sheriff’s Office tased Hammond, and the suspect “became unresponsive,” Evans said. Life-saving efforts were begun in the emergency room, but Hammond died, the superintendent said. Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said the incident was a “whirlwind of events in [a] very tragic situation.” Sandberg leaves behind a wife and daughter, Turner said. A hearse carrying Sandberg’s body from St. Cloud to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office on Sunday afternoon was escorted by dozens of police vehicles in a motorcade along Interstate 94. Hammond’s criminal history includes felony convictions for burglary and fleeing custody, both cases from roughly 25 years ago. Law enforcement scanner conversation of the unfolding pre-dawn scene was captured by the MN Police Clips website. “We do have an officer down in South 527,” came the word from the hospital to dispatch. “We have deputy that is shot … the shooter is in handcuffs.” Dispatch described the shooter as “an inmate ... and the inmate is now in custody.” An officer on the scene said the “guy got gun away from deputy, shot deputy” and the suspect went into cardiac arrest. The weapon was recovered, the officer added. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Gov. Mark Dayton said, “I deplore this terrible, senseless murder. ... This tragedy reminds us that Minnesota’s law enforcement officers risk their lives every day and night to keep us safe.” |||||","completion":"A suspect involved in a domestic incident being treated at St. Cloud Hospital in Minnesota managed to seize a gun from a sheriff's deputy and fatally shot the officer.

Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers was raised in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often reported that she was born in Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers dreamed of having a career in mainstream films and believed her celebrity as the star of Behind the Green Door and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. \\"The paradox was that, as a result of Green Door, Hollywood blackballed me,\\" she said later. \\"[Green Door] became a very high-grossing film...But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me to do anything else, as an actress, was totally out of the question. I became known as a porno star, and that type of labeling really hurt me. It hurt my chances of doing anything else\\". Throughout the 1970s she was up for roles in several Hollywood films. Her biggest opportunity came in 1976 when it was announced in Variety that she was to star alongside Rip Torn in City Blues, a film about a young hooker defended by a seedy lawyer. The film was to be directed by Nicholas Ray. Ray had never seen Behind the Green Door or even screen-tested Chambers. Instead the two met and Ray was impressed. \\"I have a camera in my head,\\" he said, adding that Chambers would \\"eventually be able to handle anything that the young Katie Hepburn or Bette Davis could.\\" However, the project never came to fruition, in large part due to Ray's alcohol and drug abuse. Chambers claimed that Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel brought her in to talk about a role in the 1978 film Goin' South, then asked her for cocaine and grilled her about whether her orgasms in Behind the Green Door were real; she was angered to the point where she stormed out of the interview. She was going to be cast in the film Hardcore, opposite George C. Scott, but the casting director took one look at her and said she was too wholesome to be cast as a porn queen. \\"The Hardcore people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels.

Please answer the following question: Q: Practical limits of van de graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually do what to surrounding materials? Choices: - displace - isolate - decompose - ionize A: Answer:","completion":"A: Ionize A detailed explanation of the answer: Van de Graaff generators produce high voltages and lead to large electric fields, which arise due to the accumulation of charges on the surface of the large metallic sphere that is typically a part of the generator design. The main principle behind the Van de Graaff generator is the triboelectric effect, where the charges are transferred from one medium to another by friction. When we discuss the practical limits of Van de Graaff generators, we need to consider several factors, including the presence of insulating materials, system design issues, and the surrounding environment. One of the most important factors affecting the generator's output relates to the large electric field created by the charges on the sphere. This large electric field polarizes the surrounding materials. Polarization is a process where electric charges, such as positive and negative charges, get separated in an insulating material due to an external electric field being applied to it. If the electric field strength is increased further, these surrounding materials get more and more polarized. At a certain point, the electric field reaches a level where it can ionize the surrounding materials. Ionization refers to the process where an atom or a molecule loses or gains one or more electrons, giving it a positive or negative charge (i.e., turning it into an ion). The electric field is strong enough to overcome the binding force between atoms or molecules and their electrons. When the materials around the Van de Graaff generator start to ionize, it causes electrical breakdown or discharge, as the generated ions create a conducting path for electric current. This electrical discharge can be seen in the form of sparks or corona discharges appearing around the generator, leading to a loss of charge from the generator and reducing its performance. In summary, the practical limits of Van de Graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize the surrounding materials.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, not least because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \\"Car of the Future\\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer. Better than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating and sleepiness. Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. Many accidents are caused by people following the car in front too closely. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle . For city streets, expect other radar devices that will give advance warning that the car in front of you has slowed abruptly and you should...

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose an earthquake just occurred happens, how will it affect MORE or STRONGER earthquakes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an earthquake has the potential to trigger more or stronger earthquakes in the subsequent period. This influence can be both direct and indirect on the overall earthquake process. Let's break it down: 1. Direct effects: When an earthquake occurs, it releases stress stored in the Earth's crust along the fault lines. However, this stress may not be completely dissipated, and some of it could be redistributed to nearby fault lines or regions. This redistribution of stress can increase the likelihood or strength of subsequent earthquakes in those areas, as the newly transferred stress could further destabilize existing fault lines and cause them to slip. 2. Indirect effects: Earthquakes may also cause indirect effects that contribute to more or stronger earthquakes in the future. One example is the impact of earthquakes on the crustal structure and rock properties, which can potentially make the crust more susceptible to future seismic events. Additionally, earthquakes may result in alterations of groundwater or fluid pressure in the Earth's subsurface, which can further weaken faults and potentially lead to more earthquakes. 3. Aftershocks: Earthquakes also frequently produce aftershocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur as a result of the initial earthquake. Aftershocks can continue to occur for days, weeks, months or even years after the main event, although they decrease in frequency and magnitude over time. These aftershocks can still cause significant damage, additional stress redistribution, and may contribute to more or stronger earthquakes in the long run. 4. Cascading effect: The concept of an earthquake triggering another earthquake, sometimes referred to as \\"earthquake cascading,\\" is a complex and not yet fully understood phenomenon. It is known that earthquakes can lead to more fault slips and aftershocks, which can impact the overall seismic hazard in a region. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis proposes that an earthquake can directly and indirectly affect the occurrence and strength of future earthquakes. Although the exact mechanisms and extent of such earthquake triggering are not fully understood, there is evidence that stress redistribution, aftershocks, and cascading effects can all play a role in increasing the likelihood or strength of subsequent earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The film then goes back one year before the massacre, to Jerusalem where Zachariah is a rabbi and making an offering, when he gets told by the Archangel Gabriel that his wife will bear a son by a vision. He states that he is too old, and is told by Gabriel that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. It then goes to the town of Nazareth, where a teenaged girl named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is farming, and soldiers come to collect taxes, one man, who is unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery to pay his debt. Mary is then, betrothed to marry Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by the Angel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \\"Jesus\\". He then tells that her God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) with a child despite her old age. Mary asks her parents and Joseph could she visit with Elizabeth before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and her husband the priest Zachariah (Stanley Townsend), who regains his speech after he refused to believe the Angel Gabriel's news that he would have a son.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

If \\"some people sitting around a table, one yawning.\\", does this mean that \\"A group of people are sitting at table together.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"some people sitting around a table, one yawning\\" can be rephrased as \\"A group of people are sitting at a table together.\\" Both of these expressions describe a similar scenario, but they emphasize different aspects of the situation. In the first phrase, \\"some people sitting around a table, one yawning,\\" the focus is on the fact that there are multiple people gathered around a table, and one of them is yawning. This depiction creates a visual image of the scene and highlights the yawning person, suggesting that the situation might be casual, relaxed, or possibly tiring for at least one individual. On the other hand, the expression \\"A group of people are sitting at a table together\\" emphasizes the collective aspect of the people involved. This statement is more general and neutral, as it does not mention any specific actions or feelings of the people at the table. It simply states that there is a group of people sharing a communal space and activity, which could encompass a range of scenarios, such as a meal, a meeting, or a casual conversation. However, both statements describe the fundamental elements of the scene: there are multiple people and a table. In both cases, these people are sitting in close proximity to one another, which implies a sense of connection or shared purpose among them.

John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world.

Article: I recall my mother's voice which called me to order, and often ended with some strong proverb to express the gravity of the wrong done. It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was more imperative to Harris than German morale?\\" is in \\"AOC Bomber Command Arthur Harris did see German morale as a major objective. However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command's offensives was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, he declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve \\"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.\\" A summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear:\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"According to the passage you provided from \\"AOC Bomber Command Arthur Harris,\\" the thing that was more imperative to Harris than German morale was the destruction of the German industrial base (economic warfare). He believed that the morale-collapse in Germany could not occur without first destroying the German economy. This objective was the primary aim of Bomber Command's offensives.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Determine the sentiment: There's a good movie lurking here, but this isn't it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved. For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind. Yet they wear surgical masks some times, not others. Some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unconcerned. Worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-be-killed world, these people constantly behave like total newbs. They don't bother accumulating proper equipment, or food. They're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them. So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense. On top of all this, we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd, when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note: arrogant and boneheaded. It's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range. On the positive side, the film *looks* excellent. It's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is largely negative. The reviewer acknowledges that the basic premise of the film is good, but they are critical of the movie's execution, specifically its logic and development of characters. They point out inconsistencies in the behavior of the characters, and how their actions often make no sense, undermining any moral struggles presented. There is also dissatisfaction with Chris Pine's acting, as they claim it is limited and lacks variety. However, there is a positive note in this review concerning the film's visuals and appearance, which the reviewer praises as suitable for the setting. Despite this, they ultimately recommend avoiding the movie, even for fans of the genre, as the weak writing and poorly developed characters outweigh the positive aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu haven't liked each other for years -- they just aren't bothering to hide it anymore. Long time observers of the U.S.-Israeli relationship struggle to remember when the personal chemistry between the leaders of the two countries was so bad. Even the Israeli prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering \\"old couple.\\" The latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged Tuesday when a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli leader a \\"chickens**t\\" who doesn't match war talk with action.

The first paragraph sets up a discussion about the strained personal relationship between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu. Therefore, when the sentence cuts off at \\"The Netanyahu-\\", it makes sense to continue with \\"-Barack Obama relationship\\" because this coincides with the main focal point of the passage - the relationship between these two specific individuals. Completing the sentence in this way allows the narrative to naturally progress from outlining their poor relationship to providing specific details about how this manifests. This makes the passage coherent and maintains the flow of the narrative. The other options such as \\"Atlantic relationship\\" or \\"Jeffrey Goldberg relationship\\" aren't suited as they refer to entities and people not directly involved in the main narrative of the poor relationship between Obama and Netanyahu. And while terms like \\"Israel relationship\\" or \\"U.S. relationship\\" do relate to the national relations, they are too broad and do not directly address the personal relationship that's main focus of the passage.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer? from the following article ? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Here is a question about this article: Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east, as with the west, as not a matter of intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control. What is the answer to this question: What type of city-states were involved with the Roman Republic?","completion":"The city-states involved with the Roman Republic were primarily independent city-states and kingdoms that had varying degrees of independence, both de jure (legally) and de facto (in practice). These city-states and kingdoms maintained alliances and dependencies with Rome, which was the central power in this network. These city-states and kingdoms could be categorized into several groups: 1. Latin and Italian city-states: These were the cities and territories in the Italian peninsula, which were close to Rome and shared its culture and language. Examples include the Latin cities, Etruscan city-states, and the Samnite tribes. They formed alliances with Rome, and many were eventually integrated into the Roman political system as citizens or allies. 2. Greek city-states: These were the cities in the Hellenistic world that stretched from the eastern Mediterranean to western Asia. Important Greek city-states that were involved with the Roman Republic include Athens, Corinth, and Smyrna. They initially entered into alliances with Rome to counter the growing power of the Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom. 3. Hellenistic kingdoms: These large kingdoms were formed in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests and were ruled by his former generals and their successors. They were often involved in wars with Rome or other Hellenistic kingdoms and sought alliances with the Roman Republic. Examples include the aforementioned Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom, as well as the Kingdom of Pergamon and the Kingdom of Macedon. 4. Eastern kingdoms and states: These were the non-Greek territories further east, such as Anatolia, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. They were usually under the rule of local dynasties or Hellenistic rulers who were influenced by both Greek and Eastern cultures. Examples include the Kingdom of Pontus, Nabatean Kingdom, and the Parthian Empire. Their interactions with Rome included both alliances and conflicts, depending on the geopolitical situation at the time. 5. Western Mediterranean and North African states: These were the city-states and kingdoms located primarily in modern-day Spain, France, and North Africa. They were often under the rule of local tribes or dynasties, and their interactions with Rome included both alliances and military conflicts. Examples include the Carthaginian Empire, Numidian Kingdom, and various Celtic and Iberian tribes. Overall, the city-states involved with the Roman Republic were diverse in their origins, cultures, and political structures, and they engaged in a complex web of alliances and dependencies with Rome. As the Roman Republic grew in power and influence, many of these city-states were eventually incorporated into the Roman political system, either voluntarily or through conquest, which contributed to the eventual formation of the Roman Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which seventh-generation console floundered late in it's lifespan? Context: The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360.

'Can' suggests the possibility or potential for federal agencies to adopt 'them' (it's not specified what 'them' refers to, but that's not critical in understanding the logic). It means the agencies are allowed to adopt, but are not compulsorily needed to. On the other hand, the phrase 'will have to' indicates a stronger sense of obligation or necessity. It implies that there's no choice in the matter and federal agencies are absolutely required to adopt 'all' of 'them.' Because the premise only speaks to possibility and not obligation, and doesn't specifically state that every single one of 'them' can be adopted, it's impossible to make a logical jump to the conclusion that federal agencies will have to adopt all of them. The premise doesn't provide enough information to support this hypothesis. Thus, more information would be necessary to confirm this. For example, we would need further data or rules specifying that all options must be adopted once available for adoption, or any other directive or law that mandates such an action from federal agencies. To summarize, while the premise suggests that federal agencies have the capability and potential authority to adopt 'them,' it does not confirm the notion that they are compelled to adopt all of 'them.'

I thought I might be the only person left in the world who hadn't done an eBay deal. So,I decided to try my hand at online auction . Buying for beginners:Sign up on _ . Most items(e.g. tables, computers, and books) ready for auction will come with a picture and a short description;others may be marked with \\"Buy It Now\\" and have a fixed price. You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned,you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you. The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid,then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal,an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card . Selling made simple:If you plan to sell on eBay,it helps to include a picture of the item. I followed my friends' advice and put up the items I wanted to sell for a 10-day auction,starting on a Thursday. This way, buyers had two weekends to bid. The big things in life:It' s easy to post a small item,but furniture is a big part of eBay and this has to be collected or sent by deliverymen . Check the ways of delivery before you bid. Question: After bidding for an item,a buyer _ Options: A: will get what he wants in ten days B: should make payment immediately C: has chances to make higher bids D: may check its picture and description Answer:","completion":"C: has chances to make higher bids"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The scenario suggests that more baby birds will grow into adults, which means there will be an increase in the number of birds. This increase will have an effect on the overall bird population, leading to an indirect impact on at least one step of the process. For example, the larger number of adult birds may lead to increased competition for resources, such as food and nesting sites. This competition could potentially make it more challenging for some birds to find a mate, build a nest, or even lay eggs in a safe environment. Consequently, a higher number of birds may not be able to successfully complete the entire life cycle, indirectly causing some steps of the process to be less effective for certain individuals.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Don't drive your kids to school. Let them ride a bike to school. In England 8.3 million children travel to school every day. It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike? Safety is the number one worry for them. But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is.

Here's the stepwise breakdown: 1. Extracting information: The initial statement says, \\"The technology that shapes the modern world is as incomprehensible to most people as the forces of nature were to a society of hunter-gatherers.\\" This indicates that most people do not fully understand the technology shaping the modern world, just as hunter-gatherers did not fully understand nature. 2. Initial reasoning: The statement suggests a lack of understanding among people about modern technology, rather than their familiarity or capability to operate within it. 3. Contradiction identification: The conclusion, \\"They were amazed at the majority of people in tune with the modern world they live in,\\" implies that people are in tune with or adept at navigating the modern world, in this case presumably shaped by technology. This contradicts the initial statement that most people find the technology incomprehensible. 4. Final reasoning: We don't have information that supports surprise or amazement at people's familiarity with the modern world, nor do we know who 'they' refers to. Without further context or information that connects these ideas, we can't directly derive the suggested conclusion from the initial statement.

Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A lot more negatives than positives Review: I bought this seat for my 3 year old hoping that he would get more freedom than he had in his older car seat. Well he got his freedom alright. I could not keep him in the seat. The harness system is entirley way too easy for children to figure out and he did figure it out in 1 day. I had the same problem just using the belt and tether straps. He kept undoing the seat belt.Another issue. When I actually did have him in the seat the straps are a major pain... They twist on a daily basis and are a pain to fix. I also was unable to get the straps tight enough.I think the only way you can recline this seat is if it is not in your car. I have a mini-van and a suv and could not recline the seats.The only plus about this seat was that it is a nice looking seat. Looks don't save lives though.I ended up buying a incredibly inexpensive low back booster and my child hasn't got out of it yet. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. The reviewer lists a series of issues they experienced with the car seat, beginning with the inability to keep their child securely in the seat due to the harness system being too easy to figure out. This issue poses a significant safety concern, as the primary purpose of a car seat is to restrain a child during car rides. The reviewer also mentions difficulties with the belt and tether straps, stating that their child was able to undo the seat belt. Further supporting the negative tone, the reviewer cites problems with the car seat straps such as daily twisting and difficulty in adjusting them to be tight enough. Another issue raised is the impracticality of the reclining feature, which could not be achieved in either of their vehicles. The one positive aspect that the reviewer acknowledges is the car seat's aesthetic appeal. However, they immediately counter this aspect by emphasizing that appearance is not a factor in ensuring the safety and well-being of a child. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that they eventually purchased a low-cost alternative that successfully kept their child secure in the car seat, suggesting that the original car seat failed to meet their basic expectations. In conclusion, the negative tone heavily outweighs the minor positive remark in this product review. The reviewer's numerous issues and concerns with the car seat's safety, functionality, and overall usability are what shape this unfavorable perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Kennedy’s Assassination: How LIFE Brought the Zapruder Film to Light\\"","completion":"Title: Kennedy’s Assassination: How LIFE Brought the Zapruder Film to Light Introduction The assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, shook the world. As news of the tragic event spread, journalists scrambled to find details of the incident that would soon become one of the most significant moments in American history. LIFE magazine played a pivotal role in shedding light on the assassination, particularly through the acquisition of the Zapruder film – a crucial piece of evidence capturing the entire event. This article explores the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's assassination, the importance of the Zapruder film, and how LIFE magazine's involvement helped bring this vital piece of historical footage to light. The Assassination of John F. Kennedy On a bright and sunny day in Dallas, Texas, President John F. Kennedy was riding in a convertible limousine during a campaign motorcade through the streets of the city. Crowds had gathered along the route to catch a glimpse of the charismatic leader. As the car made its way through Dealey Plaza, a series of gunshots rang out, and within moments, the President had been struck in the neck and head. Kennedy was rushed to Dallas Parkland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. The assassination sent shockwaves around the globe, with many struggling to come to terms with the horrific act. In the days that followed, the nation was gripped by the unfolding investigation, which led to the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald as the prime suspect. Two days later, Oswald was fatally shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, further deepening the conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's death. The Zapruder Film In the aftermath of the assassination, it became apparent that a Dallas dress manufacturer named Abraham Zapruder had inadvertently captured the entire incident on his 8mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera. Standing atop a concrete pedestal near Elm Street, Zapruder's 26-second film proved instrumental in piecing together the sequence of events that unfolded on that fateful day. The film's significance was immediately recognized, and within hours, representatives from various news agencies sought to purchase the rights to the footage. Recognizing the historic and evidentiary value of the film, Zapruder shared his concerns about the footage's potential to sensationalize or exploit the President's death, ultimately deciding to entrust the material to a reputable publication – LIFE magazine. LIFE Magazine's Involvement On November 23, 1963, one day after the assassination, LIFE magazine's Richard Stolley contacted Abraham Zapruder and persuaded him to grant LIFE the rights to his footage. Zapruder agreed to sell the print rights for 50,000, with the understanding that the footage would be handled with discretion and sensitivity. Zapruder's film ultimately played a pivotal role in shaping the public's understanding of the assassination. In the December 6, 1963 issue, LIFE published a selection of black-and-white frames from the film, accompanied by a detailed article that carefully analyzed the footage. However, the complete film in its original color format remained under lock and key in the magazine's vaults, with only select sections being shared with governmental investigation committees. In 1966, the magazine sold the film back to the Zapruder family for 1, with the agreement that the US government would have access to the footage. This marked the beginning of a lengthy debate over who owned the rights to the film and when, or if, it would be made available to the public. It wouldn't be until March 1975 that the Zapruder film would finally be shown in its entirety on national television by ABC News, reigniting the public's interest in Kennedy's assassination. Conclusion LIFE magazine's acquisition and handling of the Zapruder film played a vital role in unveiling the chilling details of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. By ensuring its discretion, the publication aided in promoting a thoughtful and serious analysis of the incident, without sensationalizing or exploiting the tragedy. As a result, the Zapruder film remains an essential artifact in understanding the events in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, serving as a powerful witness to a moment that would forever change the course of American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day in autumn, when she is on her way to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox flees from her, but the girl feels a strong desire to meet the fox again.During the following months, she spends most of her free time in the forests, exploring the nature, observing many different animals, but above all searching for the fox. Yet, she never sees the fox again before winter comes. During the winter, already knowing how to distinguish the tracks various animals leave in the snow, she follows fox's traces far across the fields, through woods and thickets. Still, she does not find the fox, but instead, she is terrified by the howling of wolves close by. In panic, she tries to run home, but seriously hurts her ankle during her flight.The film does not explain how she manages to get back home at all; maybe, she manages to walk despite her injury, maybe her parents miss her, search for her and carry her back. In any case, the healing of her injured leg takes all the rest of the winter. She cannot leave the house any more, but spends lots of time reading books about the wild animals of the woods, above all about foxes.During springtime, the girl resumes her roaming in the woods. She already knows how to identify fox's kennels. Finding many of them, she finds some empty, some blocked by people who consider foxes harmful animals that should be hunted down and killed. But she also finds a kennel that's obviously inhabited. Sitting down behind the bushes some dozens of meters away from the kennel, she patiently waits for the fox to come out or to come home. But the fox, having cast its young, is particularly shy and wary, not showing itself when the girl is near. In fact, it is so disquieted that it starts removing its young to a different hole in order to hide them from the spying human. By chance, just when the fox carries one of its young out of the kennel,...

Prior to this, he was a leading figure in the independence movement and then the new government, and played a crucial role in facilitating and protecting Botswanas steady financial growth and development. - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates. - Lenyeletse Seretse ( 25 June 1920 -- 3 January 1983 ) was Vice-President of Botswana from 1980 until his death on 3 January 1983 .

Answer this question. Which language is common to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism?","completion":"Sanskrit is the common language to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that has its roots in the Indian subcontinent. Often referred to as the \\"mother\\" of many of the modern Indian languages, Sanskrit has played a significant role in the development of these religions, providing a common linguistic ground for their texts, scriptures, and philosophical discussions. 1. Sanskrit in Hinduism: Sanskrit is integrally connected to Hinduism and has been considered the sacred language of the religion. It is the language of the ancient Hindu scriptures, called the Vedas, which contain various hymns and incantations, as well as the Upanishads, which are philosophical texts that discuss the nature of reality and human existence. The two great Hindu epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are also written in Sanskrit. The language is also used in various Hindu rituals, prayers, and ceremonies. Scholars dedicated to the study of Hinduism have largely studied the religion and its texts in Sanskrit, as it provides an accurate understanding of the material and captures the nuances of the original text. 2. Sanskrit in Buddhism: Though the Buddha himself gave sermons in the local languages of the regions he traveled, many Buddhist texts were later recorded in Sanskrit. This language provided a common mode of communication for the diverse Buddhist communities that emerged throughout India and neighboring countries. The major Buddhist scriptures, known as the Mahayana Sutras, were written in Sanskrit. Some of the important texts include the Heart Sutra, the Diamond Sutra, and the Lotus Sutra. Additionally, many early Buddhist philosophers, such as Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, and Asanga, wrote treatises and commentaries in Sanskrit, which played a significant role in the development of Buddhist thought. 3. Sanskrit in Jainism: Jainism, another major religion of the Indian subcontinent, also shares its connection with Sanskrit. Jain canonical texts, called Agamas, were initially passed down orally in the local language of Ardha Magadhi, but they were later translated into Sanskrit to reach a broader audience and to preserve the teachings of Jainism from oblivion. Some key Jain texts like the Tattvartha Sutra, a comprehensive work on Jain philosophy, and the Jaina Sutras, which contain the teachings of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, were written in Sanskrit. The language has also been used by Jain scholars to compose commentaries and expositions on various aspects of Jainism, such as the celebrated work 'Dravyasamgraha' by Acharya Nemicandra. In conclusion, Sanskrit is the common language that connects Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It has been the language of scriptures, prayers, literature, and philosophical debates in these religions, contributing to their development and expansion. It has become a classical language of India and continues to be indispensable for those who study these religions and their texts from a historical and scholarly perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Deepak Tijori (born 28 August 1961) is an Indian film director and actor who works in Bollywood films and is well known for his supporting roles in \\"Aashiqui\\" (1990), \\"Khiladi\\" (1992), \\"Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar\\" (1992), \\"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa\\" (1993), \\"Anjaam\\" (1994), \\"Ghulam\\" (1998) and \\"Baadshah\\" (1999).

NT Labor has long shopping list for govt Don Dale, economic stimulus, establishing an anti-corruption commission: the Northern Territory’s chief minister-elect already has a long list of what he wants to start working on. On Sunday morning Michael Gunner did the rounds at Nightcliff Markets in Darwin, buying his favourite laksa and being congratulated by locals on winning a landslide victory to government. With about half the votes counted on Saturday night, Mr Gunner said Labor was calling 15 seats and is still in play in six others, with the Country Liberals so far taking one and independents three. It may still be 10 days or so before the final make-up of the government is known, he told reporters. But he said he wanted to speak with the Manufacturers’ Council and the Chamber of Commerce about implementing “Buy Local” plans, and will be seeking a meeting with the Corrections Commissioner and the Department of Justice CEO, as well as Aboriginal peak organisations and the NT Council of Social Services to discuss Don Dale youth detention centre. “(I want) to make sure we start on the right foot even now about how we handle these issues; we want to do them differently, better and together,” Mr Gunner said. He wants to begin establishing an anti-corruption commission and a judicial inquiry into political donations, to talk to the Taxi Council about paving the way for ride sharing, and said Labor’s first homebuyers’ grant would be effective as of Thursday. There are still questions around whether the CLP will win four seats to form a viable opposition, or whether independents will do so. Mr Gunner said he would do “absolutely nothing to cripple accountability”. “We want to have resourced independents and opposition in the NT, I’ m not going to be playing what I would think would be foolish games here with how those people are resourced to hold us to account,” he said. Labor had learned from the CLP’s mistakes over the past term, he said. “We should take those lessons and apply them to the next four (years) and recognise it is a privilege and an honour to be here,” Mr Gunner said. “It can very easily and very quickly be taken away from you if you don ’t honour the commission that’s been granted to you… If you even for a second put your interest ahead of Territorians’ interest you will be gone.” He said the primary emotion he felt on Saturday night was relief, but that the hard work had already begun. “I felt no joy in the result of the CLP, I felt joy in what my team returned,” he said. “They ’re not enemies, they ’re Territorians; I’ d like to think we have a contest of ideas and will continue to have a contest of ideas.” The NT Electoral Commission will resume vote-counting on Monday.

Fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a letter to put in an envelop.Folding the dough will create flaky layers throughout the biscuit.; Answer:","completion":"The best way to create flaky layers in biscuits is to use option 2: Fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a letter to put in an envelop. Folding the dough will create flaky layers throughout the biscuit. In order to achieve the perfect flaky layers, it is important to follow these steps: 1. Prepare ingredients: Make sure your ingredients are measured accurately and your butter is cold. Cold butter is crucial for creating flaky layers within the dough. When it melts, it creates pockets of air, resulting in a flaky texture. 2. Combine ingredients: In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Afterward, cut the cold butter into small cubes. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter, fork, or your fingertips to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 3. Add liquid ingredients: Stir in the cold milk or buttermilk, which helps to create tender layers in the biscuits. Be careful not to over-mix the dough; this can result in tough, hard biscuits. 4. Roll out and fold the dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press the dough into a rectangle. To create the flaky layers, fold the dough into thirds, like you would fold a letter to put in an envelope. Then, press and roll out the dough again, repeating this folding process at least 2-3 times. This technique will result in multiple layers of dough, ensuring flakiness throughout. 5. Cut biscuits: Use a round biscuit cutter or a knife to cut out the biscuits. Press straight down without twisting, as twisting can seal the layers and prevent the biscuits from rising. 6. Bake: Place the cut biscuits onto a lined baking sheet, making sure they are close together but not touching. Bake in a preheated oven (usually around 425°F / 220°C) for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. 7. Serve: Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before enjoying them. They are best served warm, with a pat of butter or a dollop of jam. By following these detailed steps and folding the dough like a letter, you will be able to create the desired flaky layers in your homemade biscuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you are asking about the first \\"form of government\\" in the United States, the answer would be the Continental Congress. If you meant to ask about the first \\"president\\" or \\"head of government,\\" the answer would be George Washington. Here's a more detailed explanation for each identification. 1) First Form of Government: The Continental Congress Before the United States became the organized nation that it is today, the Continental Congress was the principal governing body during the period of the American Revolution (1774-1789). The Continental Congress had two incarnations: the First Continental Congress (1774) and the Second Continental Congress (1775-1781). The First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, in response to the British Parliament's Coercive Acts, also known as the 'Intolerable Acts'. This initiating assembly of delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies addressed grievances they had with British rule and sought to establish a unified colonial resistance. The Second Continental Congress began its sessions on May 10, 1775, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The delegates from the thirteen colonies convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and effectively served as the country's national government during the conflict. This Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, and later established the Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States from 1781 until 1789. 2) First President of the United States: George Washington George Washington was the first president of the United States, serving from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797. Washington was elected unanimously by the Electoral College before serving two terms in office. He was a significant figure in the founding of the United States, initially gaining prominence as the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Upon winning the war, Washington was widely recognized as a critical figure in the creation of the United States Constitution, which established the blueprint for the country's new government. As the nation's first president, Washington was instrumental in forming the new government under the Constitution and setting precedents for future administrations. It is important to note the distinction between these two instances. The Continental Congress, in both its forms, was the first governing body of the United States during the Revolutionary period, whereas George Washington was the first president under the current United States federal government established by the Constitution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alain secretly imprisons Edmond in his dungeon for 20 years and convinces Blanche that her father is dead. Alain intends to further debase Blanche as revenge against Edmond. Alain tricks a high-born drunken cad, Denis de Beaulieu, in to believeing he has murdered a man. Denis escapes a mob by entering the Maletroit chateau by an exterior door which has no latch on the inside. Alain makes Denis a captive intending to force the delicate Blanche into marriage with him. Alain goes to the dungeon to torture Edmond with the news Blanche will be married to Denis, an unworthy rogue. After Alain leaves, Edmond asks the family servant Voltan to kill Denis before the wedding. However, Denis shows unanticipated redemptive qualities and he and Blanche fall in love. When Voltan comes to kill Denis, Blanche pleads with Voltan to spare his life and help him escape.

The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage.

Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases.

Summarize this article: Like Vipassana meditation, Anapanasati is about quiet mindfulness. The first step, then, is to find a suitable location. The Buddha recommended three: the forest, the foot of a tree, or an isolated or empty spot. Silence is essential to Anapanasati, especially for beginners. For you, a quiet room might be best. A secluded woods or beach might also work well. Silence will help you to develop concentration. If you cannot find complete silence, aim for somewhere that is quiet and private. People can meditate in several different postures, like standing, reclining, sitting, and walking. Sitting is the best for Anapanasati. Ideally, you should take a cross-legged position with both feet turned up and resting on your thighs, i.e. the lotus position. Don’t worry if you can’t take the lotus position. It is also acceptable to sit half cross-legged, with one leg slightly bent. You should also sit erect. Your torso should be upright but not tense or rigid. Imagine that all the bones in your spine are linked together. As for your hands, they should lay gently on your lap. Like in Vipassana, the right hand is traditionally atop the left with the palms up. Your eyes can be closed, half-closed, or open – whichever is most comfortable – and your head should be tilted downward, your nose perpendicular to the navel. The focus of your mindfulness in Anapanasati will again be breathing. Turn your mind toward the rising and falling, the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. Follow the sensations involved and be aware of them. Be especially mindful of the place when the breath enters and leaves your nostrils. This will be a spot just under your nose or above your upper lip. Center on the spot where the breath touches the skin. Be aware: when you breathe in, recognize that you’re breathing in. Likewise when you are breathing out. However, don’t try to control or hold back your breathing. As your awareness of breathing increases, it will become less willful. ” There are eight graduated steps in Anapanasati meditation, each one working up to nirvana. The basic and most rudimentary level is “counting.” Counting is intended for those with no background in the technique. People with experience in meditation may not need it and can begin with the second level. Fix your attention on the tip of your nose, as said. Now, count the movements of your breath. For example, you might count the first inhalation as “one, one” and the first exhalation as “two, two.” Continue to the tenth breath (“ten, ten”) before returning to “one, one.” If you lose track, start again at “one, one.” The counting itself is not meditation. It instead helps to calm the wandering mind, by making you aware when you become distracted and lose the count. In Anapanasati there are eight total steps. To get further in the technique, you will slowly be able to move into higher levels. “Following” comes next. Once you have calmed your mind with counting, you should be able to mentally track or “follow” the course of your breath without keeping track. Following just means to follow the breath with the mind. You do not deliberately breathe in or out, but only remain aware that it takes place. Try to see the beginning, the middle, and the end of each cycle of breaths. This practice is called \\"experiencing the whole body.\\" “Contact” and “Fixing” come next. These both require stronger concentration and are harder to attain. People who reach this level may feel they have stopped breathing altogether, because they are so calm that it’s hard to feel the action of the breath. They must keep focused on the spot under the nostrils. Many report calm, joy, or even powerful visions. Very few people make it to the upper steps of the technique. “Observing,” “turning away,” “purification,” and “retrospection” will take you to higher paths of self-awareness. If you want to achieve these higher grades, you will most likely need to find a spiritual master to guide you. Consider attending a meditation retreat – monasteries and other centers around the world host such retreats, in many cases as a free service to the community. Summary:","completion":"Anapanasati is a form of mindfulness meditation focused on breathing. To practice it, find a quiet location like a forest, beach, or secluded room. Sit in a comfortable position, ideally cross-legged, with an upright but relaxed posture and hands resting gently on your lap. Focus on your breath and its sensations, with awareness of the spot where it enters and leaves your nostrils. There are eight graduated steps in Anapanasati, starting with counting breaths to calm the wandering mind, moving onto following the course of the breath, and eventually leading to higher levels of self-awareness that may require guidance from a spiritual master. Meditation retreats at monasteries and centers worldwide can provide instruction and guidance for those seeking to advance in Anapanasati practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The review consists of praising words and highlights the filmmakers' success in meeting the expectations of both long-time Tolkien fans and movie-goers who may not be familiar with the source material. The review starts by mentioning the renowned director Peter Jackson and his company, implying that the critic has a level of respect for their previous works and acknowledges their role in creating the film. The words 'dazzle' and 'delight' demonstrate the critic's satisfaction and enjoyment, presenting a sensory and enthusiastic aspect to their reaction.

You can't even afford it.\\" \\"I'd pay you back.\\" How could he explain his fascination with the Vehicular Age to her? The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. Question: Does Aage's mom own a car? Options: - not enough information - No, she drives Aage's fathers car - No, she is unable to drive - Yes, a MG-TD === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"not enough information. From the given text, we cannot definitively determine if Aage's mom owns a car or not. The story focuses on Aage's fascination with the classic 1952 MG-TD and his desire to own one.

However, the text does not provide any specific information about her car ownership, whether she drives Aage's father's car, or if she is unable to drive.

The Kangxi Emperor was the fourth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, ruling from 1661-1722. Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, was occupied by the Qing army during his reign in 1720, which is the event inquired about in the question. The Kangxi Emperor's interest in Tibet began in the early 1700s, especially due to the strategic importance of the region and the ongoing influence of the Mongols, with whom the Qing Dynasty continually interacted. The Mongol Dzungars invaded Tibet in the aftermath of the death of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1682, and the political uncertainty that ensued. However, Dzungar occupation was quite brutal and Tibetans sought assistance from the neighboring Qing Dynasty. In 1717, the situation escalated, with the Dzungars overtaking Tibet and killing Lochen Desi, the King of Tibet. This prompted the Kangxi Emperor to intervene and send a Qing expedition in 1720, ultimately seizing control of Lhasa and expelling the Dzungars. The event marked the beginning of Qing's influence in the region, and consequently, the 7th Dalai Lama was reinstated to his position by the emperor. The statement provided, however, refers to the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, the sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who ruled from 1735-1796. The establishment of the permanent Qing garrison and protectorate occurred in 1751, long after the Kangxi Emperor's reign. The involvement of different emperors and the different historical events that happened during their reigns must be taken into consideration when answering the question properly. Hence, a better answer to the question \\"When did the Kangxi Emperor occupy Lhasa?\\" would be: The Kangxi Emperor occupied Lhasa in 1720, after sending a Qing expedition to expel the invading Mongol Dzungars and subsequently putting the Tibet region under Qing influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two men are not particularly concerned about what she is telling them. They mention that the facility in Japan will get the job done, and that their U.S. facility usually comes in second place. As they board a golf cart and drive off, the younger of the two men invites the older one to come over to his house for the upcoming weekend.The scene shifts to a room in a college town where Dana (Kristen Connolly) and Jules (Anna Hutchison) are talking about school. Apparently, Dana had an affair with one of her professors and it ended badly. Jules's boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth) walks in and throws a football at the girls. It flies out the window and Curt's friend Holden (Jesse Williams), a fix-up for Dana, catches it down below. The guys are there to pick up the girls for a long weekend at a lakeside cabin that Curt's cousin owns. Dana finishes packing and they all go downstairs to pack up the RV. They are about to leave when their friend Marty pulls up in his car smoking pot from a huge bong that converts into a travel mug.We cut back to video screens in the previously seen facility where the two middle-aged men, Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford), are watching all of this happen. Apparently, they have been drugging the kids through various means (hair dye for Jules, Marty's stash, etc.) but they don't say why.The group is close to the cabin when they stop for gas and directions. The attendant, Mordecai (Tim DeZarn), is old, unfriendly, and more than a little bit crazy.

He directs, produced and co-stars in this latest production. Not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap. But he reaches a new low when Herr Lommel works in footage from nearly his entire film catalog. I have seen film clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film). Even though he uses plenty of old footage, he works them in well (and very creatively might I add). The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. he also corresponds with a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him to try and find this wannabe Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory? Is David Hess still the man? You'll have to find out for yourself and watch the Zodiac Killer. This film is NOT about the original Zodiac killer. I have also heard people whine about this film being shot on video. So what. The director's old school artistic style outshines the fact that it's shot on video. My only complaint was the over use of stock footage from Herr Lommel's earlier films (but I understand why \\"wink\\" \\"wink\\".) Don't believe the hype. This is a gritty and street level horror film. Like the disclaimer in the beginning states, this film does nor glorify murder. You got to like that statement. Highly recommend for Ulli Lommel fans.

But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes. In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country. The National trust has its eye on a different audience at the Killerton estate in Devon. Vintage: The National Trust hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd. The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences. To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’. Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame. ‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’ Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’ The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year. Two models pose on a vintage car. The trust hopes to give off a less 'buttoned-up' impression of its properties. The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50. The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure. Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district. It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’. Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image. She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’ ‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’ The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive. This is where the organisation has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays. Highlights:","completion":"1. National Trust venues aim to attract a younger audience by hosting burlesque nights at stately homes. 2.

In that situation, you could be sued for copyright infringement. For example, you could include this covenant: “Artist covenants that he/she has the sole right to record such original songs without any restrictions whatsoever. Artist further warrants that he/she has not entered into any written, oral, or other binding agreement of any kind prior to recording such songs on behalf of the record company.” By agreeing to this provision, the artist agrees not to sue you for any misunderstandings in the agreement. Obviously, including this provision won’t entirely prevent lawsuits. However, it can be helpful to have. You might write: “Artist agrees and warrants to hold the record company ‘completely and totally harmless’ from lawsuits, and litigation of any kind whatsoever, that might proceed from any misunderstandings spelled out or not spelled out in this agreement.” You can agree to arbitrate any disputes that arise under this contract. Arbitration is like a trial except it is private. You present your case to an arbitrator instead of a judge. Alternately, you could include a provision that you will mediate any dispute with the help of a mediator. “If a disagreement does arise, then the parties have agreed in this contract to seek binding arbitration for their differences outside the bounds of a lawsuit and before an arbitration panel made up of people within the music community who understand the legal aspects of each and every facet of this agreement.” Many young artists have stars in their eyes and imagine that fame and wealth are automatically guaranteed because they have signed a recording contract. You can include some provisions which explain to the artist that the music industry is risky. For example, you could have the artist promise to the following: “The artist covenants that he/she is not basing a decision to record on any intangible or fraudulent promises, dreams, or incentives given him/her by the producers, company, or management firm. It is the reality of the music business that the artist is taking a chance at recording and may or may not ever be signed to a major label in the future.” Also, you can have the artist warrant that no one is guaranteed success: “The artist understands and warrants that no one can guarantee ‘superstardom’ in the music industry. Only a small percentage of acts signed to the major labels go on to achieve superstardom.” For extra emphasis, you can set these provisions off in bold type.

Context: My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry? Answer the above question based on the context below: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... A:","completion":"The region that supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry is the area around the Everglades in Florida. The estuaries around the Everglades create a productive ecosystem for various species, including the Tortugas pink shrimp and stone crab. Moreover, the presence of mangrove trees, which consist of red, black, and white mangroves, helps stabilize the coastline and provide a suitable habitat for various marine life, including those that are commercially harvested in Florida."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall. The majority of these farms will have runoff from their crop soil flow into the river. The Cedar is located mostly inside an unpopulated forest. Currently, not much industrialization or settling by humans has happened near The Cedar. and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Please answer this question : Will the ocean water near The Minninnippi or The Cedar have less oxygen? Answer:","completion":"The ocean water near The Minninnippi is more likely to have less oxygen as compared to the water near The Cedar, due to several factors such as agricultural runoff, livestock and human waste, and the potential for marine debris from the surrounding farmlands. The Minninnippi River flows through an area that is predominantly surrounded by farmlands. These agricultural lands often use fertilizers and chemicals to enhance crop production. When these substances come into contact with water through precipitation or irrigation, they can be carried away as runoff and make their way into the river. The presence of excess nutrients from these fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to eutrophication in the water bodies they flow into, including the ocean near the river's mouth. Eutrophication is the process through which an excessive amount of nutrients in the water leads to a rapid growth of aquatic plants and algal blooms. This, in turn, can decrease the dissolved oxygen levels in the water as the decomposition of the algae consumes oxygen. When oxygen levels become critically low, it results in hypoxia, which can lead to the creation of dead zones – areas where the oxygen concentration is too low to support most marine life. In addition to the runoff from fertilizers, the farm lands near The Minninnippi River may also contribute to the pollution of the river through livestock waste and human activities. The waste generated from these sources often contains various pollutants, including oxygen-depleting chemicals and harmful bacteria or pathogens, which contribute to further degradation of water quality. Contrastingly, The Cedar River is located mostly within an unpopulated forest, with little human or industrial interference. As a result, the river is less likely to be polluted by chemicals, waste, or debris associated with human activities. The absence of nutrient-rich runoff and pollution sources helps maintain the natural balance of dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean water near this river. To summarize, the ocean water near The Minninnippi River is expected to have less oxygen due to agricultural runoff, livestock and human waste, and the possible presence of marine debris resulting from the surrounding farmlands. On the other hand, The Cedar River, which is located in an untouched forest area, is less likely to be affected by pollution, thereby maintaining healthier oxygen levels in the adjacent ocean water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Thomas Pynchon was born in 1937 in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, one of three children of Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, Sr. (1907-1995) and Katherine Frances Bennett (1909-1996). His earliest American ancestor, William Pynchon, emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, then became the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1636, and thereafter a long line of Pynchon descendants found wealth and repute on American soil. Aspects of Pynchon's ancestry and family background have partially inspired his fiction writing, particularly in the Slothrop family histories related in the short story \\"The Secret Integration\\" (1964) and Gravity's Rainbow (1973). In an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis, with four novels in progress, announcing: \\"If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium.\\" In the mid-1960s, Pynchon lived at 217 33rd St. in Manhattan Beach, California, in a small downstairs apartment. In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from Stanley Edgar Hyman to teach literature at Bennington College, writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as \\"a moment of temporary insanity\\", but noted that he was \\"too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them.\\" Pynchon's second novel, The Crying of Lot 49, was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a \\"potboiler\\". When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it, \\"a short story, but with gland trouble\\", and hoped that Donadio could \\"unload it on some poor sucker.\\" The Crying of Lot 49 won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as \\"The Tristero\\" or \\"Trystero\\", a parody of a Jacobean revenge drama called The Courier's Tragedy, and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of World War II American GIs being used as charcoal cigarette filters. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like V., the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, with both books dwelling on the detritus of American society and culture. The Crying of Lot 49 also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of popular culture within his prose narratives. In particular, it incorporates a very direct allusion to the protagonist of Nabokov's Lolita within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of \\"The Paranoids\\", an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p. 17). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What other novels did he write?","completion":"The article doesn't provide the names of any other specific novels that Thomas Pynchon wrote, apart from \\"The Crying of Lot 49.\\" It does mention that he was working on several novels at one point, but it doesn't give their names.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart.

Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery and a supplemental food fishery. However, the wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially dead; after extensive habitat damage and overfishing, wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are farmed, predominantly from aquaculture in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia. Sport fishing communities, mainly from Iceland and Scandinavia, have joined in the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy away commercial quotas in an effort to save the wild species of Salmo salar. is there such a thing as wild atlantic salmon?","completion":"Yes, wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) do exist, but they are far less common than they once were due to factors such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and environmental changes. As you mentioned in your given information, wild Atlantic salmon comprises only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in the world fish markets, with the vast majority of the remaining 95.5% being farmed through aquaculture. Wild Atlantic salmon are native to the rivers of the North Atlantic, including those in Eastern North America, Europe, and Russia. They are anadromous, meaning they hatch in freshwater and then migrate to the ocean, where they mature before returning to freshwater environments to spawn. During these annual spawning runs, wild Atlantic salmon are targeted by recreational anglers, particularly fly fishers. Concerns regarding the sustainability of wild Atlantic salmon populations have been growing for many years. The decline in their numbers is due to a combination of factors such as overfishing, degradation of spawning and rearing habitats, pollution, introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Dams also pose a significant threat to migration routes, preventing salmon from reaching their spawning grounds, and impeding the genetic exchange between populations. Conservation groups and sport fishing communities have taken various actions to conserve and restore wild Atlantic salmon populations. One such effort is the establishment of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund (NASF), which aims to buy out commercial fishing quotas in order to save the wild species of Salmo salar. This initiative is supported by sport fishing communities predominantly from Iceland and Scandinavia, as they recognize the ecological and cultural value of wild Atlantic salmon. Restoration efforts include improving water quality, altering or removing obstructions such as dams to provide access to critical habitats, and working with communities and policymakers to reduce impacts from land development. In some regions, hatchery programs have been implemented to supplement depleted wild stocks and re-establish populations in rivers where they were historically abundant. In conclusion, there is such a thing as wild Atlantic salmon, but it is becoming increasingly rare due to multiple factors impacting their populations. Conservation and restoration efforts are ongoing to ensure the survival of this ecologically and culturally valuable species. However, much of the Atlantic salmon available to consumers today is sourced from aquaculture, as the size of the wild population cannot support large scale commercial fishing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Rookie cornerback Jason Verrett intercepted Oakland Raiders rookie quarterback Derek Carr at the San Diego 5 with 1:13 remaining in the game to seal a 31-28 Chargers win on the road. San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak. The Chargers defense forced a three-and-out, when Allen&#8212;filling in for an injured Royal&#8212;returned the punt 29 yards to the Oakland 39. With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass.

Laura fixed all of the electronics brought to them by Felicia, because","completion":"Laura fixed all of the electronics brought to them by Felicia, because she possessed a natural talent for understanding and repairing complex devices. This unique ability had been cultivated over many years, starting from her childhood, when she would take apart old gadgets and appliances to discover how they worked. Over time, she honed her skills, developing a keen eye for identifying issues and finding effective solutions. Laura's fascination with technology extended to her academic pursuits as well. She studied electrical engineering in college, further solidifying her knowledge of electronic systems and components. As a result of her extensive experience, she was well-versed in a multitude of devices, including computers, smartphones, gaming consoles, and home appliances. When Felicia approached Laura with a collection of broken electronics, she did so knowing that her friend's expertise would be of great help. Felicia had recently helped a local community center clean out their storage room, and the building's staff had discovered a variety of neglected and malfunctioning equipment. Believing that these devices could be restored and put to good use, Felicia sought Laura's assistance in assessing and repairing the items. Eager to lend a hand, Laura found reward in the challenge of restoring the abandoned electronics to their former glory. Each device required a unique approach in diagnosing and resolving its specific problems. Laura meticulously checked for damaged components, soldering joints, loose connections, and firmware issues in order to determine the best course of action. Seeing potential in repurposing these seemingly obsolete pieces of technology, Laura consulted with Felicia regarding possible applications once they were fully functional. They discussed the idea of donating the repaired items to underprivileged schools, community centers, and other institutions that could gain significant benefits from having access to updated technology. This plan to extend the life of these devices aligned with their shared belief in environmental responsibility, as it would help to combat the growing problem of e-waste and minimize the demand for new, resource-intensive products. As Laura carefully tended to each device, she also took advantage of the opportunity to impart her knowledge to Felicia. Together, they talked about common electronic failures, methods for troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance practices. Laura hoped that this experience would inspire Felicia to develop her own interest in technology and its restoration. In the end, Laura managed to repair all of the electronics brought to her by Felicia, successfully breathing new life into the devices and setting them on course for a second chance at usefulness. Their collaborative efforts not only benefited their immediate community but also highlighted the importance of making the most of available resources and nurturing one's skills to make a meaningful impact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? The Assyrian homeland or Assyria refers to a geographic and cultural region situated in Northern Mesopotamia that has been traditionally inhabited by Assyrian people. The areas that form the Assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and, more recently, northeastern Syria. Moreover, the area that had the greatest concentration of Assyrians in the world until recently, is located in the Assyrian Triangle, a region which comprises the Nineveh plains, southern Hakkari and the Barwari regions. This is where some Assyrian groups seek to create an independent nation state. During World War I the Assyrians suffered the Assyrian Genocide which reduced their numbers by up to two thirds. Subsequent to this, they entered the war on the side of the British and Russians. After World War I, the Assyrian homeland was divided between the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, which would become the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, and the French Mandate of Syria which would become the Syrian Arab Republic in 1944. Assyrians faced reprisals under the Hashemite monarchy for co-operating with the British during the years after World War I, and many fled to the West. The Patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII, though born into the line of Patriarchs at Qochanis, was educated in Britain. For a time he sought a homeland for the Assyrians in Iraq but was forced to take refuge in Cyprus in 1933, later moving to Chicago, Illinois, and finally settling near San Francisco, California. The Assyrian Chaldean Christian community was less numerous and vociferous at the time of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, and did not play a major role in the British rule of the country. However, with the exodus of Assyrian Church of the East members, the Chaldean Catholic Church became the largest non-Muslim religious denomination in Iraq, and some Assyrian Catholics later rose to power in the Ba'ath Party government, the most prominent being Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. The Assyrians of Dohuk boast one of the largest churches in the region named the Mar Marsi Cathedral, and is the center of an Eparchy. Tens of thousands of Yazidi and Assyrian Christian refugees live in the city as well due to the ISIS invasion of Iraq in 2014 and the subsequent Fall of Mosul In addition to the Assyrian population, an Aramaic speaking Jewish population existed in the region for thousands of years, living mainly in Barwari, Zakho and Alqosh. However, All of the Barwari Jews either left or were exiled to Israel shortly after its independence in 1947. The region was heavily affected by the Kurdish uprisings during the 1950s and 60s and was largely depopulated during the Al-Anfal campaign in the 1980s, although some of its population later returned and their homes were subsequently rebuilt. Assur, which is in the Saladin Governorate, was put on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in danger in 2003, at which time the site was threatened by a looming large-scale dam project that would have submerged the ancient archaeological site.

What is the answer to this question? the fibula is found in which region of the appendicular skeleton?","completion":"To answer the question, I will first need to understand the different regions of the appendicular skeleton and the location of the fibula. Step 1: Define the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs and their attachment to the axial skeleton, which are the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Step 2: Understand the regions of the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton is divided into the following regions: - The upper extremities (shoulders, arms, forearms, wrists, and hands) - The lower extremities (hips, thighs, legs, ankles, and feet) - The pectoral girdle (the bones that connect the upper limbs to the axial skeleton) - The pelvic girdle (the bones that connect the lower limbs to the axial skeleton) Step 3: Identify the location of the fibula. The fibula is one of the two bones in the lower leg, located opposite the tibia (the larger of the two bones). Together, the tibia and fibula form the connection between the knee and the ankle. Step 4: Determine the region where the fibula is found. Since the fibula is one of the bones in the lower leg, it is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton. Thus, the answer to the question is that the fibula is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose your answer from: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","completion":"(iii) no It does not follow that \\"Any real estate outside of Cape Cod in 1949 cost well above 8,000.\\" The statement that you could buy a four-room Cape Cod cottage for under 8,000 in 1949 provides information about the cost of a specific type of property in Cape Cod during that year. However, it does not provide adequate information to make a universal claim about the cost of all real estate outside of Cape Cod. Real estate prices can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, property type, market conditions, and economic trends. The cost of real estate in one area of the country may not accurately reflect or predict the cost of real estate in other locations. While it is possible that certain properties outside of Cape Cod in 1949 were priced higher than 8,000, it is also likely that many other properties were available at lower prices, depending on the location and type of property. Remember that housing prices in 1949 were also generally much lower than they are today, so a property priced well above 8,000 in today's terms may not have been considered particularly expensive at the time. To make an accurate statement about real estate prices outside Cape Cod in 1949, one would need data on property values, inflation rates, and economic trends from that time period, and compare these with similar data for other regions across the country. Furthermore, one should consider the specific types of properties being compared, as a four-room Cape Cod cottage might not be directly comparable to a larger house or a different architectural style in a different location. In conclusion, the statement about the cost of a four-room Cape Cod cottage in 1949 does not provide enough information to make a general claim about all real estate outside of Cape Cod during that time. It is essential to consider other factors and gather additional data to make a more accurate assessment of property prices and trends in different regions and time periods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 - February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews. In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with Ron Rifkin, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded All My Sons as \\"a very depressing play in a time of great optimism\\" and that positive reviews from Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times had saved it from failure. In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times. In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All My Sons. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred. did he produce another play?","completion":"Yes, Arthur Miller continued to produce plays after Death of a Salesman. Some of his notable works include The Crucible (1953), which is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the Salem witch trials, and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956), a tragedy set in an Italian-American community in Brooklyn.

A:","completion":"Guru Dutt, born Vasanth Kumar Shivashankarpe on July 9, 1925, was a multifaceted Indian artist known for his contribution to the Indian film industry as an actor, producer, director, and choreographer. He took birth in Bangalore, British India, in a culturally rich family that played a significant role in shaping his love for arts. Dutt kickstarted his career in the Indian film industry in 1944 when he was just 19 years old. Over a span of two decades, he worked with immense dedication and showcased his expertise in a variety of roles across the cinematic world. With his unique artistic prowess, Dutt made a significant impact on Indian cinema, particularly during its golden era. Guru Dutt's directorial ventures were well-known for their artistic sensibilities, strong storylines, and a distinct visual style that set them apart from other films of that era. His movies, such as “Pyaasa” (1957) and “Kaagaz Ke Phool” (1959), are still considered classics that greatly influenced subsequent generations of filmmakers. Apart from being a filmmaker, Guru Dutt was also a talented actor who captivated audiences with his powerful performances. He remained deeply committed to his craft, earning critical acclaim and widespread admiration for his work in films like “Baazi” (1951) and “Jaal” (1952). In his personal life, Guru Dutt was married to playback singer and actress Geeta Dutt (née Roy) from 1953 until his untimely death in 1964. The couple had three children together. Geeta Dutt, an accomplished artist in her own right, lent her voice to many iconic songs in Hindi cinema, further elevating their status as a power couple of that time. Unfortunately, Guru Dutt's life was marred by personal struggles and a tragic end. He passed away on October 10, 1964, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, under mysterious circumstances. Despite his relatively short-lived career, Guru Dutt's extraordinary body of work has left an indelible mark on Indian cinema. Today, Guru Dutt is celebrated as one of the most influential and iconic figures in the history of Indian cinema. With a career that spanned 20 years, he contributed massively to the evolution of Indian films, inspiring future generations of filmmakers to push the boundaries of storytelling and explore new avenues in the world of cinema. His legacy continues to be revered by film enthusiasts, critics, and artists around the globe."},{"prompt":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Nitrogen is a diatomic element with five valence electrons.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed.

Here are the options: Options are: (I) yes; (II) it is not possible to tell; (III) no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their main components and analyze them step by step. Step 1: Identify the components of the premise Premise: These are terrible ideas (to find out why), but without them, the notion is simply empty. Components: 1. These ideas are terrible. 2. Without these ideas, the notion is empty. Step 2: Identify the components of the hypothesis Hypothesis: These ideas are not good but are needed. Components: 1. These ideas are not good. 2. These ideas are needed. Step 3: Compare the components Now, let's compare the components of the premise and hypothesis to see if the first supports the second. 1. Ideas being terrible vs. Ideas being not good - Both the premise and hypothesis agree that these ideas have negative qualities. 2. Without the ideas, the notion is empty vs. The ideas are needed - The premise states that without these ideas, the notion lacks substance or meaning, making it \\"empty\\". The hypothesis states that these ideas are necessary or required. In both cases, there's an underlying sentiment that these ideas play a crucial role despite their negative qualities. Step 4: Assess the relationship between premise and hypothesis Based on the comparison in Step 3, we can see that the components of the premise align with those of the hypothesis. Terrible ideas in the premise are equivalent to not good ideas in the hypothesis, and the notion being empty without them corresponds to the idea's necessity. Conclusion: Given the similarities between the components of the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson,...

The steps to solve the equation are as follows: Step 1: Combine the constants. 0 = -1360*w - (57849 + 29191) Add the numbers 57849 and 29191 to get the sum: 0 = -1360*w - 87040 Step 2: Isolate the w term To do this, we need to get rid of the -87040 and -1360 terms on the right-hand side of the equation. First, we move the -87040 constant to the left-hand side by adding 87040 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 87040 = -1360*w - 87040 + 87040 87040 = -1360*w Step 3: Solve for w Now that we have the equation 87040 = -1360*w, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by -1360. 87040 / -1360 = (-1360*w) / -1360 Which simplifies to: -64 = w So the solution to the given equation is w = -64."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The name \\"Dallas\\" came from his love of the Dallas Cowboys. His brother, Rory, and sister, Sally, were raised by their maternal grandmother. When WCW was purchased by WWF owner Vince McMahon in 2001, Page was one of the few major WCW stars (along with Booker T and Buff Bagwell) who accepted buyouts of their AOL Time Warner contracts in order to immediately sign with McMahon. He debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on the edition of June 18, 2001 of Raw when he unveiled himself as the stalker of The Undertaker's wife, Sara. Page revealed he didn't care about Sara; he only did it to make an impact and wanted to take on the biggest dog in the yard. Page soon joined the Alliance during the WCW Invasion. At King of the Ring, he fought The Undertaker in an unsanctioned brawl that was never announced as an official match. Page and Chris Kanyon reunited on the edition of August 6, 2001 of Raw when Kanyon helped Page attack The Undertaker backstage. Three days later on edition of August 9, 2001 of SmackDown!, Page and Kanyon defeated the APA to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a breakdown of how government buying meat for everyone affects the steps in the process mentioned: 1. When the government buys meat for everyone, it increases the demand for meat. 2. To meet this demand, meat production has to increase, which leads to an increase in livestock farming. 3. Livestock farming, particularly cattle farming, is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, through their digestive processes, and their manure also emits greenhouse gases. 4. Increased greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from livestock, will contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 5. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has the effect of trapping more heat from the Sun. 6. Different things on Earth will experience increased temperatures as a result of the trapped heat, leading to an overall increase in the planet's temperature, a phenomenon known as global warming. So, in this scenario, increasing meat production due to the government buying meat for everyone indirectly impacts the process by contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn traps more heat and leads to a hotter planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

She is kidnapped by his older brother Miles and brought back to the Tucks' home where they tell her they'll return her as soon as they can trust her. She becomes enamored of their slow and simple way of life and falls in love with Jesse. She learns that the Tucks cannot age or be injured due to drinking water from a magic spring around a hundred years ago and that they kidnapped her to hide the secret. They tell her that living forever is more painful than it sounds and believe that giving away the secret of the spring will lead to everyone wanting to drink from it.

In fact, despite demonstrations and a slew of online petitions (like this, this, and this) aimed at getting Nestlé to stop what it's doing, the company would, in a perfect world, boost the 700 million gallons of water it now uses. \\"If I could increase it, I would,\\" says Tim Brown, who heads Nestlé Waters North America, in an interview with radio station KPCC. \\"The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water. We feel good about what we're doing, delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California,\\" he said, per the Guardian. (In the same interview, NASA JPL's top water scientist points out that bottling water requires as much as 50% more water than turning on the tap.) Brown says Nestlé wastes some 30% of the groundwater it draws from the state, but the company this week announced plans to cut that figure by 12% at its Bakersfield and Tulare bottling facilities—two of five in the state—for a savings of 26 million gallons. That isn't nearly enough to help combat \\"the worst drought we've seen in a long time,\\" says charity Food & Water Watch. \\"It's irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that's supposed to be a public resource,\\" a rep says. \\"We're calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.\\" In an editorial for the San Bernardino County Sun in late April, Brown argued that \\"bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought\\" and noted that the 700 million gallons Nestlé uses \\"is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses.\\" (Another big company is similarly under fire.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Sure, let's break this down into smaller bits. The company Starbucks was under a lot of pressure because they were taking water from California, which doesn't have a lot of it, to put in their bottled water. They eventually stopped doing that. However, Nestlé, another company that does the same thing, has said that they won't stop. Even though a lot of people are really upset with Nestlé and want them to stop taking California's water, the head of Nestlé's water business in North America, Tim Brown, said that they would even like to take more if they could. He said that even if Nestlé stop selling bottled water, people would start buying from another brand. He believes that they are doing good by providing a healthy drink to people. On the other hand, a top water scientist from NASA JPL explained that putting water in bottles uses up to 50% more water than just getting water from a tap. Right now, out of all the water they take from the ground, about 30% of it goes to waste. But Nestlé has announced that they want to improve that by wasting 12% less water at two of their five factories in California. They say this will save 26 million gallons of water. But some people, like a group called Food & Water Watch, say that this isn't enough. They say that California is in a really bad drought, which means there's a lot less water than normal. Because of this, they think it's wrong for Nestlé to be taking water that should be for everyone and putting it in bottles to sell it. They want to stop companies from selling bottled water for profit. In response to this, Tim Brown wrote that bottled water is not the cause of the drought. He said that the amount of water Nestlé uses is about the same as what two golf courses in California would use in a year.

The discussion centered around the allegations of corruption and mismanagement connected with the program. The Oil-for-Food program was established by the United Nations in 1995 as a humanitarian effort aimed at providing much-needed resources to Iraq's civilian population, who were suffering the detrimental effects of economic sanctions imposed on Saddam Hussein's regime by the UN. Under the program, Iraq was permitted to export limited amounts of oil in return for food, medicine, and other essential items to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi citizens. Despite its noble intentions, the Oil-for-Food program soon became marred by widespread claims of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement. Allegations of improprieties included individuals and companies throughout the world who had allegedly manipulated the program for personal or political gain. In response to these claims, the United Nations tasked an independent team of investigators with the responsibility of examining and addressing the allegations to determine the extent of the corruption within the program. Kofi Annan, who was the UN Secretary-General during the time the Oil-for-Food program was operational, recently met with the chief investigator to lend his support and assistance to the ongoing probe. Annan expressed his commitment to ensuring a thorough and impartial examination of the program, given its critical importance to the credibility and reputation of the United Nations. \\"I have pledged my wholehearted support and cooperation to this investigation,\\" Annan said during the meeting with the investigator. \\"The United Nations must be beyond reproach in its conduct, and I encourage all parties involved to be completely transparent and forthcoming with information.\\" Annan's meeting with the chief investigator signifies a dedication to uncovering the truth behind the extensive corruption allegations surrounding the Oil-for-Food program. In addition to the individual charges of fraud and mismanagement, the scandal has also raised questions about systemic weaknesses within the United Nations that may have allowed for the corruption to take place. As the investigation enters its next phase, the chief investigator and his team intend to leverage the insights gained from their discussion with Annan to add context, nuance, and clarity to their ongoing assessment of the Oil-for-Food program. The comprehensive nature of their probe will encompass not only the individual actors implicated in the scandal but also the underlying structural problems that could have contributed to the program's widespread exploitation. Ultimately, it is hoped that the investigative team's diligent work will lay the foundation for much-needed reforms within the United Nations while ensuring that the organization remains a highly-regarded and essential force for good in the world. In conclusion, the meeting between Kofi Annan and the chief investigator of the Oil-for-Food program strongly emphasizes the importance of transparency, impartiality, and comprehensive assessment in addressing the allegations of corruption surrounding the program. As the investigation continues, it is key that the United Nations learns from this situation by identifying and rectifying any structural weaknesses that were exploited in the Oil-for-Food scandal to preserve the organization's credibility and integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: In 1979, the Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commencing on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK programming. What is the answer to this question: Who first developed consumer HD television with a 5:3 aspect ratio?","completion":"The Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio. This breakthrough occurred in 1979 and represented a significant advancement in television technology. The system they developed was known as Hi-Vision or MUSE, which stands for Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding. This moniker refers to the method that was used to encode the broadcast signal. NHK's Hi-Vision or MUSE system was innovative and ground-breaking in terms of its technical specifications. It required about twice the bandwidth of the previous NTSC system, which was the standard at the time. Despite requiring a higher amount of bandwidth, the MUSE system was able to deliver a vastly superior resolution. Specifically, it provided about four times the resolution of the NTSC system, with 1080 interlaced lines, or 1125 lines in total. The development and implementation of this system was a methodical process. Satellite test broadcasts of this new high-definition format began about ten years later, in 1989. After these preliminary tests, a more regular testing schedule was initiated in 1991. The results of this period of extensive testing culminated in the start of regular broadcasting of BS-9ch on November 25, 1994. BS-9ch broadcast included both commercial programming and programming produced by NHK. So in summary, the seminal development of consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio was first undertaken by the Japanese state broadcaster NHK in 1979. This system was a significant leap forward in televisual technology, providing much higher resolution and enhanced picture quality compared to existing systems, albeit at the cost of requiring a higher bandwidth for transmission."},{"prompt":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: GREAT !!!!!

Like so many gyms, Anytime really exists to get you to purchase the personal training. They give you a free session (which was really a pretty brief, weak session), and then try to get you to sign up for personalized training. I can't afford personalized training. Hell, I can barely afford the monthly membership. Before I had the meeting about the personalized training, they were really happy to see me every time I walked in. Someone from the staff made sure to come say hi to me every time I worked out. About a week later, after they ran their spiel and I turned them down, it was like I turned into a ghost. I'm not complaining; I'm glad they don't bother me anymore, but they shut down hardcore. I see the staff talk to some of the people there, but most of us just go about our sessions as if they can't see us. I've been a member for close to two years now. Not one staff member has even said so much as hello to me since I turned down their services. I'm okay with that, like I said, but it's going to get interesting in a month and a half when my membership needs to be renewed. I wonder if they're going to pretend to be my best friends again. I can usually get an elliptical, treadmill, or exercise bike when I go in.

Reports from Croatia indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog populations.

Write a summary based on this article: 60 Minutes's interview with Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of Apple founder and former CEO Steve Jobs, aired on CBS News around the U.S. at 7 p.m. local time Sunday evening. The segment appeared two-and-a-half weeks after Jobs's passing, and less than 24 hours before Isaacson's biography hits bookshelves. Excerpts of the biography, which contains information derived from interviews with more than 100 individuals among his acquaintance, as well as some 40 interviews with Jobs himself, have already appeared at many media outlets. Below, we've identified some highlights from the transcript of Sunday evening's segment. You can watch the segment in full here. Jobs invited Isaacson to write his biography seven years ago. Isaacson thought the request \\"presumptuous and premature, since Jobs was still a young man.\\" What Isaacson didn't know at the time was that Jobs was about to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer. Isaacson describes Jobs as \\"petulant\\" and \\"brittle.\\" \\"He could be very, very mean to people at times. Whether it was to a waitress in a restaurant, or to a guy who had stayed up all night coding. … And you'd say, 'Why did you do that? Why weren't you nicer?' And he'd say, 'I really want to be with people who demand perfection. And this is who I am,\\" recalls Isaacson. Isaacson attributes much of Jobs's personality and drive to a few key moments in his childhood. Isaacson tells one anecdote involving the construction of a fence with his adoptive father Paul. \\"And [Paul] said, 'You got to make the back of the fence that nobody will see just as good looking as the front of the fence. Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you're dedicated to making something perfect.'\\" Jobs was also influenced by the Bay Area, and not just the Hewlett-Packard offices located nearby, but also its counter-culture spirit. \\"He was sort of a hippie-ish rebel kid, loved listening to Dylan music, dropped acid, but also he loved electronics,\\" Isaacson describes. He says that when Jobs worked at game-maker Atari they had to put him on the night shift because he walked around barefoot and never bathed, and so employees didn't want to work with him. Jobs took a seven-month leave from Atari to travel through India. His encounters there and with Zen Buddhism \\"really informed his design sense,\\" says Isaacson. \\"That notion that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication [came from that trip].\\" When Jobs returned, he began making a primitive computer for hobbyists in the garage of his parents with Steve Wozniak, Apple's other founder. They started with 1,300. By the time Jobs was 25 Apple was worth \\"maybe 50 million dollars,\\" Jobs said in a taped recording with Isaacson. \\"I knew I never had to worry about money again.\\" Jobs also had a natural disregard for authority, and felt that normal rules didn't apply to him, Isaacson explains. One manifestation of that principle was visible in a Mercedes sports coupe he owned, which he refused to put a license plate on. Isaacson says Jobs's house in Palo Alto is completely unremarkable. \\"[It's] a house on a normal street with a normal sidewalk. No big winding driveway. No big security fences,\\" Isaacson says. He recalls that Jobs said he \\"did not want to live that nutso lavish lifestyle that so many people do when they get rich.\\" Jobs did meet his biological father, who once ran a restaurant in Silicon Valley. But Jobs never revealed to his father who he was. \\"I was in that restaurant once or twice and I remember meeting the owner who was from Syria,\\" Jobs said on tape. \\"And it was most certainly [my father]. And I shook his hand and he shook my hand. And that’s all.\\" Jobs's cancer was discovered accidentally while he was being checked for kidney stones in 2004. A cat scan revealed a malignant tumor in his pancreas. Jobs delayed the operation for its removal for nine months while he tried a number of natural remedies first. By the time it was operated on, the cancer had spread to tissues around the pancreas. Isaacson says he believes Jobs regretted the delay. Through 2008, Jobs continued to receive secret cancer treatment even though he was telling everyone he had been cured. The cancer had spread to his liver by this time. In the last two-and-a-half years of his life, Jobs no longer wanted to go out or travel, but wanted to focus on the products he was building at Apple: namely, the iPhone and iPad. \\"I think he would've loved to have conquered television [as well],\\" says Isaacson. \\"He would love to make an easy-to-use television set. … But he started focusing on his family again as well. And it was a painful brutal struggle. And he would talk, often to me about the pain.\\" Jobs occasionally brought up the subject of death in their last meetings. \\"I saw my life as an arc and that it would end and compared to that nothing mattered,\\" Jobs said in a taped interview. \\"You’re born alone, you’re going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean what is it exactly is it that you have to lose Steve? You know? There’s nothing.\\" ||||| Steve Jobs: Revelations from a tech giant Steve Jobs was already gravely ill with cancer when he asked author Walter Isaacson to write his biography. Jobs told Isaacson to write a honest book - about his failings and his strengths. Steve Kroft reports. (CBS News) His products - the Mac, iPhone, iPad and others - forever changed the way we think about technology. But how should we think about the man behind them, Apple's hard-driving co-founder Steve Jobs? In the years before his death, Jobs granted biographer Walter Isaacson more than 40 interviews, many recorded on tape. The result, as Steve Kroft reveals in this two-part story, is a rich portrait of an extraordinary innovator, whose outsized talents were matched by very human limitations. The following script is from \\"Steve Jobs\\" which aired on Oct. 23, 2011. Seven years ago, Steve Jobs asked Walter Isaacson, a former editor of TIME Magazine, if he would write his biography. Isaacson, who has done books about Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein, thought the request presumptuous and premature, since Jobs was still a young man. What Isaacson didn't know at the time, and only a few people did, was that Jobs was about to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer and was feeling his mortality. It speaks to the secrecy with which Jobs conducted his life and his business, adding mystery to an already compelling figure. \\"60 Minutes\\" coverage: Steve Jobs Complete coverage: Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011 In 2009, with Jobs already gravely ill, Isaacson began the first of more than 40 interviews with him - the last was conducted a few weeks before his death. Some of them were tape recorded and you will hear parts of them tonight. \\"I have no skeletons in my closet that can't be allowed out,\\" Jobs said. And like a well-timed Apple launch, the book titled simply - \\"Steve Jobs\\" - will be in stores tomorrow just two-and-a-half weeks after he died. \\"60 Minutes Overtime\\": Steve Jobs: Family photo album \\"60 Minutes Overtime\\": What did Steve Jobs say about his rivals? When Walter Isaacson first began working on the book, which is published by Simon and Schuster, a division of CBS, Steve Jobs' wife, Laurene Powell, told him, \\"Be honest with his failings as well as his strengths. There are parts of his life and his personality that are extremely messy. You shouldn't whitewash it. I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully.\\" Walter Isaacson: He's not warm and fuzzy. And to do it, Isaacson interviewed more than 100 people - Jobs' friends, family, co-workers and competitors. Steve Kroft: I think it's a tough book. Isaacson: It's a book that's fair. I mean, this is a real human being. Kroft: He had lots of flaws. Isaacson: He was very petulant. He was very brittle. He could be very, very mean to people at times. Whether it was to a waitress in a restaurant, or to a guy who had stayed up all night coding, he could just really just go at them and say, \\"You're doin' this all wrong. It's horrible.\\" And you'd say, \\"Why did you do that? Why weren't you nicer?\\" And he'd say, \\"I really wanna be with people who demand perfection. And this is who I am.\\" Isaacson believes that much of it can be traced to the earliest years of his life, and to the fact that Jobs was born out of wedlock, given up by his birth parents, and adopted by a working class couple from Mountain View, California. Isaacson: Paul Jobs was a salt-of-the-earth guy who was a great mechanic. And he taught his son Steve how to make great things. And he--once they were building a fence. And he said, \\"You got to make the back of the fence that nobody will see just as good looking as the front of the fence. Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you're dedicated to making something perfect.\\" Jobs always knew he was adopted, but it still had a profound effect on him. He told Isaacson this story from his early childhood during one of their many taped interviews: [Steve Jobs, audio: I was, I remember right here on the lawn, telling Lisa McMoylar from across the street that I was adopted. And she said, \\"So does that mean your real parents didn't want you?\\" Ooooh, lightning bolts went off in my head. I remember running into the house, I think I was like crying, asking my parents. And they sat me down and they said, \\"No, you don't understand. We specifically picked you out.\\"] ||||| Summary:","completion":"The CBS News's 60 Minutes interview conducted with Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of Steve Jobs, provided a multifaceted view of Jobs's life, personality, and career. The conversation transpired seven years after Jobs invited Isaacson to write his biography. Isaacson initially thought Jobs's request as premature, given that Jobs was still in his prime. It was only later that Isaacson found out that Jobs was suffering from pancreatic cancer at the time. Isaacson characterizes Jobs as 'petulant' and 'brittle', whose harsh treatment of others was rooted in his quest for perfection. Many factors contributed to Jobs's drive and character, including his upbringing with his adoptive parents, the influence of the Bay Area's counter-culture, and foundational experiences like his time in India, where Isaacson believes Jobs developed a deep appreciation for simplicity. Jobs's entrepreneurial journey started in his parent's garage, where he and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak began building primitive computers for hobbyists. By the time Jobs was 25, Apple had already reached a valuation of approximately 50 million. Isaacson also noted Jobs's disregard for norms and rules, one instance of which includes his refusal to install a license plate on his Mercedes sports coupe. His personal life, exemplified by his ordinary house in Palo Alto and his unflashy lifestyle, contrasted starkly with his professional success. Several personal revelations were also touched on in the interview. Jobs met his Syrian biological father who ran a restaurant in Silicon Valley but never revealed his identity. His battle with cancer, accidentally discovered in 2004, significantly influenced the final years of his life. Jobs delayed surgery for almost nine months, opting to try natural remedies first, which led to the cancer spreading to surrounding tissues. This period was also marked by Jobs focusing more on his family, while also concentrating on key Apple products like the iPhone and iPad. In a broader profound reflection, Jobs expressed his philosophical feelings toward the end of his life. On his views about mortality, Jobs said \\"You're born alone, you're going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean what is it exactly is it that you have to lose Steve? You know? There's nothing.\\" His story is a blend of extraordinary innovation, significant human limitations, and lessons about life and death."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. I am facing a new situation today: Pat and Tammy are mother and sister. They like to take long walks together.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? National Front parade bugler Allen Boyce, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. Nigel Farage said the money would be given to charity Ukip faced a new race row last night over a £28,000 gift from a pensioner branded ‘evil’ by a judge for giving a bomb-making recipe to a man who attacked immigrants’ homes, writes Simon Walters. Allen Boyce received a two-year suspended jail sentence for handing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist who was jailed for a race-hate campaign against Asian families in Eastbourne. Details of political donations published last week show that Boyce, a National Front parade bugler, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. He told OPTIONS: - Allen Boyce how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Asian how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - BNP how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Boyce how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - British National Party how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Eastbourne how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - National Front how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Nigel Farage how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Simon Walters how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Ukip how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived.","completion":"He told Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. This revelation raises questions about the legitimacy of Boyce's donation to Ukip, as his actions had led to significant harm and fear within the immigrant community. His involvement in providing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist like Collins, who actively pursued a campaign against Asian families, highlights his connection to extremist far-right ideologies. Considering the judge's branding of Boyce as \\"evil,\\" it is crucial for Ukip to carefully consider the implications of accepting and utilizing the £28,416 left by Boyce. Nigel Farage has already stated that the money would be given to charity. However, Ukip must ensure that the charity or cause receiving these funds is appropriate and promotes compassion, inclusivity, and community-building, as an effort to counteract the damage done by Boyce's actions. In taking these steps, Ukip can demonstrate that they do not support individuals like Boyce and are dedicated to promoting an inclusive society. Furthermore, by transparently reporting on the allocation of Boyce's donation, Ukip can also build trust with the public and showcase accountability in their political and financial dealings. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the passage considers Terry Collins as the recipient of Boyce's instructions. This reveals the severity of Boyce's actions and the importance of Ukip's responsibility to handle the donation ethically and transparently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In life , the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by the physical senses of pleasure , pain , sight and sound . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"These two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other to an extent, but they convey slightly different ideas and emphasis when compared. Let's break down each sentence to understand the subtle differences. Sentence 1: \\"In life , the bodily functions of the soul are restricted by rational and intelligent senses of pleasure , pain , sight , and sound .\\" This sentence suggests that the soul possesses bodily functions that are limited by the rational and intelligent dimensions of our senses, including pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. The focus here is on the bodily functions of the soul being confined due to these higher cognitive aspects of our senses. Sentence 2: \\"In life , the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by the physical senses of pleasure , pain , sight and sound .\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the rational and intelligent functions of the soul, which are portrayed as being limited by the physical aspects of our senses, including pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. The emphasis here is on the higher cognitive aspects of the soul being held back by the physical nature of the senses. While both sentences describe limitations imposed on the soul by the interaction between the senses and the soul, the first sentence highlights the restriction of soul's bodily functions due to the rational and intelligent aspects of our senses. The second sentence emphasizes the restriction of the soul's rational and intelligent functions due to the physical aspects of our senses. In summary, these sentences can be seen as paraphrases in the sense that they both explore the limitations of the soul and its functions related to senses. However, the way they emphasize different aspects of the soul's functions and the senses is what sets them apart, making them not entirely equivalent in their meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Papal conclave of October 1978 was triggered by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign for at least a decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtya, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name of \\"John Paul II\\". - Karol : A Man Who Became Pope ( pl : Karol - Czowiek , który zosta Papieem , it : Karol , un uomo diventato Papa ) is a 2005 TV miniseries directed by Giacomo Battiato , and created as a Polish - Italian - French - German and Canadian joint cooperation project . Karol is a biography of Karol Wojtya , later known as Pope John Paul II , beginning in 1939 when Karol was only 19 years old and ending at the Papal conclave , October 1978 that made him Pope . The TV miniseries was supposed to première at the very beginning of April 2005 in the Vatican , but it was delayed due to the Pope 's death . It was broadcast for the first time by the Italian television station Canale 5 on the first day of the 2005 papal election . Although it was originally broadcast on television , it was also released in theaters , which allowed the film to be shown in Poland . The incredible success of the movie prompted the creation of a sequel , Karol : The Pope , The Man ( 2006 ) , which portrayed Karol 's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death . - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani (17 October 191228 September 1978), served as Pope from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later. His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, ending a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. He was declared a Servant of God by his successor, Pope John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope. The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years, and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'filming location'.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.

Do this even if you already have antivirus software, as the software on your computer may be infected. Once you’ve chosen a virus removal tool, download it to your desktop. Most companies that sell antivirus software also offer free virus removal tools. Some options besides Microsoft’s own are Kaspersky Free Virus Scan and Sophos Virus Removal Tool. If you can’t use a web browser on the infected computer, use a different computer to download a virus removal tool, then burn it to a CD or DVD. Insert the burned disc into the infected machine, press ⊞ Win+E to launch File Explorer, then double-click your DVD-ROM drive to find the tool. Worms and other malware can hide in the System Restore files, which may hide them from virus removal tools. You should turn off System Restore before running the removal tool to prevent this from happening. Windows 7 and Vista users should type “protection” into the search box instead, then click “System protection.” ” This works on any Windows version. If you have a separate antivirus program like McAfee or Kaspersky, open it and find the “settings” or “options” area, then find an option for “disable” or “turn off.” Once the program is disabled, you’ll probably see a message that says your computer is at risk. You can ignore it for now as you’ll be restoring it soon. The computer will then reboot into the Chose an Option screen. This begins the process of booting into Safe Mode on a Windows 8 or 10 computer. To access Safe Mode on Windows 7 or Vista: Reboot the computer and tap the F8 key repeatedly as it restarts until you arrive at the Boot Options screen. ” In Windows 7, use the arrow keys to select “Safe Mode with Networking,” then press ↵ Enter to boot into that mode. You are now in safe mode and can skip the next few steps intended for Windows 10/8 users. ” The computer will reboot a second time. Or, if you inserted a CD/DVD that contains the tool, double-click the tool to open it. The scan will take at least several minutes to complete. Depending on the computer, software, and infection level, this may take over an hour. Once the virus scan is complete, the antivirus tool will report its results. If you see prompts to “quarantine” (another term for safely removing the malware from your PC), follow them so that the files are properly destroyed. Some programs, such as Microsoft’s Malicious Software Removal Tool, will remove the malware/worms without your intervention. If nothing is found, it’s very likely that you don't have a worm virus. If you still think you may be infected, try one of the other virus-removal tools. ” The computer will reboot normally, without a worm infection. Don't skip this step! To allow Windows to create automatic restore points for emergency use, return to the System Restore (called \\"System Protection\\" in Windows Vista and 7) dialog and check “Turn on system protection”.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does Sid's neighboring miner have to give up after being arrested? ? The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women. - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\" - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death. - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\" - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream . - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.

Please briefly summarize this news article: With i3 Electric Car, BMW Tries to Ease Range Anxiety FÃRSTENFELDBRÃCK, Germany â Since BMW began the slow debut of its battery-powered car more than two years ago, the engineers from Bavaria promised that the i3 would be as fun to drive as a conventional BMW. What if it was even more fun to drive? BMW has bet considerable resources that the cost advantages of operating an electric car will outweigh the one big disadvantage â range. BMW says the i3, which will come to market in Europe in November and the United States next year, can travel 186 miles when equipped with an optional range extender, a motorcyclelike gasoline engine that helps maintain the charge when the car runs low. Otherwise, the car will be able to travel about half that distance, or about 93 miles, on a single charge. The new car the company showed automobile writers on Monday at a former military airfield outside Munich had the pep and agility drivers have come to expect from BMW sedans â though not necessarily that of the Z sports cars or M series muscle cars. The i3 has some bonus features, like a quiet ride and a power recovery system that reduces the need to use the brakes since letting up on the accelerator quickly slows the car. Executives hope the i3 will decisively persuade consumers to accept electric cars. âWe are at the dawn of a new era,â Ian Robertson, BMWâs head of sales, told reporters on Monday. BMW executives insist that going 186 miles between plug-in charges â they take less than an hour at special stations and six to eight hours from a wall socket at home â is enough range for people living in urban or suburban areas. Extensive trial projects with electrified Minis and 1 Series cars showed that Americans typically drove less than 40 miles a day. In power-saving mode, which turns down the air-conditioning and other power-hungry functions, the i3âs range is about 120 miles. Perhaps mindful of forecasts by rival electric carmakers that proved overly optimistic, Mr. Robertson declined to name sales targets for the i3. BMW plans simultaneous public introductions of the i3, which has begun production at BMWâs factory in Leipzig, Germany, at the end of July in New York, London and Beijing. The company has not yet revealed the price for the i3 or any of its options, but it is likely to be well under 40,000. Despite a price that will probably be somewhat higher than a conventional 3 Series sedan, the i3 brings some cost advantages. The i3 never needs an oil change and a power recovery system, which slows the car automatically, means the brakes should last much longer than in a conventional car. There are far fewer moving parts to wear out. A full charge should cost well under 10 depending on local power costs, a particularly large advantage in Europe. One reason that electric cars have not been a hit with buyers is that people perceive them as being much more expensive, with more limited range, and no obvious advantages over cars that rely on gasoline or diesel fuel. So far, not many buyers have been willing to pay much extra for the right to feel good about driving a car that is free of emissions from a gasoline engine. An electric car gives more options to engineers in placing components that drive the car and optimizing weight distribution. In the i3, BMW engineers put the batteries under the passenger compartment in a rectangular aluminum box roughly the size of a double bed. The electric motor is mounted above the rear wheels. The passenger compartment is made largely of lightweight carbon fiber. The effect is a low center of gravity and even distribution of weight between the front and rear axles. So even though the i3 has the upright profile of a hatchback and stands notably taller than a BMW Mini or 3 Series sedan, it feels remarkably stable slaloming around pylons or negotiating a tight curve at high speed. At the same time, the i3 has a smaller turning radius than a Mini, giving it greater maneuverability in the urban environments for which it is intended. BMW is going to great lengths to alleviate range anxiety. A display in the car will show the location of nearby recharging stations. BMW will also offer a roadside assistance program in areas where sales justify it. Instead of a tow, the assistance vehicle will provide a charge so the i3 can travel to the next charging station. Mr. Robertson said he expected the i3 to be a second car for most buyers. But for customers who might occasionally want to drive long distances, BMW will offer packages allowing them occasional loans of gasoline or diesel-powered BMW models. Even if the i3 is a flop, BMW expects to earn a return on its investment. It is already working on hybrid cars that will use the same aluminum and carbon body architecture. For the time being, Mr. Robertson said, BMW plans to be âa significant playerâ in the market for electric cars, which he put at 150,000 vehicles a year. True mass acceptance, he said, will come when electric cars cost less than 10 percent more than a conventional vehicle and can travel at least 186 miles on a battery charge. âBattery technology will develop more in the next five years than in the last 100 years,â he said. Summary:","completion":"BMW is attempting to ease range anxiety with its i3 electric car, set to launch in Europe in November and the US next year. With an optional range extender equipped, the i3 can travel 186 miles, which BMW says is sufficient for urban and suburban living. The vehicle also includes convenient features such as a quiet ride and a power recovery system that reduces the need for brakes. With the i3, BMW hopes to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and become a significant player in the emerging market."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Authorities in northeast Texas were assessing damage Monday morning after a tornado destroyed homes, knocked train cars off their tracks and injured at least four people. Five homes in Rice, Texas, were destroyed as 125 mph winds whipped through a seven-mile swath of Navarro County Sunday evening, said Eric Meyers, the county's emergency management coordinator. Meyers rode out the tornado inside a vehicle and videotaped the twister as it tore the roof off a school about a block away. \\"We are in the tornado! We are in the tornado!\\" Meyers yells several times in the video. \\"The sheer power was just amazing,\\" Meyers said in an interview Monday on CNN's \\"American Morning\\" program. The storm, which struck around 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), also turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car, knocked 11 cars from a freight train off their tracks and caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School, Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. Video: 'People screamed, cried, and prayed' as tornado passed. Four people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, he said. In addition to \\"significant damage\\" from the storm moving through Navarro County, witnesses also reported possible tornadoes in other parts of northeast Texas Sunday evening, the National Weather Service said. Callers reported four tornadoes in Lone Oak, Texas, Fire Chief Chris Moore said, but authorities had not yet confirmed whether a twister had touched down there. The storm destroyed one home, damaged three others and knocked down power lines there, Moore said. Authorities called off a youth football game as winds picked up speed and hail pelted the county, he said. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos. Sonia Butler hunkered down in the bathroom of her Rice home with her brother as the storm hit. \\"You could just hear the wind coming through the house and it felt like a big suction,\\" she told CNN affiliate WFAA. \\"And then it sounded like a loud train, and it only lasted -- not very long, but after that, after we came out of the restroom, our house was just gone.\\" Her husband, Raymond Butler, sought shelter in another part of the home as the storm hit. The room he stayed in remained untouched, but the storm demolished most of their home, ripping off the roof, shattering light bulbs and breaking their deceased daughter's track trophies. The storm also destroyed two trucks, a trailer, and a giant pecan tree on the property -- but it spared the grave of their daughter, who died last year. \\"I just got down on my knees and said, 'Lord be with us,' \\" Raymond Butler told WFAA. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. \\"We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,\\" he said. Someone screamed when they saw a funnel forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. \\"The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening. ... We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,\\" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. \\"Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,\\" he said. Later Sunday, a possible tornado swept through Baldwin County, Alabama, knocking down power lines and tree branches, destroying a mobile home and shifting another mobile home off its foundation, said Leigh Ann Ryals with the county's Emergency Operations Center. One person was injured, Ryals said, and crews planned to continue surveying damage Monday. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jessica Jordan, Rick Martin and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about a big tornado that caused a lot of damage in northeast Texas. Imagine a super strong wind that can blow houses away just like your toy blocks. This tornado was so strong it even knocked train cars off their tracks and hurt four people. It destroyed or damaged several homes, and even damaged a school. You know how scary and loud a train can be? That's how scary and loud this tornado sounded. One family, the Butlers, had to hide in their bathroom when the tornado came, and when they came out, most of their house was gone. There were big chunks of ice, called hail, falling from the sky that were as big as baseballs. It was so scary that people screamed when they saw the wind blowing in the shape of a funnel, which is what a tornado looks like. Even though lots of things were destroyed, everyone worked together to help each other. For example, a man named Joey helped to treat people who were hurt, even though he had to hide in a cold freezer during the storm. This is why it's so important to listen to weather warnings and why we do drills at school to practice what to do in a tornado."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information: - Dionysius of Halicarnassus (\\"Dionysos Alexandrou Alikarnasseus\\"; \\"\\"Dionysios son of Alexandros of Halikarnassos\\"\\"; c. 60 BCafter 7 BC) was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, who flourished during the reign of Caesar Augustus. His literary style was Atticistic imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime. - Paolo Caliari, known as Paolo Veronese (15281588), was an Italian Renaissance painter, based in Venice, known for large-format history paintings of religion and mythology, such as \\"The Wedding at Cana\\"(1563) and \\"The Feast in the House of Levi\\" (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the \\"cinquecento\\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Lucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585 . - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth. - Tintoretto (born Jacopo Comin, late September or early October, 1518 May 31, 1594) was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the Renaissance school. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso. His work is characterized by its muscular figures, dramatic gestures, and bold use of perspective in the Mannerist style, while maintaining color and light typical of the Venetian School. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The work is a large-format (6.77 m × 9.94 m) oil painting executed in the Mannerist style of the High Renaissance (14901527); as such, \\"The Wedding Feast at Cana\\" is the most expansive canvas (67.29 m) in the paintings collection of the Musée du Louvre. - Mannerism is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, lasting until about 1580 in Italy, when the Baroque style began to replace it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century. - Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\") covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood. - The Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring . It is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. It was painted by Veronese for the rear wall of the refectory of the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, a Dominican friary, as a \\"Last Supper\\", to replace an earlier work by Titian destroyed in the fire of 1571. - Cinquecento ('five hundred'; short for \\"millecinquecento\\" '1500') was the Italian Renaissance of the 16th century, including the current styles of art, music, literature, and architecture. - History painting is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. - Lucretia or Lucrece (died ) was an ancient Roman woman whose fate played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy.

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works.

While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift.

Remember, our goal is to figure out what number 'q' stands for. First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We have 29 - 44, which is equal to -15 (imagine starting at 29 and going back 44 steps, you end up at -15). So, our equation now looks like this: -3*q = -15 Now, let's find 'q'! We do that by getting 'q' all by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll need to remove the -3 that's currently multiplying 'q'. Imagine dividing both sides of the equation by -3 (like sharing -3 cookies with each friend). When we do this, we get: q = -15 / -3 Now, let's do the division: -15 divided by -3 equals 5.

Tweet:niggas got they eyes on me and i aint talkin bout da BM when i say i got 745 on me","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this tweet, I will perform a step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the relevant components of the tweet. The tweet focuses on someone having their eyes on the speaker, and the speaker mentioning he has a \\"745\\" on him, which seems to be a reference to a BMW 745 vehicle. The term \\"niggas\\" is an informal, colloquial term that, while potentially offensive, is often used in certain contexts to refer to friends or acquaintances. 2. Analyze the sentiment of each component. - \\"niggas got they eyes on me\\": This statement can be interpreted as either positive or negative, depending on the context. It could imply admiration and attention from others (positive), or it could suggest that people are monitoring or targeting the speaker (negative). - \\"i aint talkin bout da BM\\": This phrase acts as a clarification and doesn't carry a specific sentiment. - \\"when i say i got 745 on me\\": This statement implies the speaker is in possession of a luxury car, which can be seen as a status symbol and might be considered as a positive sentiment due to the potential success it signals. 3. Combine the sentiments of each component to deduce the overall sentiment. Since most of the sentiments in the tweet are either neutral or positive, with just one component having the possibility of being interpreted as either positive or negative. Due to the probable implication of the status symbol of having a luxury car, the overall sentiment of the tweet leans towards positive or boastful, although it could be seen as ambiguous without further context. Considering all these factors, my conclusion is that the sentiment of the tweet is predominantly positive or boastful, with a possibility of being seen as ambiguous depending on context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given that reviews alone do not resolve the question of the quality of acting in the four-hour Hamlet with its unlikely cast, it is important to look at other aspects that can provide more insight into the acting caliber of the production. Firstly, the casting choices are quite noteworthy and unconventional. Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, and Charlton Heston bring distinct personas and acting backgrounds to the table. Crystal is primarily known for his comedy, Williams for both comedy and drama, and Heston for his epic and intense roles. Therefore, the blend of these disparate styles may prompt curiosity in seeing how the actors adapt to the particular demands of Hamlet, a Shakespearean tragedy. While reviews provide opinions and critiques of the play, different reviewers might focus on unique aspects, such as the plot, directing, or costumes, making it difficult to conclusively say how well the play was acted. The mere fact that reviews do not resolve the question means that they either do not specifically address the acting, have conflicting opinions, or provide unclear evaluations of the performances. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the acting, it would be beneficial to consult additional sources. These could include audience reactions, interviews with the actors or director, or even analyzing recorded performances of the play, if available. Furthermore, it would be helpful to consider the actors' approaches to their respective roles and if they are successful in convincingly portraying the complex emotions and conflicts that Shakespeare's characters face. A close examination of pivotal scenes could reveal significant information about the quality of acting, such as how the cast interacts with one another, their command of language, and ability to convey raw emotions. Since the reviews concerning this production of Hamlet do not provide a definitive answer, it is not possible to tell whether the play was very well acted. Access to other information, such as audience responses and performance recordings, would greatly assist in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the cast's acting prowess in this adaptation of the classic tragedy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: China used alternative fuels to generate electricity, while Mongolia burned lots of fossil fuels. There were frequent debates between the two countries on this matter. and a hint : Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. Please answer this question : Which country released less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? The answer to this question is:","completion":"China. This is because China used alternative fuels to generate electricity. Alternative fuels are substances that can be used as fuels, other than conventional fuels. They are often produced from renewable resources, and their combustion generally results in less carbon dioxide emission compared to conventional fossil fuels. On the other hand, Mongolia burned lots of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, when burned, release a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Therefore, the combustion of fossil fuels contributes significantly to global warming due to the emission of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Thus, considering the information provided, it can be deduced that China would have released less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere compared to Mongolia. This is due to the difference in their energy-generating methods - with China opting for alternative, less carbon-intensive fuels, while Mongolia used conventional fossil fuels with high carbon emissions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior.

The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise. The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions. Groups of twos and threes stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only of regaining their horses. In three minutes after the Royalists entered the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued by the victorious Cavaliers. These, being for the most part better mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot. The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe. He found that more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms, those quartered in the inn, and at two or three of the larger houses, having alone maintained a successful resistance until the arrival of succor.

Why did the US and USSR have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons when only a few hundred would've been enough to destroy the other country? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: + no. + yes.","completion":"The two questions raised are not the same, but they share a common theme: the influence of political, social, and historical factors on the strategic decision-making of nations. To address each question in detail: 1. Why do some Americans wrongly think Russia would conquer Europe without the few thousand US soldiers stationed on the continent? This perception can be attributed to a number of factors, including historical events, the media, and a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities. Historically, Europe has been the battleground for major wars and conflicts, particularly during World War II, when the Soviet Union expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe. This created a sense of wariness among Western countries, leading to the establishment of NATO in 1949, with the objective of providing collective security against potential Soviet aggression. The United States has been a key player in NATO, and its military presence in Europe is seen as a deterrent to Russian ambitions. The media has also played a role in shaping this perception, with a tendency to focus on Russia's aggressive actions, such as its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. This reinforces the fear of a Russian invasion of Europe. Moreover, movies and books from popular culture have often depicted Russia as a nefarious adversary to the West, which can exacerbate anxiety about its intentions. Furthermore, there may be a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities and strategies. Conventional warfare is no longer the only method for securing power and influence. Today, nations rely more on soft power and covert operations, economic leverage, and cyber-warfare to achieve their objectives. It is not necessary for Russia to physically conquer Europe, as they can wield influence through these other means. The presence of American troops in Europe, while a significant deterrent, does not solely determine Russia's ability to achieve its goals. 2. Why did the US and USSR have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons when only a few hundred would've been enough to destroy the other country? The reason for this lies in the principle of deterrence and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which were dominant during the Cold War era. Deterrence, in this context, means that by possessing a large number of nuclear weapons, each side could guarantee that it could retaliate and cause devastating consequences to the other side in the event of an attack. The potential devastation was intended to prevent either side from considering a preemptive nuclear strike, as it would essentially be suicidal. The balance of nuclear power acted as a stabilizing factor, despite the inherent risks involved. MAD's rationale is the idea that if both sides possess enough nuclear firepower to completely annihilate the other, regardless of who initiates the conflict, it would eliminate any incentive for either side to start a nuclear war. With this mindset, possessing significantly more nuclear weapons than necessary to destroy the other country may seem like an advantage, as it might convince the opponent that retaliation would be even more catastrophic. In summary, both questions raise distinct issues regarding strategic decisions made by the US and Russia (or the USSR), but they are not the same. One focuses on the perception of Russian aggression and the importance of US military presence in Europe, while the other delves into the rationale behind the possession of large nuclear arsenals during the Cold War. Yet, both questions highlight the significant impact of historical, social, and political factors on national security decision-making."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The once-thriving planet has turned into a polluted wasteland, and humans have been forced to live in domed cities to breathe in artificial atmosphere. In the heart of this dying world stands the final tree, a giant sequoia, the last remnant of the lost paradise which once blanketed Earth. The tree's imminent collapse symbolizes the complete destruction of nature and the final triumph of the greedy industrialist, known only as the Once-ler. As the final tree's collapse nears, a prophecy begins to circulate among the inhabitants of the domed cities. It speaks of a hidden oasis, known as the Valley of Edena, where the last seeds and remnants of Earth's flora and fauna are preserved. The legend says that the one who finds the valley and plants the seed of the final tree will be able to restore Earth to its former magnificence. Our protagonist, a young and idealistic botanist named Lina, embarks on a dangerous quest to find the Valley of Edena and save the world before it's too late. Accompanied by her eclectic crew, consisting of a hardened wasteland scavenger, a tech wiz, and a wise old sage, Lina ventures into the dystopian wilderness, facing treacherous challenges, uncovering buried secrets and rediscovering the lost connection between humans and nature. Meanwhile, the Once-ler, who has amassed both wealth and influence by profiting off the world's destruction, has caught wind of the prophecy and Lina's quest. Fearing that her efforts to restore nature will render his business obsolete, he hires a ruthless mercenary to hunt down Lina and bring an end to her mission. As Lina gets closer to the prophesied location of the Valley of Edena, the challenges intensify, and she must confront her own doubts, the temptation of giving up, and face the ultimate showdown with the Once-ler's henchmen. In this climactic battle, Lina must harness the power of the last tree and discover that the key to revitalizing Earth's ecosystem lies not only in the seeds of plants but also the seeds of hope and courage within the human spirit. In the end, against all odds, Lina and her crew save the final tree, plant its seed in the Valley of Edena, and set the world on a path towards healing. Although it will take time and effort to undo the damage inflicted upon Earth, the first step is taken, and hope is restored.

I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream.

But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit.

He rejected bands like Immortal being called black metal, \\"as they are not Satanists\\", but supported the band nonetheless. As noted earlier, bands who had LaVeyan beliefs were also rejected. When it was pointed out that Venom (the band who coined the term 'black metal') only used 'Satanism' as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the 'Black Circle' \\"choose to believe otherwise\\". Likewise, Euronymous said that the term death metal can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band \\"cultivates and worships death\\". Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal.

Answer the following question: Information: - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Text figures (also known as non-lining, lowercase, old style, ranging, hanging, medieval, billing, or antique figures or numerals) are numerals typeset with varying heights in a fashion that resembles a typical line of running text, hence the name. They are contrasted with lining figures (also called titling or modern figures), which are the same height as upper-case letters. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - In typography, leading refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. The term originated in the days of hand-typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type. The term is still used in modern page layout software such as QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign. - In typography, a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic\\" means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. It is a different font from \\"ITC Garamond Condensed Italic\\" and \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed,\\" but all are fonts within the same typeface, \\"ITC Garamond.\\" ITC Garamond is a different typeface from \\"Adobe Garamond\\" or \\"Monotype Garamond.\\" (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.) There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly. - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. - In typography, line length is the width of a block of typeset text, usually measured in units of length like inches or points or in characters per line. A block of text or paragraph has a maximum line length that fits a determined design. - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. - A written language is the representation of a spoken or gestural language by means of a writing system. Written language is an invention in that it must be taught to children, who will pick up spoken language (oral or sign) by exposure even if they are not specifically taught. - In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area. - In typography , small capitals ( usually abbreviated small caps ) are uppercase ( capital ) characters set at the same height and weight as surrounding lowercase ( small ) letters or text figures . They are used in running text to prevent capitalized words from appearing too large on the page , and as a method of emphasis or distinctiveness for text alongside or instead of italics , or when boldface is inappropriate . For example , the all - caps TEXT IN CAPS appears as text in caps in small caps . They can be used to draw attention to the opening phrase or line of a new section of text , or to provide an additional style in a dictionary entry where many parts must be typographically differentiated . Well - designed small capitals are not simply scaled - down versions of normal capitals ; they normally retain the same stroke weight as other letters and have a wider aspect ratio for readability . Typically , the height of a small capital will be one ex , the same height as most lowercase characters in the font . In Anglo - Saxon typography , small caps are somewhat larger than the x-height . For example , in some Tiro Typeworks fonts , small caps are 30 % larger than x-height , and 70 % the height of full capitals . To differentiate between these two alternatives , the x-height form is sometimes called petite caps , preserving the name \`\` small caps '' for the larger variant . OpenType fonts can define both forms via the \`\` small caps '' and the \`\` petite caps '' features . Because the support for the petite caps feature is absent from most desktop - publishing programs , many fonts use x-height small caps in the small - caps feature . Many word processors and text - formatting systems include an option to format text in caps and small caps , which leaves uppercase letters as they are , but converts lowercase letters to small caps . How this is implemented depends on the typesetting system ; some can use true small caps associated with modern professional fonts , making text such as \`\` Latvia joined Nato on... - Type design is the art and process of designing typeface. - The ISO basic Latin alphabet is a Latin-script alphabet and consists of two sets of 26 letters, codified in various national and international standards and used widely in international communication. - In typography, letter-spacing, usually called tracking by typographers, refers to a consistent degree of increase (or sometimes decrease) of space between letters to affect density in a line or block of text. What entity does 'small caps' has the relation 'instance of' with? Answer:","completion":"Small caps has the relation 'instance of' with typography.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What is the result of a dolphin keeping a high metabolism rate?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high\\" and \\"all dolphins are mammals and all mammals breathe air\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The result of a dolphin keeping a high metabolism rate is efficient thermoregulation and maintenance of a stable body temperature to enable effective functioning in their aquatic environment. To further elaborate on this answer, we should first understand the key concepts involved. Metabolism is the sum of all chemical processes occurring within an organism to maintain life, including breaking down food into energy and synthesizing necessary compounds for growth and repair. Metabolic rate refers to the speed at which these processes occur. A higher metabolic rate means that the organism is using more energy and generating more heat as a byproduct of this energy production. As mammals, dolphins are warm-blooded, which means they can efficiently maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the surrounding environment. This is an essential trait, especially for aquatic mammals like dolphins, which often encounter significant temperature fluctuations in the water. Because all mammals are warm-blooded and that all dolphins are mammals, as mentioned by the teacher, they must keep their metabolic rates high to generate the heat needed to maintain their body temperature in a wide range of thermal conditions. This high metabolic rate enables dolphins to stay active in various water temperatures. For example, by keeping their metabolism high, dolphins generate heat that allows them to quickly replace cold water with warm blood near the surface of their bodies, which helps maintain an optimal internal temperature. This is crucial for overall body function and survival, especially when foraging for food or avoiding predators. In summary, the best answer to the question is that the result of a dolphin keeping a high metabolism rate is efficient thermoregulation and maintenance of a stable body temperature, which allows them to adapt to various aquatic environments and perform essential tasks for survival effectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's an easy way to think about it. You owe someone 180,913 candies, and then you borrow 49,930 more candies from another friend. In total, you will owe 180,913 + 49,930 = 230,843 candies. So, the equation will look like this: -230,843 = -3472 * t + 119,829 2. Next, let's take away 119,829 candies from both sides to make it easier: -230,843 - 119,829 = -3472 * t When we take away these candies, we're left with -350,672 candies: -350,672 = -3472 * t 3. Now, we need to find how many times -3472 candies fit into -350,672 candies. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -3472: -350,672 ÷ -3472 = t When we divide these, we find that t = 101. So, the answer is t = 101. Great job, little buddy!

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Ok, this one is not missing a class but much better story IMO. When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’ This was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough. I know none of that is allowed these days, but those were both good deterrents for me!! Question: How long did i take the author to do the first assignment?

Q: Paragraph: The scientists, who treated the monkeys with a neuroprosthetic interface that acted as a wireless bridge between the brain and spine, say they have started small feasibility studies in humans to trial some components. “The link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord – to make this communication exist – is completely new,” said Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at the Lausanne University Hospital who surgically placed the brain and spinal cord implants in the monkey experiments. “For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface.” Gregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) which led the work, cautioned that there are major challenges ahead and “it may take several years before this intervention can become a therapy for humans.” Publishing their results in the journal Nature on Wednesday, the team said the interface works by decoding brain activity linked to walking movements and relaying that to the spinal cord – below the injury – through electrodes that stimulate neural pathways and activate leg muscles. In bypassing the injury and restoring communication between the brain and the relevant part of the spinal cord, the scientists successful treated two rhesus monkeys each with one leg paralyzed by a partial spinal cord lesion. One of the monkeys regained some use of its paralyzed leg within the first week after injury, without training, both on a treadmill and on the ground, while the other took around two weeks to recover to the same point. “We developed an implantable, wireless system that operates in real-time and enabled a primate to behave freely, without the constraint of tethered electronics,” said Courtine. “We understood how to extract brain signals that encode flexion and extension movements of the leg with a mathematical algorithm. We then linked the decoded signals to the stimulation of specific hotspots in the spinal cord that induced the walking movement.” The brain and spinal cord can adapt and recover from small injuries, but until now that ability has been far too limited to overcome severe damage. Other attempts to repair spinal cords have focused on stem cell therapy and on combinations of electrical and chemical stimulation of the cord. Independent experts not directly involved in this work said it was an important step towards a potential future where paralyzed people may be able to walk again. Simone Di Giovanni, a specialist in restorative neuroscience at Imperial College London, said EPFL’s results were “solid, very promising and exciting” but would need to be tested further in more animals and in larger numbers. “In principle this is reproducible in human patients,” he said. “The issue will be how much this approach will contribute to functional recovery that impacts on the quality of life. This is still very uncertain.” Claim: Paralyzed monkeys walk again with wireless 'brain-spine interface'.

Part #2: There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A lieutenant (abbreviated Lt., LT, LTA, Lieut., LEUT and LEUT.) is a junior commissioned officer in many nations' armed forces, fire service or police. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - The Silver Star, officially the Silver Star Medal, is the United States military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat. The Silver Star is awarded primarily to members of the United States Armed Forces for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States. - This is a complete list of Marines from the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment who have been awarded the United States 's Medal of Honor , Navy Cross , or Silver Star . An asterisk after a recipient 's name indicates that the award was given posthumously . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer. - A battalion is a military unit. The use of the term \\"battalion\\" varies by nationality and branch of service. Typically a battalion consists of 300 to 800 soldiers and is divided into a number of companies. A battalion is typically commanded by a lieutenant colonel.

Here are some certifications that require applicants to demonstrate their ability through various assessment methods, including exams, practical projects, or workplace experience: 1. ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) Advanced Level Certifications: The ISTQB offers three Advanced-Level certifications that each focus on a specific area of expertise: Test Manager, Test Analyst, and Technical Test Analyst. These certifications require a foundation-level certification as a prerequisite, as well as a minimum of three years of professional experience in software testing. Each advanced-level certification has its examination, which tests both theoretical knowledge and practical application of testing concepts. 2. CSTE (Certified Software Tester) by the QAI Global Institute: The CSTE certification process involves the completion of a Common Body of Knowledge, followed by a comprehensive examination. Candidates also need to submit an application detailing their experience in the field, demonstrating their ability to apply the Common Body of Knowledge principles practically. 3. ISEB (Information Systems Examination Board) Practitioner Level Certificates: The ISEB offers the ISEB Practitioner Certificate in Software Testing to professionals who have achieved the ISEB Foundation Level Certificate. The foundation level certificate tests theoretical knowledge, while the practitioner level examination requires candidates to complete practical projects and solve real-life testing scenarios. 4. CMST (Certified Manager of Software Testing) by the QAI Global Institute: The CMST certification process involves the completion of a Common Body of Knowledge, accompanied by a comprehensive examination and work product evaluation. Candidates must submit a detailed application highlighting at least eight years of professional experience and have completed a software testing management project, demonstrating their competency in the subject. 5. TMMi (Test Maturity Model integration) Professional Certification: This certification is offered by the TMMi Foundation, aimed at testing professionals who have the necessary experience and knowledge of the TMMi model. A TMMi Professional examination tests the individual's ability to apply the TMMi model and demonstrate their understanding of the model's principles. While no single certification can guarantee an individual's competence or professionalism as a tester, these certification programs are designed to combine both knowledge-based assessments and practical applications that require candidates to demonstrate their ability in software testing or quality assurance.

Read this: In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning.

This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Question: Triceps and biceps muscles in the upper arm are an example of what type of muscle relationship? Answer: opposing","completion":"To provide supporting facts for the answer \\"opposing\\" in the context of the triceps and biceps muscle relationship in the upper arm, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Explain the basic function of biceps and triceps muscles. The biceps are the muscles located on the front of the upper arm, and they are responsible for flexing the arm at the elbow. The triceps are located at the back of the upper arm and are responsible for extending or straightening the arm at the elbow. Step 2: Describe the contraction and relaxation process of the muscles. When one muscle contracts, the opposite muscle relaxes. For instance, when the biceps contract, the triceps relax to allow arm flexion, and when the triceps contract, the biceps relax to allow arm extension. Step 3: Explain the concept of antagonistic muscle pairs. Muscles work in pairs called antagonistic pairs (or opposing muscle pairs), where one muscle functions to produce a movement while the other muscle opposes or reverses the action. This relationship allows for precise and controlled movements. Step 4: Provide the connection between steps 2, 3, and the given answer. The relationship between triceps and biceps muscles exemplifies an antagonistic/opposing muscle pair as they work in tandem to create controlled movements by contracting and relaxing reciprocally, allowing for the flexion and extension of the arm at the elbow."},{"prompt":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\".....

The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump , produce eggs from swallowed enemies , and transform into vehicles . The game 's hand - drawn aesthetic -- a style new to the series -- descends from producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto 's distaste for the computer pre-rendered graphics of the game 's contemporary Donkey Kong Country . After four years of development , Yoshi 's Island was released in Japan in August 1995 , and worldwide two months later . Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip .

The first game where he was available as a primary character was \\"Super Mario Bros. 2\\". In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the \\"Mario Party\\" and \\"Mario Kart\\" series, though he has been featured in a starring role on three occasions: first in the 1991 educational game \\"Mario Is Missing!\\", in \\"Luigi's Mansion\\" for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, and in \\"\\" for the 3DS. In all three of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and occasionally by other members of the \\"Mario\\" cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first title in the series, \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every \\"Super Mario\\" game since. These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special magic powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into giant and miniature sizes. - , subtitled for its original Japanese release, is a 1990 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a pack-in launch title for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).

In Japan, the system is called the , or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy ( \\"Syupeo Keomboi\\") and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. It was released in Brazil on September 2, 1992, by Playtronic. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - In the game, Mario is portrayed as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The gameplay focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on their backs and kicking them away. The original versions of \\"Mario Bros.\\"the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) versionwere received positively by critics. - There have been five \\"Mario Kart\\" games released for home consoles, three portable games, and three Namco co-developed arcade games, for a total of eleven. The latest title in the series, \\"Mario Kart 8\\", was released on Wii U in May 2014. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.

The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - Concept and creation. Shigeru Miyamoto stated that Nintendo had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since the first release of \\"Super Mario Bros.\\"; however, it was not possible because of the limitations of the NES. The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back further, to the green dragon Tamagon in the 1984 video game \\"Devil World\\". Coincidentally, both are green lizards that hatch from eggs and can eat enemies with their large mouth, and also emit the same noise when they hatch. During the development of \\"Super Mario Bros. 3\\", Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a dinosaur. Takashi Tezuka, a \\"Mario\\" series developer, speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding as well as country and western themes influenced Yoshi's creation. The concept of Mario riding a dinosaur also came from the NES video game \\"Excitebike\\", which featured people riding motorcycles. He again wanted to feature Yoshi in \\"Super Mario Bros. 3\\", but was still unable to. Tezuka designed two power-ups (the frog suit and racoon tail) to make up for this limitation. - After the development of \\"Mario Party 8\\", several of Hudson Soft's key designers left to work for Nintendo subsidiary Nd Cube, developers of \\"Wii Party\\". Starting in 2012 with \\"Mario Party 9\\", Nd Cube has taken over development of the series from Hudson Soft. The latest title in the series, \\"\\", was released in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS.

Background: Daryl Hall and John Oates, often referred to as Hall & Oates, are an American musical duo. Daryl Hall is generally the lead vocalist; John Oates primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals. The two write most of the songs they perform, separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues. Context: Their next album, H2O, a very polished, synth-heavy effort, became the duo's most successful album, with US sales eventually approaching four million copies. H2O reached #3 on the Billboard album chart (where it held for 15 weeks) and spawned three Top 10 singles. \\"Maneater\\", the biggest hit of their career, reached Number 1 on December 18, 1982 and stayed there for four weeks. The soulful ballad \\"One on One\\" and a cover of Mike Oldfield's \\"Family Man\\" reached Number 7 and Number 6 in March and June 1983, respectively. According to John Oates, they recorded approximately 20 songs for the album, of which 9 didn't make the final cut. He went on to say they usually would have 5 or 6 tracks left over per album. \\"One On One,\\" with its clever mixed-metaphorical references to romance and basketball, was used in NBA commercials of the period. The commercial featured numerous players, including Hall of Famer James Worthy performing a 360-degree slow-motion lay-up during the saxophone solo. For the H2O album, Hall and Oates made some permanent changes to their current band. Drummer Mickey Curry, who had appeared on some Private Eyes tracks, including the title song, replaced Jerry Marotta full-time. Bassist Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Wolk, who had mimed John Siegler's bass line in the \\"Private Eyes\\" video, replaced Siegler full-time. These two joined the band's holdovers--lead guitar player G.E. Smith, and saxophonist Charlie \\"Mr. Casual\\" DeChant. De Chant and Wolk continued to perform with the duo until Wolk's death in early 2010, while Curry returned for the Do It for Love sessions.

On some large locomotives, a booster engine was mounted on the trailing truck to provide extra tractive effort when starting a heavy train and at low speeds on gradients. - The Caledonian Railway (CR) was a major Scottish railway company. It was formed in the early 19th century with the objective of forming a link between English railways and Glasgow. It progressively extended its network soon reaching Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with a dense network of branch lines in the area surrounding Glasgow. It was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Many of its principal routes continue active at the present day, and the original main line between Carlisle and Glasgow is in use as part of the West Coast Main Line railway (with a modified entry into Glasgow itself). - The Caledonian Railway 300 Class were freight 0 - 6 - 0 tender engines introduced in 1918 and designed by William Pickersgill . Forty - three were built between 1918 and 1920 . They were numbered 294 -- 324 , 280 , 281 , 670 -- 679 by the Caledonian Railway . - A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks, instead of a more traditional tender. A tank engine may also have a bunker (or oil tank) to hold fuel. There are several different types of tank locomotive, distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers. The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler. This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks, and later for shunting and shorter distance main line duties. Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional tender locomotives. - Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and third largest in the United Kingdom. Historically part of Lanarkshire, it is now one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians. - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods. - In rail transport, a wheel arrangement or wheel configuration is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed under a locomotive. Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type, position, and connections, with the adopted notations varying by country. Within a given country, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered. - Aberdeen is Scotland's third most populous city, one of Scotland's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom's 37th most populous built-up area, with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen itself and 228,990 for the local authority area. Aberdeen is the Oil Capital of the World. - The West Coast Main Line (WCML) is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - Chief mechanical engineer and locomotive superintendent are titles applied by British, Australian, and New Zealand railway companies to the person ultimately responsible to the board of the company for the building and maintaining of the locomotives and rolling stock. In Britain, the post of \\"locomotive superintendent\\" was introduced in the late 1830s, and \\"chief mechanical engineer\\" in 1886. - The Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in \\"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\\". The notation counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, groups of numbers being separated by dashes. Other classification schemes, like UIC classification and the French, Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels. - William Pickersgill (1861 2 May 1928) was chief mechanical engineer of the Caledonian Railway from 1914 until Grouping in 1923. He was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Northern Division of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but retired in 1925. He died in Bournemouth. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders. - Bournemouth is a large coastal resort town on the south coast of England directly to the east of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 183,491 making it the largest settlement in Dorset. With Poole to the west and Christchurch in the east, Bournemouth forms the South East Dorset conurbation, which has a total population of over 465,000.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. There are many different varieties of wide-brimmed hats on the market. Take a look at different brands and styles of wide-brimmed hats and figure out a style that you like. Look online or visit a hat store to get an idea of what styles you like. Think about where you live and how the hat will be received from others around you. For instance, cowboy hats are commonplace in the south and midwest but are far less common in northern states. Popular examples of wide-brimmed hats include boater hats, skimmer hats, fedoras, trilbys, gambler hats, derby hats, and cowboy hats. Bowler hats have a two-inch brim with a rounded top. This style was popular in 1800’s and early 1900’s. Western hats, sometimes known as cowboy hats were worn in the Midwest. These hats have characteristically wide brims. Derby hats are usually worn by women and have elaborate bows and are usually worn at derby racing. Wide brimmed hats use a variety of different materials for different kinds of hats. Decide on the type of material you want, based on style and climate. Materials like wool, leather, and fleece are good for the cold weather while materials like straw, bamboo, and linen are best for hotter weather. Try on different styles of hats to see what kind of material feels best on your head. Take a look at budgetary constraints and decide how much you would like to invest in a hat. It's typically advised to purchase a more expensive hat made of a finer material instead of buying a cheaper hat made of synthetic material if you plan on wearing it often. Kentucky derby hats can cost anywhere from 135 to thousands of dollars per hat. Bucket hats are often constructed of cheaper materials like polyester or cotton. Decide what color you want your hat to be and what works well with your skin pigmentation and undertones. Determine if you have a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone. To find your undertones, look at the veins in your wrist under light and determine their color. You have a warm tone if you have dark brown or dark blonde hair and a green or golden undertone. You have a cool tone if you have very dark hair or light blonde hair with a blue undertone. Neutral toned people fall somewhere in the middle and often have hazel eyes with warmer toned hair. People with a warm tone look best in blues, greens, golden yellows, and creamy whites. People with cool skin tones look best in bright blue, lavender, ruby, gray, and navy. People with neutral skin tones look best in light peach, red, yellows, and off-whites. When you wear a wide-brimmed hat, it's important that you select the right clothing so that it doesn't come off like you are trying too hard. Try to select outfits where the hat accentuates the overall look. Don't try to plan an outfit around your hat. For men, make sure that the rest of your clothes are fitted well and not loose or baggy. For female clothing, this means wearing longer and looser clothing the larger your brim gets. A denim jacket, white t-shirt, and slim fitted jeans work well with a fedora or bowler hat. A flowing dress, sandals, and sunglasses go great with a derby hat. Wearing a baggy sports jacket or suit can make you look childish in a wide-brimmed hat. Make sure that your hat color does not clash with the colors that you're wearing on the rest of your body. While wearing a wide-brimmed hat may have been normal in the 40s and 50s, they are much less worn today. If you do decide to wear a wide brimmed hat, make sure that you wear it with confidence. Remain self-confident and own your look instead of fidgeting and touching your hat constantly. If you can't feel confident when wearing your wide brimmed hat, consider choosing another option for your hat. Summary:","completion":"1.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What village did the Priestleys move to?, using the article: Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

Movie title: Vampires: The Turning Context: Prologue: For many centuries, phi song neng (vampire spirits who have vowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the Far East. One day, over 800 years ago, a young, human warlord named Niran fell in love with a beautiful song neng woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked Niran during a Songkran []New Year] solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill humans for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and, thus, wipe out all the vampires in Thailand.Connor [Colin Egglesfield] and Amanda [Meredith Monroe] are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy [Dom Hetrakul] offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then suddenly turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Of course, Connor steathfully (i.e., ten steps behind) follows Kiko [Roger Yuan] home to Kong Sai House.When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours...

He was also the older brother of current Earth, Wind & Fire member Verdine White, and former member Fred White. He served as the band's main songwriter and record producer, and was co-lead singer along with Philip Bailey. With Maurice as the bandleader and producer of most of the band's albums, EWF earned legendary status winning six Grammy Awards out of a staggering 14 nominations, a star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame, and four American Music Awards. The group's albums have sold over 90 million copies worldwide. Other honors bestowed upon Maurice as a member of the band included inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Songwriters Hall of Fame and The NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. White brought the kalimba into mainstream use by incorporating its sound into the music of Earth, Wind & Fire. He was also responsible for expanding the group to include a full horn section - the Earth, Wind & Fire Horns, later known as the Phenix Horns. White began showing signs of the Parkinson's disease in 1987, and was finally forced to retire from Earth Wind & Fire in 1994. He retained executive control of the band and was still very active in the music business, producing and recording with the band and other artists. Messages of encouragement from celebrities including: Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Boyz II Men, Smokey Robinson, Isaac Hayes, Michael Jackson, Eric Clapton and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine were published for White. From time to time, after his retirement, he appeared on stage with Earth, Wind & Fire at events such as the 2004 Grammy Awards Tribute to Funk, and alongside Alicia Keys at Clive Davis's 2004 pre-Grammy awards party where they performed the band's 1978 hit \\"September\\".

Most of the coins are from the Fatimid Caliphate that once ruled parts of the region.","completion":"Title: Ancient Gold Treasure Unearthed from the Depths of the Sea Introduction In a remarkable discovery, divers exploring the ancient harbor of Caesarea stumbled upon nearly 2,000 gold coins that had been lying at the bottom of the sea for around 1,000 years. A significant portion of these coins belongs to the Fatimid Caliphate, a dynasty that once held sway over parts of the region. This fascinating find not only enriches our understanding of the area's history, but it also sheds light on the prowess of its former inhabitants in economics and maritime trade. The Discovery The group of divers was exploring the ancient harbor of Caesarea, an area renowned for its historical significance and archaeological treasures. As they delved into the depths of the sea, they happened upon a hidden treasure trove: a haul of nearly 2,000 gold coins. Given that they had remained submerged for approximately 1,000 years, the coins were in surprisingly excellent condition. The divers immediately reported their find to the appropriate authorities, who expressed great enthusiasm and gratitude for the vital addition to their understanding of the region's storied past. The Fatimid Caliphate Connection Upon closer examination, it was determined that the majority of the coins were minted during the time of the Fatimid Caliphate, a prominent dynasty that ruled over parts of the region during its reign, spanning from 909 to 1171 CE. The Fatimid Caliphate was not only known for its religious and political influence but also its economic prowess and participation in maritime trade. As such, it is plausible that the discovered coins were part of a valuable shipment destined to finance major projects or secure vital resources. Significance of the Discovery The discovery of these ancient gold coins serves many functions in our quest to better understand the history of Caesarea and the broader region. 1. Evidence of trade routes: The presence of Fatimid-era coins in the region reaffirms that the ancient harbor was part of the trade routes employed by the Fatimid Caliphate. 2. Testament to the ancient economy: The large quantity and excellent condition of the gold coins bear witness to the thriving economic conditions during that time. 3. Insight into maritime activity: The discovery underscores the significance of maritime trade and navigation for ancient cultures and civilizations. 4. A rich addition to the historical record: This treasure trove adds a tangible layer to our understanding of the region's past, enriching the historical narrative and serving as a precious resource for researchers and historians alike. Conclusion With the discovery of nearly 2,000 gold coins at the ancient harbor of Caesarea, we have been granted an incredible opportunity to learn more about the past and the many nuances of life that characterized those times. As the coins are further analyzed, reassembled, and displayed, they will serve as an enduring testament to the economic and maritime prowess of the Fatimid Caliphate and offer invaluable insights into a fascinating era of human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Man convicted for jealousy-fueled murder of ex-girlfriend's lover A jealous man was convicted Thursday for the murder of his ex-girlfriend’s new beau and dumping the body, then sending deceitful text messages from the dead man’s phone to cover his tracks. After three days of deliberations, a jury found Mikhail Chernyaev guilty for the September 19, 2012, murder of Charles Butler. Chernyaev, 50, faces 25 years to life in prison when Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Neil Firetog sentences him October 28. Butler, 46, had briefly dated the mother of Chernyaev’s son, Anna Lioznov, before he went missing. Man accused of murder told police 'there's a demon inside me' “A man senselessly lost his life out of sheer jealousy, leaving behind two grieving daughters and a young son,” said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson. Jurors were shown surveillance footage of Lioznov’s Brighton Beach apartment building where Butler was last seen alive. The Florida businessman’s decomposed corpse was found a month later in Hawk’s Nest, near Port Jervis, N.Y., by a fisherman, prosecutors said. Using a sketch constructed from the skeleton, a single usable fingertip print and DNA analysis, the body was positively identified as Butler in May 2013, prosecutors said. Woman testifies in jealous ex-boyfriend's murder trial During that time, Chernyaev used Butler’s SIM card in his own phone to pretend to be the dead man and broke up with Lioznov through text messages. Chernyaev was grilled by detectives for several hours before he admitted to killing Butler, driving the body upstate and pushing it over a cliff. He claimed self-defense. “I would like to commend the dedicated prosecutors, police officers and forensic experts who solved this complicated case and helped hold a calculated killer accountable,” said Thompson. Summary:","completion":"A man, Mikhail Chernyaev, was convicted for the jealousy-fueled murder of his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, Charles Butler, in 2012. The body was disposed of and Chernyaev sent deceptive text messages from the deceased's phone to cover his tracks. Despite claiming self-defense, Chernyaev was found guilty and faces 25 years to life in prison."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How did the eleven tribal nations in Montana get recognized? Context: Approximately 66,000 people of Native American heritage live in Montana. Stemming from multiple treaties and federal legislation, including the Indian Appropriations Act (1851), the Dawes Act (1887), and the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), seven Indian reservations, encompassing eleven tribal nations, were created in Montana. A twelfth nation, the Little Shell Chippewa is a \\"landless\\" people headquartered in Great Falls, recognized by the state of Montana but not by the U.S. Government. The Blackfeet nation is headquartered on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation (1851) in Browning, Crow on the Crow Indian Reservation (1851) in Crow Agency, Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Pend d'Oreille on the Flathead Indian Reservation (1855) in Pablo, Northern Cheyenne on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation (1884) at Lame Deer, Assiniboine and Gros Ventre on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation (1888) in Fort Belknap Agency, Assiniboine and Sioux on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation (1888) at Poplar, and Chippewa-Cree on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (1916) near Box Elder. Approximately 63% of all Native people live off the reservations, concentrated in the larger Montana cities with the largest concentration of urban Indians in Great Falls. The state also has a small Métis population, and 1990 census data indicated that people from as many as 275 different tribes lived in Montana.

People moved from there across town to The Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River for a gala performance. The performing arts space, named in honor of the late President John F. Kennedy, is marking its 40th anniversary this year, and this is the 34th time that it has honored individuals in a \\"celebration of the arts.\\" Past honorees run an entertainment gamut -- from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery in the movie world, to Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan in music, to Ginger Rogers and Mikhail Baryshnikov in dance, among dozens of others. This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and \\"America\\" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website.

Yo-Yo Ma -- described in his biography as the nation's \\"cellist-in-chief\\" -- has won 16 Grammy awards over his illustrious career and last year was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sunday night's only non-musical winner is actress Meryl Streep. She burst on the movie scene in 1978 in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" later winning plaudits for her roles in films such as \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" \\"Out of Africa\\" and more recently \\"Julie & Julia.\\" \\"We're just over the moon about this,\\" Cook said of her conversations with the four others about being celebrated Sunday. \\"It's once in a lifetime -- there's nothing else like this.\\" Others attending Sunday's events included actors Stanley Tucci, Robert DeNiro, Sarah Jessica Parker and Emily Blunt, and musician Smokey Robinson.

Several of them -- including DeNiro, Tucci and Robinson -- took the Kennedy Center on Sunday night to celebrate the honorees.

A two-hour recap of the gala will air the night of December 27 on CBS.

That sentiment was seconded on the red carpet by, among others, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \\"The arts are a very good investment because they're about the spirit of America (and) they encourage children to learn, to gain confidence through exercising their creativity,\\" the California Democrat said. \\"Imagination is what keeps us number one.\\"","completion":"The Kennedy Center Honors is a special yearly event where important people in arts, like music and acting, are celebrated for their amazing work.

The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994.

Summarize: Medway NHS Foundation Trust has made \\"substantial improvements\\", the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. Medway Maritime was one of 11 hospitals branded \\"inadequate\\" after Sir Bruce Keogh's review of hospitals in 2013. Previous inspections had highlighted concerns over patient safety, organisation and governance. BBC South East health correspondent Mark Norman said the hospital had spent 41 months in special measures, rather than the 12 months originally expected. Live: More on this story and other news from Kent Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt said: \\"Some of the problems at Medway were deeply entrenched - which makes the achievement all the greater.\\" Chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Sir Mike Richards, checked the trust over five days at the end of last year. In his inspection report, he said: \\"There is no doubt that substantial improvements have been made. The leadership team is now fully established and there is a strong sense of forward momentum.\\" As part of addressing its problems, the hospital took up a successful buddying arrangement with Guys' and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and is now \\"good\\" for effectiveness, care and leadership. It still \\"requires improvement\\" for safety and responsiveness. Lesley Dwyer, chief executive of the trust, said: \\"I am so pleased the improvements we are all so proud of have been recognised. This is a great tribute to our dedicated staff and the fantastic job they do day in, day out. \\"We acknowledge there is, of course, more to do. We have every reason to believe that we can build on this momentum and continue to improve.\\" When the hospital's chief executive stood up in front of a packed staff canteen and said the words \\"out of special measures\\" there were cheers, there was relief and even a few tears of joy. Four and a half thousand people work for the trust; one of their senior staff told me they have endured four years of being told they were no good at their job. Yes, the Care Quality Commission has some ongoing concerns, but when I first interviewed Lesley Dwyer almost two years ago she said she thought her biggest difficulty would be engaging the staff and reigniting a sense of believe in them. She would appear to have done that. The CQC highlighted the \\"commitments and hard work of the staff\\" in achieving this turnaround. There were some elements of \\"outstanding\\" practice at the trust, the inspection noted. The neonatal unit's breast-feeding at discharge rate has soared while a new bereavement suite for families experiencing a still birth, critical care services and the treatment of patients experiencing broken hips were all highly praised.

The night Democrats reclaimed “Obamacare” There’s been a major development in health-care politics over the last few months. The Obama administration and the Republicans came to an agreement on health reform. Not the law itself — they’re still at each other’s throats over that. But they finally agree on how to refer to it. Nowadays, both sides are calling it Obamacare. And during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, the Democrats talked about Obamacare. A lot. That was, in itself, a surprise. Obamacare — or, as it’s officially called, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — doesn’t poll particularly well, and it’s believed to have been a key contributor to the Republican victory in 2010. But Democrats appear to think that the politics have changed. Indeed, if the first night of the Democratic Convention is to be remembered for anything aside from Michelle Obama’s speech, it will probably be remembered as the night that Democrats stood up and began fighting for their health-care law. Michelle Obama and the Democrats doubled down on “Obamacare.” (Jae C. Hong/AP) “Governor Romney says people like me were the most excited about President Obama the day we voted for him,” said Stacey Lihn, whose daughter was born with a congenital heart defect. “But that’s not true. Not even close. For me, there was the day the Affordable Care Act passed and I no longer had to worry about Zoe getting the care she needed. There was the day the letter arrived from the insurance company, saying that our daughter’s lifetime cap had been lifted.” Lihn wasn’t shy about the stakes for her family. “Governor Romney repealing health care reform is something we worry about literally every day,” she said. “Zoe’s third open-heart surgery will happen either next year or the year after. If Mitt Romney becomes president and Obamacare is repealed, there’s a good chance she’ll hit her lifetime cap.” Michelle Obama, in the featured speech of the night, also emphasized the Affordable Care Act. “When it comes to the health of our families, Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day, another president,” she said. “He didn’t care whether it was the easy thing to do politically – that’s not how he was raised – he cared that it was the right thing to do.” The fact that Democrats even have the opportunity to take ownership of a health-care reform law is, in a way, a surprise. In 2006, it seemed entirely possible that Mitt Romney was going to take health care away from the Democrats as an issue. After all, here was the first working, near-universal health-care system in any state in the union, and it was by a Republican governor who was planning a run for president. Handicapping the race in April 2006, David Broder wrote that Romney’s “health plan gives him a unique calling card.” Endorsing Romney in January 2007, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) said, “he has demonstrated, when he stepped into government in a very difficult state, that he could work in a difficult partisan environment, take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured. Those kind of ideas show an ability to bring people together that we haven’t seen in national politics for a while.” Fast forward a year and Romney had already dropped his health-care plan, to the dismay of some Republicans. “Romney has distanced himself from his own innovative Massachusetts health-care reform,” wrote Michael Gerson, “fearful that his hidden virtues of creativity and bipartisanship might be exposed in public.” But if Republicans weren’t rallying around Romney’s plan, at least they were rallying around some plans. The initial version of Rep. Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap” included an ambitious health-care reform proposal that would have wiped out the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance and replaced it with a refundable tax credit for all Americans. A year later, when his Roadmap became the central legislative priority of House Republicans, he dropped the health-reform proposal from the budget. Republicans have almost entirely ceded the field on health care to Democrats. They ran in 2010 on “repeal-and-replace,” but they’ve never figured out a replacement. Romney has a “health care” section on his web site, but it’s so vague that it’s impossible to say what he actually intends to do. So far, that’s served them well. It’s allowed them to attack the Democrats’ Affordable Care Act without opening themselves up to criticism on the specifics of their plan. But it’s also meant that they don’t have specific answers for the health-care crisis. They don’t have anything to tell Stacey Lihn. That’s left an opening for the Democrats — an opening that, for the first time, they seem intent on taking. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Alright kiddo, this is a big topic, but I'll try to break it down in a simple way. Remember when we talked about laws and how they can help to protect people? Well, there was a big law introduced a while ago, called the Affordable Care Act, but some people also know it as Obamacare, after the president who introduced it, President Obama. This law was made to help people get medical help or treatment without having to worry about it costing too much money. So, recently at a big meeting called the Democratic National Convention, the people who belong to the Democratic party (that's one of our big political groups, like teams), spoke a lot about this law, Obamacare. They said they still really believe in it, and they want to keep fighting so it stays. In particular, they heard from a woman named Stacey Lihn, whose daughter was born with a heart problem. She explained how important the law was to her family, because it meant they didn't have to worry about whether they could afford her daughter's heart operations. Some people are worried though, because there's another team, called the Republicans, who have a different view. When they were in charge, they tried to change the way healthcare works in America too, through a plan known as Romney's plan, but they have since stopped pushing for it. Now, the Democrats are saying, \\"Hey, if you guys aren't going to help fix things, then we will.\\" That's the big fuss about it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an ordered list of reviews about \\"new years eve 2011\\".","completion":"To complete this task, I would first need to gather a variety of reviews about \\"New Year's Eve 2011\\". Note that New Year's Eve is a common annual occurrence that is celebrated differently by different people, so reviews about it can vary widely in content. However, for this task, I will assume that the user is referring to the 2011 American romantic comedy-drama film, \\"New Year's Eve\\". I will need to search reputable film review websites, critic reviews, and audience reviews to form an unbiased list. The list will be ordered by the source of review. 1. **Roger Ebert's Review (Chicago Sun-Times):** Well-known film critic Ebert gave \\"New Year's Eve\\" two out of four stars, praising its ensemble cast but critiquing its disorganized plot. He explained the film lacked depth and the multiple story arcs felt superficial. 2. **Rotten Tomatoes: Critics Consensus:** On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of just 7% based on 130 reviews. The site's critics consensus calls the film \\"shallow, sappy, and dull,\\" severely lacking in humor and festivities. 3. **User Ratings on IMDb:** As of December 2021, the film has an average rating of 5.7 out of 10 from over 78,000 users, indicating mixed to slightly negative reviews from general audiences. 4. **Review by Richard Roeper (RichardRoeper.com):** Roeper called the movie a \\"ridiculous, contrived, over-packed mess\\" suggesting that the multitude of subplot dilutes the overall storyline. 5. **Peter Travers' Review in Rolling Stone Magazine:** Travers gave the movie one star out of four. He described it as \\"stupefyingly dull and sappy even by Garry Marshall standards.\\" 6. **Audience Review on Letterboxrd:** User @CinemaLover praised the movie for its extensive star-studded cast but criticized its lack of comedy and meaningful plot. Regarded it as an average watch for New Year's Eve, not something to see over and over again. The variation among these reviews demonstrates that while professional critics largely disliked New Year's Eve 2011, general audiences were more mixed in their opinions.

Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me. It's a keep-forever book and I'm so happy to have it in my collection to share with the children I love most. Question: The purpose of this passage is to _ . Options: A: encourage people to buy Nancy Tillman's books for their children B: recommend Tillman's new book--Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You C: advocate the theme of love among family members D: Let children know they are loved and educate them to love others The answer is:","completion":"B: recommend Tillman's new book--Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You Step 1: Read the passage thoroughly to understand the main points and the overall message.

C: Although the theme of love among family members is present, the passage's main purpose isn't advocating it. D: The focus is not on educating children to love others, but rather on the message, illustrations, and value of Tillman's book. Step 4: Choose the best match based on the passage: B: The author's personal experience with Tillman's books, the vivid descriptions of the new book, and the praise for both the writing and illustrations demonstrate that the purpose is to recommend Tillman's new book - Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is the client Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch? is inside the article: The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: And perhaps that was an over-calculation. Sentence 2: The calculation was perfect. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"In order to determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, we need to analyze and understand the context and meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"And perhaps that was an over-calculation.\\" This sentence suggests that there might have been an error in the calculation or that the calculation yielded a result that was larger or more complex than necessary. The term \\"over-calculation\\" implies that there was an excessive estimation or a misjudgment of the situation, leading to an incorrect or inefficient outcome. The use of \\"perhaps\\" indicates that this is a speculation, not a definitive fact. Sentence 2: \\"The calculation was perfect.\\" This sentence states that the calculation was accurate, precise, and without any error or inefficiency. In this case, the outcome is considered flawless and completely correct, meeting or exceeding the expectations or requirements of the situation. Now, let us examine the relationship between these sentences. The first sentence implies that there could be an error in the calculation, while the second sentence claims that the calculation is perfect. These statements contradict each other, as a perfect calculation would not yield an over-calculation. Since these sentences are incompatible, it is impossible for both to be true simultaneously. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, which indicates the possibility of an over-calculation, then the second sentence cannot be true, as it claims that the calculation is perfect. Conversely, if the second sentence is true, then the first sentence cannot be true as it questions the calculation's perfection. So, to answer the question, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true, as they present conflicting views on the accuracy of the calculation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A mother has spoken out about the verbal abuse she received for breastfeeding in a Belfast restaurant.","completion":"Title: Mother Speaks Out Against Verbal Abuse for Breastfeeding in a Belfast Restaurant Introduction: In a recent incident that sheds light on the continuing stigma faced by breastfeeding mothers, a woman from Belfast recounts the verbal abuse she experienced for breastfeeding her child at a local restaurant. The mother's experience not only highlights the pressing issue of societal discrimination against breastfeeding but also calls for increased awareness and support for mothers choosing to breastfeed in public spaces. Background and Context: The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for infants up to two years of age, as it provides various health and developmental benefits to both the child and mother. Despite this, breastfeeding in public – often a practical necessity for new mothers – remains a controversial topic in many parts of the world. The Incident: The mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, shared her story in the hopes of raising awareness about the challenges breastfeeding mothers face in public spaces. According to her account, she was at a restaurant in Belfast when her baby began to cry for milk. As she discreetly began breastfeeding the child, another customer in the restaurant approached her and made derogatory and offensive comments. The individual criticised her actions as being inappropriate, and even questioned her character and parental abilities. Mother's Reaction: Taken aback by such comments, the mother felt humiliated and vulnerable in front of other patrons. She also expressed disappointment and frustration that she had to justify her choice of feeding her child in public. Nevertheless, she remains adamant about her decision and believes that she has every right to breastfeed her baby wherever and whenever necessary. Public Response and Support: Following the revelation of this incident, several people have come forward to express their solidarity with the mother and condemn the mistreatment she faced. Many individuals have shared their own experiences of breastfeeding in public and have called for an end to the stigma attached to the completely natural act of nurturing one's child. They have emphasized the need for society to respect and accommodate a mother's choice, advocating for greater tolerance in public spaces. Conclusion: This unfortunate incident underscores the need for continuous dialogue and education on breastfeeding and the challenges faced by nursing mothers in public. By bringing attention to this issue, the mother hopes to counteract persistent cultural biases and promote a more compassionate and understanding society. Increasing awareness and supporting breastfeeding mothers are essential steps in safeguarding their rights and ensuring they receive the respect and protection they deserve while nurturing the next generation."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: During the 2004–05 Boston Celtics season Gary Payton was traded for a basketball player that attened what univeristy?

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday met for 80 minutes in the Oval Office with a general he described as the second most powerful man in North Korea. Afterward, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that the June 12 summit in Singapore between him and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was back on. Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time.

Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. But I can use this background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. What is an answer for this question: In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","completion":"Rob would not observe the quarrying effect this year when he visited the Ural Mountains in Russia.

Text: tifu by having my penis touched for the first time. i've made some edits to the story so hopefully it is easier to read. sorry that it was poorly written before. --- when i was younger, i went on a lot of mission trips with my church. this takes place the summer after my 15th birthday. we all piled into the astrovan, 8 of us. my best friend growing up (let's call him sam), the main female in the story (let's call her hanna), and i took the back seats. she made herself comfortable between us in the middle of the backrow. soon, we were all piled in, the engine sputtered to life, and we were off. the trip this year was in ohio. it was roughly a three hour trip from home. maybe fifteen minutes into the trip, hanna brought out this massager. you may remember the type: green, four pronged, vibrating? we took turns giving each other innocent massages, but slowly, it's vibrations shook a palpable sexual tension over the back three seats of the van. it definitely was not uncommon to feel that way back then, but this was the first time i knew a female was feeling it about me, too. her massage found its way to my legs. a glancing buzz to my thigh. oddly enough, it was not just me getting the deluxe treatment. sam as well was being given the same genital teasing flyover. she was buzzing our towers, closer than tom cruise in top gun. then, as things reached a critical crossroads, sam passes me a note by way of his phone's notepad. \\"let her massage your dick,\\" it said. i was shy, very shy, but there was nothing hesitant about the urgent fashion i pecked out the letters n-o on that t9 keyboard. my urgency and reluctance, however, had met its match in sam's ability to manipulate simple text. as quickly as i had typed no, he changed it to yes and \\"accidentally\\" let hanna see. now, one thing we can all agree on, is a young, inexperienced male in the heat of puberty can be seduced by nothing more than a breeze. i was no different. moments later, her hand had slid up my gym shorts and her hands began to explore my crotch. i positioned a blanket over my lap and more or less gave her free reign of my undercarriage. now, despite my lifelong anticipation for what was now happening, it was accompanied by a sudden, saddening realization that she had not developed the same deft stroke that i had grown accustomed. i was the opposite of \\"enjoying it\\", but had enough worldly awareness to realize what was happening was too rare for me to reject. the setting wasn't great, her technique was worse, but i hope that you all will understand why i felt obligated to try my best to appreciate my circumstances. fast-forward an hour. imagine all the ways cosmopolitan had steered this poor girl wrong, and sympathize with me. i was paying the price of years of poorly researched techniques in somehow trustable printed ink. the fact that this treasonous act was still being performed on my royal jewels that long after should be evidence enough of her lack of prowess. there was a lot of squeezing and tugging, not things i would ordinarily associate with enjoyment in those regions. after a little more than an hour total, the astrovan stopped for lunch. as did the other vehicles. it was a great but only temporary reprieve. sam had a pb&j sandwich and a laugh at my suffering. i don't remember having much of an appetite. now let me remind you at this junction that we were on a mission trip, through our church, with my church's youth group. the mission trip was to last 5 days. we'd brought sleeping bags, pillows, and blankets so we'd be comfortable sleeping on the floor of a community center gymnasium. okay. got it? now let's continue. my reprieve, as i stated before, was only temporary. when we were back on the road, sam and i flipped our places in the back of the van, presumably to give her other arm a rest. almost immediately, it began again. i pulled my hat over my eyes, faking sleep, but the rise and fall of my blanket in my lap proved my restlessness. some thirty minutes later, something happened. something that gave me reasonable cause to write in to cosmo's complaint department and file a full-fledged grievance. the basketball shorts i was wearing hardly provided barrier to my more \\"protected\\" assets. her hand, being slid up my shorts, was right there...some guys like fingers in their rectum, i get that, but that section of the article should've been prefaced with adequate prerequisite stipulations. 1) never in a van, 2) never while with your church group 3) never suddenly, aggressively, or 4) while wearing sharp gel nails. fuck, man. this entire time, sam is very aware of my displeasure. i think he may of giggled, just then. fast forward five more minutes. sam, somehow still thoroughly entertained, in a merciful act of triage, gives her some much needed pointers. \\"pointers\\" of a completely different variety, if you catch my drift. i think he gestured to her the proper technique because suddenly things got a lot more focused in a great way. suddenly, it become pleasurable. the pleasure grows. finally, in much the fashion you'd expect of someone in my situation, i was not far from relief. this is where i unintentionally manufactured my revenge on this penal penile perpetrator. i lifted the blanket off my crotch as i orgasmed, exposing my cock and creating an uncertainty as where the explosion would go. her reaction, perhaps also from lack of real-life experience, was to raise a shield to protect herself from what i can only guess she assumed would be enormous, and deadly. and actually, to my surprise as much as hers, it was. it absolutely devastated her shield. which was her pillow. the one that she would be sleeping on for the next five nights... she made a sound then. not a grunt, or a scream. not a sound that has a name. for the sake of building it with your imagination, let's call it the \\"someone jizzed everywhere\\" sound. fleeting innocence, utter shock, sadness, fury, all boiled down into one cacophonous squeal. we haven't spoken since. -------","completion":"In a humorous situation during a church mission trip, a teenage boy finds himself receiving an unexpected and initially unpleasant experience from a female friend in the back of a van.

Article: You have several options when choosing a modelling clay to sculpt your face. Each clay is different, so choose the clay that best suits your purposes. Ceramic clays are water-based and easy to work with right out of the bag. It needs to stay moist while being worked, as it can dry out and crack. Ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture. Plasteline clay is an oil-based clay that doesn't dry out, and can't be fire hardened. It is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail. Polymer clays require an armature, or a wire skeleton, for support. They are weaker than other clays, but are good for painting. Polymer clays can be fire hardened, though they are not as hard as ceramic clays. Aside from the clay, you'll need a few other things before you can start sculpting. A good, clean working area is necessary, as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture. You can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores. You don't have to buy specialized tools for sculpting. It may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose. The main functions of your tools are to cut, scrape, and shape the clay. You can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay, and add detail. If you know the person whose face you are sculpting, take pictures of them from all angles. Try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera. Take some from the side as well to get a good profile. If you're basing your sculpture on a famous person, find photos on the internet and print them out. Make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person's proportions. It may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features. Think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture. Think about who they are, what they do, and why you want to sculpt them. Use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture. Do a rough drawing of different expressions to get some ideas for how you want your sculpture to look. The drawing doesn't have to be perfect. It's just a tool to help you plot out your sculpture.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

Write a title for this article: How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation (CNN) -- Inside a trailer in Honaker, Virginia, is a 5-year-old girl who loves lemon-lime slush. She sleeps in a room with a quilted bedspread and matching purple curtains. She adores her cat Tiger, dogs Smoky and Rusty and a black, pop-eyed goldfish. Her family is poor, and she is eating potted meat, blowing away cracker crumbs that fall into her lap. \\"Daddy,\\" she whispers when her father, a welder, comes home. He does not respond. His eyes are wild. He collapses into a rocking chair, his hands trembling, his breathing labored. She doesn't understand her father's strange behavior. It's as though he's in the grip of the devil. She hides behind the couch, her knees press against the shag carpeting. Later, she will remember this moment as the first time she was afraid of her father. A hole in her soul Christal Presley, 34, held her breath for two seemingly endless days in mid-October. In Honaker, more than 300 miles away from her home in Atlanta, her father had just received a package in the mail. It contained an early copy of Christal's new book. On the cover: a sepia-tone snapshot of Delmer Presley holding his rifle in Vietnam. Christal had staked her whole life on words crafted from love and pain. But what would they mean to her father? Delmer Presley, Christal Presley's father, was drafted before his 19th birthday and served a year in Vietnam. Would they offer comfort like the conversations that resulted in the book? Or would they act as another trigger point for a man who never left war behind? \\"Thirty Days With My Father\\" is a gritty memoir written by a woman haunted by what some psychologists describe as second-generation post-traumatic stress disorder. The trauma began in Vietnam, affected Delmer and then Christal, says psychiatrist Frank Ochberg, a trauma expert who served on the committee that defined PTSD in the post-Vietnam era. Christal, he says, suffered profound injury. And it stayed with her. Outwardly, her life appeared successful: She settled in Atlanta, owned a house, worked as an educator. But she always felt a hole in her soul. She didn't know her father -- or herself. How was it, she wondered, that a war that ended before her birth had marred her life in so many ways? The book became Christal's salvation -- \\"my last resort to find happiness,\\" she says. But she worried about how her father would feel seeing his troubled life exposed to the entire world. Encourage him to read the ending first, she told her mom. That way, he will understand: It's not just an ugly portrait of pain. It's a book about healing. Christal grew up affected by the post-traumatic stress disorder that her father suffered after fighting in Vietnam. Christal was only 5, but she remembers clearly that day when her family came undone. Her father, on his way home from work, had come upon an accident on the highway. His friend, Josh Coleman, was dead. It was the first time Delmer had seen a body since he returned from his yearlong tour of duty. Thirteen years had passed, but instantly, his mind reeled back to Vietnam: to underground tunnels brimming with snakes and booby traps laced with sharp punji sticks that skewered his buddies like meat. Christal never knew normal again. Gone was the man who gave her piggyback rides, ate mud pies and smiled as he watched her play an angel in a school play. Delmer vacillated between depression, silence and sheer rage. He locked himself in the bedroom his wife had decorated with shadow boxes filled with Delmer's medals, Army boots, hats, dog tags and a worn pocket-size military-issue Bible. The room screamed war, Christal says. She was scared to enter. At Christmas, Delmer never watched Christal open presents. She could hear him playing music in his room. She learned to resent the guitar her father loved so much. She wished he would spend time with her, speak to her, seek solace in her. When a truck backfired or Christal dropped a plate by accident, her father leaped up and went into soldier-at-war mode. Christal hated going out to eat at noisy restaurants -- everyone just stared. The worst moments came when he picked up his shotgun and left the house for Little River, announcing to Christal and her mother, Judy, that he was going to kill himself. As time passed, Christal forgot the daddy she'd once known. Judy, a Pentecostal Christian, believed you had to be perfect to reach heaven and kept the family's struggles secret. Christal pretended to the outside world that their life was normal. Once when she was 6, she stole a neighbor's photo of a family trip to the beach. She cut the family's smiling faces out and replaced them with pictures of herself and her mom and dad. She showed the doctored photo off in class, describing for her classmates what a great time they'd had. Ironically, it was Delmer's trauma that enabled Christal to escape her parents' home. Until then, every birthday had not been a celebration as much as it was a countdown to the day she'd turn 18 and be able to leave. The federal government paid for her schooling at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. That's because by then, the Army had declared her father 100% disabled. When Delmer returned from Vietnam in 1970, psychiatrists were just starting to recognize PTSD as an impairment. The first diagnosis for Vietnam veterans did not occur until 1980 when Christal was 2. Veterans weren't encouraged to seek help, like they are these days. \\"My dad just thought he was going crazy.\\" As frightening as it was for Christal to leave Honaker and be alone for the first time, she felt liberated. \\"I was so tired of living in a war zone,\\" she says. \\"I really thought my father ruined my life.\\" As a girl, she had taken a razor from her mother's sewing kit and sliced her skin open. She cut herself with an ink pen and stapled her hands. Hurting herself was a way to be close to her dad. He was in such pain, she thought, that she would be, too. In college, she mixed anti-depressants with rum and tequila and drank alone. She wanted to numb herself like PTSD sufferers do. She had her father's eyes -- and his behavior. Severe mood swings. Anxiety. She was hypersensitive to sounds. She stood back and skimmed the crowd in a room, looking for the quickest exit. She was private, reserved. She didn't trust people. She told Delmer she hated him. She went through boyfriend after boyfriend, craving a man's touch, looking for the affection her father had never shown. She dreaded driving back home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. As she approached winding John Douglas Wayside in Abingdon and began her climb up the Virginia mountains, she had flashbacks. She saw herself as a child wrapped tightly around Delmer's legs, trying to prevent him from going down to the river to kill himself. Or lying on her bed, curled into a fetal ball. In college, she saw a therapist regularly and didn't speak to her father, except peripherally, for 13 years. In that time, she came to understand that her troubles were related to his. \\"My father got that way from being in Vietnam,\\" Christal says. \\"I got it from being around him.\\" A baby Christal sits on Delmer's lap. He found solace in his music and would sometimes play the guitar eight hours a day. After college and teaching jobs and a brief marriage, Christal settled in Atlanta. But she ventured in several directions in search of an inner peace: to holy sites in the Indian Himalayas, to the halls of academia, where she earned a doctorate in education. Always, she came up empty. She'd begun writing as a way to understand herself and work through her problems. One day, her coach in a writing group challenged her to take on the subject she feared most. Her father. She decided to ask Delmer if he would participate in a series of conversations about Vietnam. Just in case things became unbearable, she set a time limit for her project: 30 days. She could stand anything as long as an end was in sight. She was sure Delmer would refuse. Why would he speak about it now when he had kept it to himself for almost four decades? When Delmer said yes, Christal was taken aback. She had been so certain he would not participate that she didn't even know how to begin. The first few conversations were strained. Delmer sounded suspicious. But by Day Four, he was telling her how he got a draft letter just before his 19th birthday. \\"It was after the Tet Offensive, the worst time to be drafted,\\" Delmer said. The surprise North Vietnamese military campaign is considered the turning point of the war. \\"America saw right then that this wasn't going to be a fast war,\\" he said. \\"The American people went berserk, turned against their own. They stopped supporting the war, hated us soldiers like devils.\\" Christal was humbled by her father's words. And appalled to learn of the public scorn. Such a thing would never happen today, she thought. The conversations continued day by day, through the end of 2009. Delmer talked about Agent Orange, the defoliant that rained down on the jungle from U.S. planes. He blames it for a tumor he developed in his right lung and cysts on his fingers. He told her he placed men he knew in body bags for their final journey home. She asked whether he was in My Lai when U.S. soldiers were ordered to wipe out the village -- unarmed civilians, including women and children. Delmer told her he was not but that he was ordered to pull guard the day Pentagon authorities went in to investigate. Christal had read about My Lai. She told her father that 500 bodies were found. \\"You are wrong about that,\\" Delmer said. \\"There were 504.\\" Christal had not known her father's anguish until then -- the moments he relived, the guilt he felt for surviving. With two months left in Vietnam, Delmer welcomed another young soldier to his platoon. The commanders made Delmer trade places with the newbie, who was placed at the front of the line in their battlefield maneuvers. Christal's mother, Judy, was embarrassed by the family's struggles and urged her daughter to keep them secret. The soldier stepped on a booby trap. Delmer never came to terms with the soldier's death. He knew the young man had a newborn daughter he had never seen. Delmer lay awake at night thinking: \\"It should have been me.\\" When her father shared that story, Christal was silent on the phone. She'd thought of her dad as a guy pointing a gun -- not as someone who suffered. Days after sending a copy of her book to her father, Christal met a woman who wanted to write about her project for a blog called Family Of A Vet. They talked over lunch at Tin Lizzy's restaurant near downtown Atlanta. The woman's husband did three tours of Iraq and is disabled by PTSD and traumatic brain injury. She takes care of him and her three young children. Daughter Caitlin, 9, had come along. Christal was talking about her 30-day project when Caitlin piped up. \\"Christal,\\" she said. \\"My mommy says your daddy was in a war, too.\\" \\"Yes, a long time ago, my daddy was in a war called Vietnam,\\" Christal told her. \\"Miss Christal,\\" said Caitlin. \\"Were you scared of your daddy like I am scared of mine? My daddy yells a lot, and I go into my room and hide.\\" \\"Caitlin,\\" said Christal. \\"Sometimes when someone comes back from war, they can't help themselves. Like a baby who cries.\\" Christal had always thought her father was distant and detached because he didn't love her. She always thought it was her fault. \\"Yeah, because they've seen bad things,\\" Caitlin said. Christal had spoken with other grown children of Vietnam veterans. But this was the first time she saw herself in a child. Christal contained herself in front of Caitlin. But when she and her mom drove away after lunch, Christal burst into tears. It was a week before her book launch. Christal had a calendar chock-full of media interviews. She was confident that veteran communities would welcome her book. She was less sure about her father. It took him two days to finish reading. The phone rang, finally, on a Tuesday afternoon. \\"It's a good book, Christal,\\" Delmer told her. \\"Do you like it?\\" she asked. No other review was going to matter. Along a living room wall in Christal's home in Atlanta stands a case containing a new Alvarez guitar. Delmer bought it for her three years ago, the first time they spent Christmas together after the 30-day project. She'd told him she wanted to learn how to play. She knows that without his music, her father might be dead. It kept him going after he couldn't work anymore. It was like an extra limb. Sometimes he played for eight hours a day. He loves Ricky Skaggs, Ralph Stanley. War songs. Even wrote one himself. \\"Having the guitar here makes me feel like a part of my father is here,\\" she says. He sketched out chords for her on pieces of white paper, but Christal has been so busy finishing her book, she hasn't had time to learn. Soon, she says, she will. The guitar is not the only talisman in her home tying Christal to her father. Inside a small silver urn is a piece of a sandbag. The color is still a vivid sky blue. Next to it is a piece of asphalt. She found them in Vietnam. After the series of talks with her father, Christal felt compelled to go to Vietnam, to Chu Lai, down Route 1, to the place the Americans called LZ (landing zone) Bayonet, to the fire base known as Fat City. Soldier's Heart, an organization that supports veterans and their families suffering from psychological wounds, made the trip possible. She climbed the slope of the landing pad where her father had slept. She gazed at a trench overgrown with grass and yellow wildflowers. The mountains behind her must have been where a young Delmer schlepped through thick jungle with a gun in his hand and a radio strapped to his back. She could still see tank tracks embedded in the asphalt. And boot prints. Christal stepped inside, Vietnam surging through her body. She felt ashamed she had treated her father the way she had. If only she could go back in time. Delmer felt the same way. He told her he locked himself away because he didn't want to hurt her. \\"I let her down,\\" he says. \\"It's my fault. I didn't realize I was hurting anyone.\\" One time, he was frantic on the phone with Christal. He hadn't burned any villages or killed any people, he told her as though someone were accusing him. She no longer thought him crazy. She told him he's the bravest person she knows. She is sorry she couldn't see that earlier. \\"I forgive you. I forgive myself,\\" Christal told him. Delmer says he's happy, at least, that before he hangs up the phone with Christal these days, he can say: \\"I love you.\\" There is a temple in Vietnam, lush with ponds and trees with branches hanging low. Outside, merchants sell birds, turtles and fish. Christal learns that people buy them and set them free in the temple, in accordance with the Eastern belief of the eternal nature of the soul. She thinks back on a childhood fishing trip with her father. The fish she caught swallowed the hook and worm whole. It bled through the gills and gasped for life. \\"She's dying,\\" Christal howled, begging Delmer to save it. Delmer was calm, confident. He cut the line, freed the fish and assured her it would live. It struggled for a few seconds and then dived deep into the water. Christal thinks now her father is like that fish -- a survivor. It is the day before she is to leave Vietnam and journey home. She steps forward, peers at the bags of goldfish for sale. One is black, like the fish she had in her aquarium as a little girl. That's the one she chooses.

Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor \\"Little Nikki\\" and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every \\"Air Band\\" at the time impersonating Prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

Background: Elizabeth was born on 3 February 1821 in a house on Dicksons Street in Bristol, England, to Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner, and his wife Hannah (Lane) Blackwell. She had two older siblings, Anna and Marian, and would eventually have six younger siblings: Samuel (married Antoinette Brown), Henry (married Lucy Stone), Emily (third woman in the U.S. to get a medical degree), Sarah Ellen (a writer), John and George. Four maiden aunts, Barbara, Ann, Lucy and Mary, also lived with Blackwell during Blackwell's childhood. Context: Once again, through her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a job, this time teaching music at an academy in Asheville, North Carolina, with the goal of saving up the 3,000 necessary for her medical school expenses. In Asheville, Blackwell lodged with the respected Reverend John Dickson, who happened to have been a physician before he became a clergyman. Dickson approved of Blackwell's career aspirations and allowed her to use the medical books in his library to study. During this time, Blackwell soothed her own doubts about her choice and her loneliness with deep religious contemplation. She also renewed her antislavery interests, starting a slave Sunday school that was ultimately unsuccessful. Dickson's school closed down soon after, and Blackwell moved to the residence of Reverend Dickson's brother, Samuel Henry Dickson, a prominent Charleston, physician. She started teaching in 1846 at a boarding school in Charleston run by a Mrs. Du Pre. With the help of Reverend Dickson's brother, Blackwell inquired into the possibility of medical study via letters, with no favorable responses. In 1847, Blackwell left Charleston for Philadelphia and New York, with the aim of personally investigating the opportunities for medical study. Blackwell's greatest wish was to be accepted into one of the Philadelphia medical schools. My mind is fully made up. I have not the slightest hesitation on the subject; the thorough study of medicine, I am quite resolved to go through with. The horrors and disgusts I have no doubt of vanquishing. I have overcome stronger distastes than any that now remain, and feel fully equal to the contest. As to the opinion of people, I don't care one straw personally; though I take so much pains, as a matter of policy, to propitiate it, and shall always strive to do so; for I see continually how the highest good is eclipsed by the violent or disagreeable forms which contain it. Upon reaching Philadelphia, Blackwell boarded with Dr. William Elder and studied anatomy privately with Dr. Jonathan M. Allen as she attempted to get her foot in the door at any medical school in Philadelphia. She was met with resistance almost everywhere. Most physicians recommended that she either go to Paris to study or that she take up a disguise as a man to study medicine. The main reasons offered for her rejection were that (1) she was a woman and therefore intellectually inferior, and (2) she might actually prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to \\"furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with\\". Out of desperation, she applied to twelve \\"country schools\\". Question: when was elizabeths pursuit of education?.

Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was apparently created to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named \\"Six\\". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with the boy, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them. She eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone.

They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames.

Although closely related, these questions are not inquiring about the same information, but rather the first is seeking specific information while the second is looking for a general method to obtain similar information. To address the first question: The zip code 39213 is located in Jackson, Mississippi. However, it is important to note that a ZIP+4 code is a more specific code that represents a particular location or address. Usually, this 9-digit code has a format like 'XXXXX-XXXX', where the first 5 digits are the traditional zip code, and the additional 4 numbers represent a specific location or delivery route within that region. Because a Zip+4 code refers to a unique location, I would require more information such as a specific street address or a PO box number in order to accurately provide the +4 extension code for 39213. As for the second question, here's a step-by-step explanation on how to find out your ZIP+4 code: 1. Begin by identifying the complete address for which you want to find the +4 extension. This should include the street address, city, state, and of course, the 5-digit zip code. 2. Visit the United States Postal Service (USPS) official website at www.usps.com. 3. Under \\"Quick Tools\\" on the USPS homepage, click on the \\"ZIP Code Lookup\\" option. 4. Once on the \\"ZIP Code Lookup\\" page, input the required address information (street, city, state), and click \\"Find\\". 5. The USPS will provide the complete 9-digit ZIP+4 code for the address you entered. It's important to note that the USPS ZIP Code Lookup tool is typically the most accurate and up-to-date source to find your ZIP+4 code since they are responsible for creating and maintaining these codes for mailing purposes. Other third-party websites may also provide this information but may not be as accurate or current as the USPS."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Negative Tone: The review has a predominantly negative tone, using strong language such as \\"exercise in bad\\" and \\"total waste of money.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the product and warns potential buyers against purchasing it. 2. Criticism of Music Quality: The reviewer specifically criticizes the music as \\"bad\\" and questions the decision to unearth the rare recordings. This criticism directly addresses the core purpose of the product - to provide enjoyable music. If the music is not enjoyable, the product is not fulfilling its primary function, which would deter potential buyers. 3. Criticism of Reproduction Quality: In addition to criticizing the music itself, the reviewer also takes issue with the reproduction quality. This suggests that the product has technical flaws, which further detracts from its value and appeal to potential buyers. 4. Disappointment with Featured Artists: The reviewer specifically mentions disappointment in the performance of Brownie McGhee, one of the featured artists. This indicates that even fans of this artist may be disappointed with the product, making it even less attractive to potential buyers. 5. Ineffective Praise: The reviewer does offer praise for the cover art, but immediately follows this with a statement that the music is the equivalent of a cold shower. This juxtaposition effectively negates any positive impact the cover art may have had, as it shows that the only positive aspect of the product is superficial and unrelated to its primary function - the music. In conclusion, this review would likely have a strong negative impact on the potential purchase decision.

Kimberly Dawn Trenor has pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge, her attorney says. Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, pleaded guilty last week to tampering with evidence in the case, but she pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge, said her attorney, Tom Stickler. Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, also faces capital murder and evidence-tampering charges, but is being tried separately and has not been arraigned.

Jurors in Trenor's trial also will determine her sentence on the evidence-tampering charge, which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison, according to The Houston Chronicle. Riley Ann's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body. Authorities were unsure of her identity, and police dubbed her \\"Baby Grace.\\" After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter.

According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24, 2007. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay. The disposal of the girl's body led to the evidence-tampering charge. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places, injuries that would have been fatal. A capital murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison, the Chronicle reported. A cross has since been erected on the island where the toddler was found, which was named Riley's Island in her honor, according to the Houston newspaper. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May 2007 to be with Zeigler, whom Trenor had met on the Internet. While in custody, Trenor gave birth this summer to another child, who is now in the care of relatives, her attorney, Tom Stickler, said. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article revolves around the murder trial of Kimberly Dawn Trenor, a 20-year-old woman, who is being accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers, and then dumping her body in a large plastic blue container in Galveston Bay in Texas. Despite having pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge, Trenor pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charges. Her husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, is also facing the same charges but is being separately tried, and his arraignment has not happened yet. Riley Ann’s remains were found in October 2007, an incident which drew considerable national attention, leading the police to dub her as \\"Baby Grace.\\" After the authorities distributed composite sketches of Riley Ann across the country, her paternal grandmother recognized her and contacted the police. A subsequent DNA test confirmed Riley's identity. According to court affidavits, Trenor confessed to the police that Riley had endured physical abuse and subsequent drowning that led to her death on July 24, 2007. She also confessed that she and her husband had kept Riley’s body in a storage shed for up to two months before disposing of it into the bay - an act that led to the evidence-tampering charge. Furthermore, a medical examiner concluded that Riley's skull had three fractures which would have caused her death. If convicted of capital murder, Trenor would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. There is a memorial cross on the uninhabited island, subsequently named Riley's Island, where the toddler was found. The article also reveals that Trenor had moved to Texas from Ohio with Riley in May 2007 to join Zeigler, whom she met online. Trenor has since given birth to another child while in custody, who is now being cared for by relatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of plants in the class Isoetopsida and order Isoetales. They are lycopods and the only genus in Isoetaceae. There are currently 192 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\", although molecular data place these species among other species of \\"Isoetes\\", so \\"Stylites\\" does not warrant taxonomic recognition. - Selaginella is the sole genus of vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae, the spikemosses or lesser clubmosses. This family is placed in the class Isoetopsida, distinguished from the sister group Lycopodiopsida (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the \\"fern allies\\". \\"S. moellendorffii\\" is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera. - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds. - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope. - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants. - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\") is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae. - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras 21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist. - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories. - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species. - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta. - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\". - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) .

A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Question: Rossman tells that any child who_will possibly be an automatic reader.

From the article, I find a relevant section where it states, \\"According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading, not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity.\\" 4. This statement directly answers the user's question. Rossman mentions that the amount of reading, around 3.5 to 4 hours per week, is the key for a child to become an automatic reader. 5. Hence, as the AI, I summarize the information from the article and provide an appropriate response by focusing on the key elements, which in this case are the number of hours a child needs to spend reading per week."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: One of the best ways to find a good fit for a new position is to consider the loyal staff that already surrounds you. Who as already put in the time required to learn company policies and earn people's trust? You'll save a lot of time if you don't have to risk hiring an outsider to fill a position. Think hard about whether someone you're working with would be right for the role, then encourage them to apply. Create a list with the help of other department leaders or administrators of the most important qualities to look for when you recruit successful staff. Discuss elements like attention to detail, experience, education level and flexibility. Your fellow managers can provide input about the qualities that will make an employee most successful and recommend someone else in the company who might be right for the job. Letting employees at your company know that you're hiring is an excellent way to recruit new candidates. You'll get referrals from people who know the company in and out, and can recommend people who will be a close fit for the job. Employees wouldn't stake their reputation on unqualified candidates, so you're sure to get some keepers if you go this route. Employees in related positions will have connections to good candidates within the industry and be able to refer friends or colleagues that will meet the job's requirements that are looking for a new job. Send staff an email that includes the job description and ask them to pass it along to people they know who are qualified. Offering incentives for employee referrals can encourage people to take your hunt for the perfect candidate seriously. Sometimes a new opening is best filled by someone from outside the company who can start with a completely fresh slate. You can still use your contacts to recruit, rather than asking for applications from complete strangers. Call up people you've worked with over the years who know you and understand what you look for in an employee. Ask them whether they have suggestions as to who might be a good candidate for the position. You can reach out to colleagues and business contacts for referrals or positive and negative reviews when you're recruiting employees. Colleagues in the industry can also advise you about a particular website or trade show that's good for finding successful employees. Scouting out great employees is one thing, but you'll need to attract the best and brightest by offering a lot in return. Here's how to light up their eyes: Play up your company culture. Tell them about what a typical day is like at your company, and give details on the company's \\"personality.\\" Talk about how much you enjoy working there. Offer a competitive salary and benefits. While this isn't always enough to guarantee you'll make the hire, it certainly doesn't hurt. Make the position sound prestigious and challenging. These two factors are big incentives for bright potential candidates. Job satisfaction comes from feeling respected and having the opportunity to learn new things and excel in the face of obstacles. Offer things other companies don't. Flex time, for example, is a highly valued benefit that many companies don't offer. Allowing people to work from home and take time off when they need it can set your company apart from the rest. Hold interview sessions periodically and retain the information of candidates that meet the requirements to be a successful employee, even if you don't have room for one right away. This will give you a pool of solid candidates to review when you have an open position. Make your pool wider and deeper by asking the candidates themselves for referrals. When you call someone on a candidate's list of references, ask about the candidate, then delve into questions on the background of the person you're talking to. You might be able to recruit the candidate's old manager. Recruit successful employees by utilizing online recruiting resources like LinkedIn, or sites specific to your industry that have profiles of people in the field. Many job seekers use these sites to find jobs that meet their skill sets. Even if someone you're interested in already has a job, there's no harm in setting up a meeting to get to know the person. You can discuss the job opening and see if they're interested. If they aren't, they might have suggestions as to who else would make a good candidate. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: To find good people for a new job position, it's important to look at your current loyal team members first. You can ask them and other managers about who might be a good fit for the role. Let your employees know about the job opening and ask them to recommend others for the job. Sometimes, talking to people outside the company can also help find good candidates. It's also important to attract great employees by telling them about how nice your company is to work for and giving them competitive pay and benefits. Keep a list of good potential workers for future job openings and use websites like LinkedIn to find more people. Remember to make the job sound prestigious and offer benefits like flex time to make your company special."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Options: (A) leave without saying goodbye (B) thank Lee (C) make some food for the homeless Answer: B","completion":"Part #1: Understand the context. Usage: Lee gave some food to the homeless people and also gave them some money. This demonstrates that Lee is a generous person who is helping the homeless in their time of need. Part #2: Identify the question being asked. Usage: What will Others want to do next? The task is asking what other people in the situation might want to do or react in response to Lee's actions. Part #3: Analyze the given options.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the word \\"read\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? She read the sky and predicted rain. The fortune teller read his fate in the crystal ball.","completion":"While at first glance, it might seem that the word \\"read\\" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, there is a subtle distinction in the way it is used in the context of each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"She read the sky and predicted rain,\\" the word \\"read\\" implies an interpretation of observable and discernible signs, such as the colors and patterns in the sky, cloud formations, direction of the wind, or any other natural indicators that point towards an upcoming change in weather. In this sense, the act of reading is focused on analyzing and making sense of the visual cues provided by nature that could signify a forthcoming rainstorm. This type of reading involves a level of experience and expertise gained by understanding the relationship between certain environmental cues and specific weather conditions. In the second sentence, \\"The fortune teller read his fate in the crystal ball,\\" the word \\"read\\" takes on a more mystical, supernatural, or esoteric meaning. Here, the fortune teller is trying to divine or reveal someone's future by peering into the depths of the crystal ball and deciphering the images or symbols they see. This form of \\"reading\\" is more rooted in the realm of spirituality and less in the empirical and observable knowledge that could be gained from interpreting real-world phenomena, as in the first sentence's context. So, while the basic action of \\"reading\\" something might seem the same in both sentences, which is the act of interpreting and extracting information from a source, the context in which they are used, the nature of the objects being read, and the methodologies applied in each case differ significantly. The first sentence relies on an understanding of the natural world and its processes, whereas the second sentence delves into the symbolic and metaphysical, attributed to supernatural or extrasensory perception. Thus, although the word \\"read\\" serves as the crux action in both sentences, the context and underlying meaning of the act of reading in each sentence are distinctly different."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

The film adaptation was released in 1956, directed by Walter Lang, and produced by 20th Century Fox. \\"The King and I\\" is set in the early 1860s and tells the story of Anna Leonowens, a British schoolteacher, who travels to Siam (now called Thailand) to serve as a governess for the many children of King Mongkut. The screenplay is based on Margaret Landon's 1944 novel \\"Anna and the King of Siam,\\" which in turn was inspired by the memoirs of the real-life Anna Leonowens. In the film, Deborah Kerr portrays Anna Leonowens with elegance, grace, and a strong-willed spirit. She is hired to educate the king's children in Western knowledge and values to help modernize Siam and allow it to compete with the international community. Anna's relationship with the King and his children is filled with cultural clashes, intellectual exchanges, and a deep mutual respect, which eventually leads to an unlikely friendship between Anna and the King. Despite Deborah Kerr's iconic performance in the movie, her singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon. However, Kerr's acting skills and chemistry with her co-star, Yul Brynner (who played King Mongkut), made her portrayal of Anna Leonowens truly memorable. \\"The King and I\\" received nine Academy Award nominations and won five, including Best Actor for Yul Brynner. Over the years, the musical has continued to hold a special place in the hearts of many viewers and is considered one of the most cherished movie musicals of all time. Some of its most famous songs include \\"Getting to Know You,\\" \\"Shall We Dance?\\" and \\"Hello, Young Lovers\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As Ferguson goes, so goes the nation. What happens to a national crisis now? As Missouri goes, so goes the nation. My history teacher taught us that when I was 16 years old. It was in Missouri, after all, where Dred Scott sued for his freedom, where the US supreme court would take up his case and declare that black men “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect”. As Ferguson goes, so goes the nation. The year 2014 taught us that. It was in Ferguson, after all, where fast-food workers at McDonald’s protested for higher wages, where the St Louis-area fry cooks get told “that’s all you deserve, that’s all you need”. It was Missouri that joined the union as a slave state on 10 August 1821, then voted against secession and remained with the union, then witnessed a bloody massacre between secessionist and union loyalists. It was Ferguson that fired the black superintendent of its schools in March, as a town with a 70% black population and a 97% white police force remained a town with an 85% white city council and a white mayor who ran unopposed, then witnessed 6% of its eligible black voters participate in the last election. Why is Ferguson, Missouri, of all places, still the bellwether for our national conversation around race and representation? Why is Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of 21,000, just now the place to bear witness to assembly, to free speech, to free press, to democracy in action? Why Ferguson? Why not Ferguson? The protests of the killing of Michael Brown began while his body lay out on the street for four hours. In the nearly two weeks since, a nation has watched a gathering of outrage as civil action. For every act of civil disobedience, Ferguson and the St Louis County law enforcement community have met the protesters with force. They brought dogs and guns, tanks and teargas. They immediately feared the black and brown citizens of their small municipality – of just 21,000 – simply because black anger and outrage frightened them. For every scared cop, there was a little war. Their reaction to the black body became a microcosm for American malice. So Ferguson is where the shit goes down. Where goes the nation now? And in Missouri, they have a questionable track record. Last year, in 86% of traffic stops and searches, 92% of those searches were of black citizens, while police officers were less likely to discover contraband on black drivers (22% black versus 34% white). In 2009, Ferguson police allegedly beat an innocent man and charged him with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms. Nearly two weeks of excessive policing and harassment in Ferguson proves that the black body in public space is still criminal before innocent. Police must replace an ex officio policy of intimidation with a show of respect for the lives of people in the communities they protect equal to that of their own. The St Louis County prosecutor appears sympathetic to law enforcement, the Ferguson mayor is in denial about any racial divisions in his town, and the governor is reticent to exert his powers to appoint a special prosecutor in responding to calls from Ferguson residents and a state senator. St Louis County, with over 90 towns and suburbs sprung from decades of housing desegregation struggles, is a balkanized republic, and law enforcement has acted as an arm to reinforce these divisions by targeting blacks citizens for crossing town lines. If a resident of Ferguson can be arrested for standing on her front lawn, what is freedom then? If a working man in Missouri can’t make it to the protest before the curfew, what good is his right to assemble? If a citizen of America is confined to a kind of house arrest where teargas seeps through the window-cracks, what does it mean to be an American anymore? And if we are a nation of laws, shouldn’t they also apply to law enforcement when they act in error? The brazen lack of transparency by authorities in Ferguson is what set tempers aflame. An unarmed 18-year-old with his hands up in surrender was shot to death by a police officer; the public simply wanted to know why, the people wanted simple accountability. In the absence of trust, we turn to federal oversight. Attorney general Eric Holder is a temporary balm to a fractured community, promising to “work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public” in “bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve”. But his justice department must do better: we don’t need a bridge – we need tectonics. The mayor of Ferguson wants to the diversify the police force, to invest in programs for schools and businesses. Community leaders and residents of Missouri engaged in civil disobedience want to use the momentum – the relative calm of the last couple nights – to nurture reflective new leaders. America wants to look in the rearview mirror and look forward at the same time. Brown will finally be laid to rest on Monday. His family will be waiting months for answers or even a charge for Darren Wilson, the man who killed their son. His American family will be doing the good and grimy work of correcting the fault lines of race and class – filling the unbridged space that was always there in all our Fergusons, all our Missouris. We will bear witness all over again, with our eyes open.

As a new probationary firefighter, Jack is assigned all the little jobs at the firehouse. Station 33 Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta), and the other veteran firefighters love to play jokes on the new rookies, including Jack. Captain Kennedy takes Jack under his wing to make him the best firefighter in the city. Time passes, and Jack is now a seasoned veteran on the rescue team. Ladder 49 has been called on a four-alarm fire to a burning 20-story building. Chief Mike Kennedy, his former Captain, is in command of the fire. Jack and the rescue team brave the fire to rescue anyone trapped inside. They save several people, and Jack continues to search for others. Jack finds a man and lowers him to safety, just before the floor collapses around him. Jack falls through the building into the middle of the inferno, and is rendered unconscious. When he awakens, Jack is able to radio to his men that he is alive. Now Jack is the one who needs to be rescued. Chief Kennedy coordinates the effort to save Jack. Awaiting rescue, Jack begins to relive his life with his wife and kids, and his career through flashbacks.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs. Question: \\"What is the physical change in temperature we see during the summer and how does it occur?\\" Response: \\"Steam rising off of a wet road after a rainstorm.\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choose from: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(b). yes. The response to the question is factually correct because the paragraph explains that during the summer, we can see steam rising off a wet road after a rainstorm. This happens because the warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly, which is a physical change in temperature. The other answer, (a), is incorrect because the response accurately describes the physical change in temperature during the summer as explained in the paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

MARIANNA, Florida (CNN) -- Leaning against his cane, Bryant Middleton shuffled toward the makeshift cemetery. Tears welled in his eyes as he leaned down to touch one of the crosses. Bryant Middleton kneels by a row of white crosses on the grounds of a former reform school he attended. \\"This shouldn't be,\\" he said. \\"This shouldn't be.\\" Thirty-one crosses made of tubular steel and painted white line up unevenly in the grass and weeds of what used to be the grounds of a reform school in Marianna, Florida. The anonymous crosses are rusting away but their secrets may soon be exposed. When boys disappeared from the school, administrators explained it away, said former student Roger Kiser. They'd say, \\"Well, he ran away and the swamp got him,\\" Kiser recalled. Or, \\"The gators got him.\\" Or, 'Water moccasins got him.\\" Kiser and other former students believe authorities will soon find the remains of children and teens sent to the Florida School for Boys half a century ago. Watch Middleton kneel by the crosses » On the orders of Gov. Charlie Crist, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement last week opened an investigation to determine if anyone is buried here, whether crimes were committed, and if so, who was responsible. A group of men in their 60s, who once attended the school, have told investigators they believe the bodies are classmates who disappeared after being savagely beaten by administrators and workers. The FDLE is just beginning its investigation, so there is no way to know if there is any truth to the allegations. The investigation will be challenging.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food. Suggested answer: Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"To verify the suggested answer, let's address the original question step-by-step. Question: How does an earthworm eat and digest food? Step 1: Understand the question To provide a relevant answer, we need to explain the process by which an earthworm ingests and breaks down food. Step 2: Address eating (ingestion) An earthworm eats by ingesting soil and organic matter through its mouth. It has a muscular pharynx that helps to suck in soil and food particles. Step 3: Address digestion Once food is ingested, it travels through the earthworm's digestive system, which includes the pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. In the crop, food is temporarily stored. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions and tiny stones ingested along with the soil help to grind the food. Once the food is ground up into smaller particles, it then enters the intestine, where enzymes break down the food molecules into even smaller molecules which can be absorbed by the earthworm's body. Step 4: Evaluate the suggested answer The suggested answer, \\"Digestion is a form of catabolism: a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones,\\" can be considered accurate as it refers to the general process of breaking down food molecules. However, it does not specifically address the process in earthworms nor how they eat, which was the main focus of the question. Answer: To properly validate an answer for this question, it is essential to mention details about how an earthworm specifically ingests and digests food. While the suggested answer is accurate regarding the general concept of digestion, it fails to address the question in the context of earthworms. Therefore, I would not validate the given answer.

Decomposition is driven by microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and small invertebrates, that break down organic matter. Step 2: Analyze the given answer \\"eukyarotes\\" Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope. They include all living organisms other than bacteria and archaea. Some eukaryotes, such as fungi, are involved in the decomposition process. Step 3: Consider further clarification While eukaryotes, specifically fungi, do play a role in decomposition, they are not the sole or primary contributor to creating compost.

Article: Saudi Arabia has reportedly told the Obama administration and congressional leaders that it will sell billions of dollars in U.S. financial assets if Congress passes a bill to make the Saudi government legally responsible for any role in the 9/11 attacks. The administration has tried to stop Congress from passing the legislation, a bipartisan Senate bill, since Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir last month told Washington lawmakers his country’s position, according to The New York Times. Al-Jubeir purportedly informed the lawmakers during a trip to Washington that Saudi Arabia would be forced to sell as much as 750 billion in Treasury securities and other American financial assets on the world market, fearing the legislation could become law and U.S. courts would then freeze the assets. The revelations about the Saudis’ ultimatum come several days after reports that President Obama will soon decide whether to declassify 28 pages of sealed documents suspected of showing a Saudi connection to the deadly 9/11 terror attacks. Former Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham told Fox News on Tuesday that the White House told him a decision on whether to declassify the documents would be made within 60 days. Graham helped lead a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks. The Bush and Obama administrations have refused to unseal the documents, arguing their release would jeopardize national security. Critics claim the reluctance is a calculated move to hide Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the al Qaeda terror attack that killed almost 3,000 people on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001. The Saudi government has said it wants the pages declassified. Obama had come under renewed pressure to release the documents ahead of a scheduled trip next week to Saudi Arabia for a summit of Persian Gulf leaders. Economists are purportedly skeptical about the Saudis making good on their vow to sell the assets, considering such a move would be difficult to execute and could severely hurt that country’s economy, which depends on the U.S. dollar. The separate 9/11 Commission essentially found no evidence that the Saudi Arabia government supported the attacks. However, the commission’s narrowly worded finding about having “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization” has skeptic suggesting that lesser officials government operatives or were involved. ||||| Saudi Arabia appears to be blackmailing the US, saying it would sell off American assets worth a 12-digit figure sum in dollars if Congress passes a bill allowing the Saudi government to be held responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The warning was delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir last month during a visit to Washington, the New York Times reported. He said his country would sell up to 750 billion in US treasury securities and other assets before the bill puts them in jeopardy. The newspaper said Riyadh's resolve to actually deliver on the threat is dubious, since selling off those assets would be technically challenging and would damage the dollar, against which the Saudi national currency is pegged. Read more Under the current US law, foreign nations have a degree of immunity from being sued in American courts. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 is one of the reasons why families of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks largely failed to bring to court the Saudi royal family and charities over suspicion of financially supporting the attacks. The bill introduced in the Senate would waiver the immunity for cases involving terrorist attacks that kill US citizens on US soil. Introduced by Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, it managed to overcome partisan divisions in the US legislation and passed without dissent through the Judiciary Committee in January. “As our nation confronts new and expanding terror networks that are targeting our citizens, stopping the funding source for terrorists becomes even more important,” Senator Cornyn said last month. Possible links between the perpetrators of the attack and Saudi Arabia may be hiding in 28 classified pages of the 2002 congressional report on 9/11, which allegedly describe how Saudi Arabian nationals with links to the government financially assisted the 19 hijackers who flew airplanes into World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Many people, including the co-author of the redacted pages, former Florida Senator Bob Graham, have been campaigning for years to make them public. The Obama administration is opposing the bill, saying it would make foreign nations retaliate by passing similar legislation and target American citizens and corporations in their national courts. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel in February that the bill, in its current form, would “expose the United States of America to lawsuits and take away our sovereign immunity and create a terrible precedent.” Read more Ironically, sovereign immunity didn't stop a US judge from last month ordering Iran to pay 10.5 billion in damages to families of the 9/11 victims. The ruling was passed because Iran didn't defend itself against the allegations. These put the blame on Iran over its links with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which, plaintiffs argued, aided Al-Qaeda. The argument is based on the same congressional report, which also said no link between the hijackers and Iran had been found. None of the 19 hijackers were Iranian citizens. Fifteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, while two were from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Egypt and Lebanon. Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter regional rivals, adhering to competing sects of Islam and battling for position in the Muslim world. The US had been a stalwart supporter of Saudi Arabia and opponent of Iran, which overthrew the US-backed Shah in 1979 and became an Islamic republic. Washington's cordial relations with Riyadh chilled somewhat as it sought a thaw with Tehran last year, participating in a deal to resolve the controversy over Iran's nuclear program. |||||Summary:","completion":"Saudi Arabia has reportedly warned the Obama administration that if Congress passes a bill that could make the Saudi government legally responsible for any role in the 9/11 attacks, it will sell billions of dollars in US financial assets.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden.

Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. A:","completion":"Jennifer would likely see more sunsets in Malarn. According to the provided information, Malarn regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean.

The question is asking what makes someone not legally able to purchase alcohol. Here's why \\"underage\\" is the best choice: 1. Underage: This option directly addresses the legal age restrictions placed on buying alcohol. In most countries, there is a minimum legal drinking age (e.g., 21 years in the United States, 18 years in the United Kingdom and Australia, 16 years in some European countries), and people below this age are considered underage. Underage individuals are not allowed to buy alcohol based on these laws aimed at protecting them from the potential negative effects of alcohol consumption. 2. Banned: Although an individual could theoretically be banned from a particular venue or location from buying alcohol, this is not inherently related to age restrictions or the legality of alcohol purchases across the board. Personal bans are usually situational and not based on a broad legal context. 3. Adult: Since adults are often legally able to purchase alcohol, selecting this option would not make sense in the context of the question. 4. Rules: While this term is somewhat relevant to the discussion of legality, it is too vague to be an accurate answer. The question is asking about a specific reason someone cannot legally buy alcohol, whereas rules could encompass many different regulations. 5. Black market: This option focuses more on the illegal sale or distribution of alcohol rather than the legal age requirement for an individual to purchase alcohol. While the black market involves the circumvention of regulations, it is not a reason or feature that disqualifies someone from legally buying alcohol as in the case of being underage. Therefore, a human would choose \\"underage\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and straightforward option that accurately explains the primary reason someone would not be legally allowed to buy alcohol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: BRIC markets grow in appeal for retailers CHICAGO (Reuters) - For global retailers that are looking to find new consumers away from their saturated home markets, the road to growth is increasingly being paved with BRICs. But Brazil, Russia, India and China -- which make up the BRIC acronym for hot emerging markets -- have differing landscapes in terms of infrastructure, regulation, consumer tastes and how well foreign companies are welcome to the markets, according to a study by Euromonitor International. That means expansion into at least some of those countries is more about creating long-term opportunities than immediate returns, Matthew Stych, director of retail research for Euromonitor, said in an interview ahead of the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit. \\"It's almost like they are putting down a place marker for future growth,\\" Stych said. In 2006, the BRIC countries accounted for 11 percent of global retail sales, up 2.4 percentage points from 2001. By the end of 2011, it is expected that the BRICs will account for almost 13 percent. \\"Brazil, Russia, China and India rank among the most attractive emerging markets, thanks to the huge size of their potential customer bases,\\" Euromonitor said in a report last month. The report also noted that the markets have grown more important as retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N: Quote, Profile, Research), Carrefour (CARR.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) and Tesco Plc (TSCO.L: Quote, Profile, Research) focus more on specific markets rather than putting down flags all over the world hoping that growth will come.

The Texans used their second possession to advance to the red zone, but a pass from Matt Schaub intended for Andre Johnson was intercepted by Chiefs safety Jarrad Page in the end zone. Beginning the second quarter, Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by quarterback Damon Huard. After a possession by the Texans, kick returner Eddie Drummond fumbled and the ball was recovered by Houston. The Texans capitalized on the turnover and scored first through a field goal. With just over six minutes left in the half, Matt Schaub completed a 77-yard pass to Andre Johnson, and the Texans secured their lead, 10-0. Beginning the third quarter, Chiefs fullback Kris Wilson appeared to have fumbled the football, although it was disputed whether or not he had possession. The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field. When the Chiefs received their first chance to score in the fourth quarter with just over five minutes remaining, they failed to capitalize on offense.

The upside of doing small tasks may get the brain flowing normally, but it is not specifically targeting the brain's sub-cortex. The focus should be on using the non-dominant hand for routine tasks to stimulate the brain better. 3. Some examples of basic chores, like taking a shower or feeding pets, do not necessarily promote the use of the non-dominant hand to challenge the brain's automatic functions.

Here's a detailed explanation as to why this occurs: Rainfall typically results from the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. As moist air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. These clouds become saturated with water droplets and, eventually, precipitation in the form of rain. The presence of rain also means that clouds are abundant, and they play a dominant role in reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground. Clouds are effective at scattering and absorbing sunlight, which leads to a decrease in the amount of direct sunlight that penetrates the cloud layer and reaches the Earth's surface. Thick rain-bearing clouds, such as cumulonimbus or nimbostratus, are particularly adept at blocking sunlight due to their high density and large water content. The decrease in sunlight during the rainy season also has several consequences on the environment: 1. Reduced solar radiation: With less sunlight reaching the ground, the amount of solar radiation available to the ecosystem reduces. This affects various natural processes that depend on sunlight, such as photosynthesis and evaporation. 2. Lower temperatures: A drop in sunlight typically corresponds to a decrease in air temperatures. This is because the Earth's surface absorbs less solar radiation, which results in less heating. Consequently, cooler temperatures are often experienced during the rainy season. 3. Altered ecosystems: Decreased sunlight availability affects the local flora and fauna in numerous ways. For example, the reduced levels of sunlight limit the growth of some plants, which may lead to changes in the species composition of the ecosystem. Additionally, the altered environment caused by the rain and decreased sunlight can affect animal behavior and population dynamics. 4. Increased humidity and reduced evaporation rates: The abundance of water vapor in the air during the rainy season already contributes to high humidity levels, but the decrease in sunlight further limits the rate of evaporation. This enhances the humid conditions in the environment, which can impact both ecosystems and human comfort. In summary, during the rainy season in a city, the amount of sunlight available is likely to decrease due to the increased cloud cover and precipitation. This reduction in sunlight has various implications on the environment, including alterations in temperature, humidity, and the functioning of ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Last month, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the hungry attention of Europe's top clubs. Such is the focus on the midfielder that 35 scouts from some of those teams -- including Manchester United and Liverpool of the English Premier League -- came to watch him at a recent Under-21 match. \\"In the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted Martin, but it's strange what you can get used to,\\" his father Hans Erik Odegaard tells CNN. \\"Almost every top European club has been in touch.\\" Hans Erik, who has so far avoided using agents to advise on his son's career, concedes that \\"the level of the Norwegian league isn't as strong as many other OPTIONS: - CNN leagues.\\" - English Premier League leagues.\\" - Europe leagues.\\" - European leagues.\\" - Hans Erik leagues.\\" - Hans Erik Odegaard leagues.\\" - Liverpool leagues.\\" - Manchester United leagues.\\" - Martin leagues.\\" - Martin Odegaard leagues.\\" - Norway leagues.\\" - Norwegian leagues.\\" - Odegaard leagues.\\" - United Arab Emirates leagues.\\"","completion":"Correct answer(s): \\"European leagues.\\" The other answers are incorrect because Hans Erik would most logically compare the level of the Norwegian league with the European leagues as a whole, not with just the English Premier League or Liverpool or Manchester United leagues, because these three are part of the bigger European Leagues.

The first points of the game came from an interception of a Favre pass, as Seattle safety Earl Thomas got to the ball ahead of wide receiver Bernard Berrian and returned it for an 86-yard touchdown. Nevertheless, Darius Reynaud returned the ensuing kickoff for 73 yards, giving Adrian Peterson the opportunity to rush 23 yards in two plays to level the scores at 7-7. Olindo Mare and Ryan Longwell then traded field goals to make the scores 10-10 at halftime. Another field goal from Mare put the Seahawks ahead on their first drive of the second half, but the Vikings responded with a 25-yard touchdown pass from Sage Rosenfels to new wide receiver Javon Walker with just over seven minutes left in the game.

During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her. Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price.

Options: - least - much - bog - lot of - big The answer is \\"big\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"big\\". In language terminology, antonyms are words that have contrasting, or opposite, meanings. Therefore, when examining the semantic connection between the words \\"little\\" and \\"big\\", we find they are antonyms. Here's why: \\"Little\\" is generally defined as small in size, amount, or degree. The term is used to depict something that is not large or significant in some way and is often used to describe physical size, amounts, and structures or items. This relates to its usage in sentences like \\"That's a little book\\" or \\"There's little food left.\\" On the other hand, the term \\"big\\" is used to describe something that is large in size, volume, amount, or degree. It represents a condition where an item or situation is considerably above the average or ordinary in scope or magnitude. This reflects its use in phrases like \\"That's a big house\\" or \\"There's a big difference between the two.\\" Therefore, by their inherent and generally accepted meanings, \\"big\\" is the correct antithetical term to \\"little\\" because it represents the exact inverse - large instead of small. Let's take a glance at the other options as well for completeness: - \\"Least\\" is not an exact antonym to \\"little.\\" \\"Least\\" is the superlative form of \\"less\\" and often suggests a lower degree or the lowest degree of something. Moreover, \\"least\\" generally does not reflect physical size, unlike \\"little.\\" - \\"Much\\" can indicate a large quantity, volume or degree of something, but it does not directly refer to physical size. Therefore, it is not as precise an antonym for \\"little,\\" which often implies small in physical dimensions. - \\"Bog\\" is a word that signifies a wet, muddy ground too soft to support a heavy body. It does not represent an antonym for \\"little.\\" - \\"Lot of\\" could mean a large amount in quantity but does not suggest anything about the physical size, making it an unsuitable direct antonym for \\"little.\\" Given this analysis, the correct answer is \\"big.\\" It mirrors the opposite meaning of \\"little\\" encompassing all its uses, particularly those referring to physical dimension, making it the most accurate choice from the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Here is a question about this article: John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation.
