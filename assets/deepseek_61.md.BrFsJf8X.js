You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? John saw Fred.","completion":"From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"John saw Fred.\\" can indeed be considered correct by the strictest standards, depending on the context and the linguistic criteria that are being applied. Let us examine the sentence more closely by breaking it down into various components and applying different linguistic perspectives. 1. Syntax: The sentence is syntactically sound, as it follows the basic structure of a declarative sentence in English: Subject (John) + Verb (saw) + Object (Fred). It also adheres to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order that is common in English sentences. 2. Morphology: Both \\"John\\" and \\"Fred\\" are proper nouns, which are capitalized and function appropriately as the subject and object of the sentence, respectively. The verb \\"saw\\" is the past tense of \\"see,\\" which accurately conveys the completed action in the past. 3. Semantics: The sentence is semantically well-formed as it has a clear meaning. \\"John,\\" the subject, is the one performing the action, while \\"Fred,\\" the object, is the one being perceived in the action. The verb \\"saw\\" effectively conveys the act of visual perception. 4. Pragmatics: Context is crucial in determining the correctness of a sentence in pragmatics. Assuming that the listener/reader already knows who John and Fred are, the sentence conveys pertinent information and appears pragmatically correct. If the identities of John and Fred have not been previously established, the sentence could be confusing, and additional information might be necessary for clearer understanding. 5. Phonology: The sentence is phonologically well-formed, as all the words are pronounced according to the standard rules of English. There are no unusual phoneme combinations that might cause pronunciation difficulties for native speakers. 6. Prescriptive vs. Descriptive: From a prescriptive standpoint, the sentence is grammatically correct according to the standard rules of English. Descriptively speaking, this sentence is also acceptable as it is a construction commonly used by English speakers in everyday communication. In conclusion, by the strictest linguistic standards and across various dimensions of language, the sentence \\"John saw Fred.\\" can be considered correct. However, it is crucial to remember that context plays a significant role in determining the correctness and appropriateness of a sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: This week Netflix surprised everyone with the news that a new eight-episode series, The OA, will premiere on Friday. Like summer megahit Stranger Things, the intriguing new show about a 20-something woman looks to combine elements of science fiction, mystery and horror. It’s also notable that the trailer dropped just a few days before The OA premieres, a show of faith that this new offering doesn’t need much hype to hook audiences. Netflix didn’t release much information about the premise, but here’s what we know so far. What it’s about: The story centers on a woman who may or may not have it together: Prairie Johnson (Brit Marling) who returns to her family seven years after she disappeared without explanation. Twist #1: when she went missing as a kid, she was blind, and now she can see. In the trailer, Prairie plays a low-key game of “what happened to me for the last seven years?” If Prairie experienced severe trauma (or even resurrection) related to her disappearance, she couldn’t see it, but she can recall people through touch. The series asks the audience to buy into the “unknown,” and Netflix describes it as a “powerful, mind-bending tale about identity, human connection and the borders between life and death.” Who’s involved: The creators are the team behind the 2013 thriller The East: Brit Marling, who stars, and Zal Batmanglij, who directs all eight episodes. And you’ve probably seen Marling’s co-stars before: Emory Cohen (Tony Fiorello in Brooklyn), Scott Wilson (Hershel Greene in The Walking Dead) and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies.) What it’s like: From what we can tell from the vibes of the trailer, this may be a strong contender to fill the gaping Stranger Things hole in your heart until the second season premieres in 2017. As Prairie’s recovers her memory, she seems to access some very supernatural experiences including that time she had a confused walkabout on a terrain that looks a lot like a video game. Like many stories about young female “science experiments” before her (Stranger Things and Firestarter anyone?) Prairie’s a small town girl participating in psychological experiments at an unethical lab, but there’s no telling how familiar it will be just yet. As far as mysteries about missing people go, it seems less horror-like than True Detective’s first season. It might also scratch the Westworld itch before that show returns in 2018. As detectives question Prairie about her disappearance, she seems to flash back to memories that will give everyone some clarity on what happened to her. Dolores much? So if hopping on a rollercoaster “who am I?” ride is your thing, then this might be your show. More cryptic hints from Netflix: All ideal icebreakers for holiday parties. Everyone will know more on Friday. Watch the full trailer above. ||||| The trailer looks spookily familiar Today we’re all watching a new trailer for The OA, a sci-fi drama and psychological thriller that drops on Netflix this Friday – and might just become a whirlwind success. The synopsis (from what we can gather from the trailer) A young woman (Prairie Johnson, played by Brit Marling) goes missing and returns to her family seven years later. At first she doesn’t recognise them. It is revealed that when she went missing she was blind; she has now miraculously gained her sight, but can only recognise her parents from touch memory. She then begins to talk about what happened when she went missing. “I didn’t disappear. I was present for all of it,” she says. The trailer cuts through clips of Prairie going through scientific experiments, slipping off the edge of a boat into the sea, running through the woods, and being spied upon through a door, revealing strange red and orange markings on her back. She rides on the back of a bicycle as the video cuts to a lorry falling from a viaduct. Cue lots of crescendo, running, blood falling backwards and, finally, the woman standing in a glass box in a house. It’s creepy as hell, and looks pretty incredible. The new Stranger Things? The sequel to Stranger Things? It’s very Stranger Things, but there’s no kid in sight. Take the scientific experimentation for example: Very reminiscent of Eleven’s sensory deprivation tank. And the bike riding. And van crashing. Familiar? This video is taken from The OA Instagram page. Dreams don't give you nosebleeds. A video posted by The OA (@the_oa) on Dec 9, 2016 at 11:31am PST Quite Eleven-like, don’t you think? Still They’ve done several collage images, taking individual Instagram squares to create a larger image. And one of those images? UPSIDE DOWN. The OA/Instagram And if this doesn’t give you Stranger Things feels, I don’t know what will. The OA/Instagram Could The OA and Stranger Things be part of the same universe? Is Prairie Johnson an adult Eleven, or another one of Papa’s experiments from the Hawkins National Laboratory? Or is The OA just piggybacking on the Netflix success of July’s spooky thriller? Either way, it’s rather exciting. READ: Stranger Things Season 2: Everything you need to know ||||| Here’s a concept: A medical mystery of a girl is seen hooked up to wires in a secretive research facility that appears to conduct high-tech mind-based experiments. The scene is contrasted by images of her running through woods and bleeding from the nose. The character in question is Prairie Johnson in Netflix’s upcoming series “The OA” ― but she’s giving us serious Eleven from “Stranger Things” vibes. (Minus the whole ‘80s thing.) Netflix announced by surprise on Monday that all eight episodes of the drama series are set for release Friday. Trust the unknown. All chapters of Netflix Original Series #theOA launch this Friday. pic.twitter.com/hTNiEPbdp9 — The OA (@The_OA) December 12, 2016 Although the streaming service produces a lot of new original content on the regular, we usually know what’s coming out when. In this case, there’s almost no information about “The OA” on Netflix ― and only some creepy hints on Twitter. Have you seen death? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016 Have you seen darkness? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016 Have you seen the light? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016 The series comes from creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, who partnered up on a environmental-themed thriller, “The East,” which premiered at Sundance in 2013. Its trailer reveals little, but sets itself apart from “Stranger Things” with somber violin music and scenes bathed in muted tones. Marling stars as Prairie, who went missing for seven years as a girl and returned as an adult with her blindness mysteriously cured. After returning home to some intense public attention, a team of men questions Prairie about her disappearance, and she undergoes some kind of memory recovery therapy. In flashes, she’s also shown running through woods and fields, jumping off a bridge, and uncovering odd markings on her back. There’s a gun, blood, and an accident on a bridge. Also appearing are Emory Cohen (Tony Fiorello in “Brooklyn”), Scott Wilson (Herschel Greene in “The Walking Dead”), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in “Harry Potter”) and Phyllis Smith (Phyllis Vance in “The Office”). So: What’s “The OA” about? We’re still not quite sure. Social media pages for the series offer only the most cryptic of hints. On Instagram, images showing pills and people hooked up to machines are peppered with messages reading “This is a dream but you’re wide awake,” “I liked it better when you were blind,” “How do we fight the cold?” and “Which way is up?” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"There's a new show on Netflix called \\"The OA\\" that is a bit mysterious and exciting.

They started off poorly again, being held scoreless in the first half. Donovan McNabb tossed three interceptions in the first three quarters, with two of them being returned for touchdowns by Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber. Trailing 17-0, McNabb found fullback Thomas Tapeh in the end zone. A short touchdown pass to Reggie Brown brought the Eagles to within three. The Bucs added a field goal, making it 20-14. With&#160;:33 left in the game, Brian Westbrook took a short pass and rumbled to a 52-yard touchdown. The point after gave the Eagles the lead, and it seemed as though they had pulled out a dramatic victory. However, a last-ditch 62-yard field goal attempt by Matt Bryant somehow made it through the uprights, robbing Philadelphia of the win. Westbrook had over 100 yards in both rushing and receiving in the defeat.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Madam President, I would like to talk about the Schengen Information System. The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a vital component of the Schengen Agreement, which allows for passport-free travel within the participating countries in Europe. This large-scale information-sharing system connects the law enforcement authorities, border control agencies, and immigration offices of the 26 Schengen Area member states. The primary objective of the SIS is to maintain public safety and security, reinforce border control, and facilitate cooperation among the participating countries, while at the same time minimizing the negative impacts of free movement within the Schengen Area. The SIS was initially established in 1995 and has evolved over time, with the implementation of the second-generation system, SIS II, in 2013. SIS II offers more advanced functionalities, such as the use of biometric data, better compatibility with other EU information systems, and a more efficiently managed technical infrastructure. Data sharing in the SIS is of utmost importance, as it enables member states to exchange critical information and alerts on individuals and objects of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, information on wanted or missing persons, criminal suspects, persons subject to entry bans, stolen or lost vehicles, and stolen or lost firearms. The system also supports the European Arrest Warrant mechanism and assists in the location and arrest of individuals sought for serious crimes or terrorism-related activities. To ensure the protection of personal data, the SIS adheres to strict data protection rules and principles. Access to the system is limited to authorized personnel, and the use of the information is restricted to the purpose for which it was entered into the system. Additionally, individuals have the right to request access to their personal data stored in the SIS, and they can ask for corrections or deletions if the data is inaccurate or has been processed unlawfully. The efficiency and effectiveness of the SIS depend on the active participation of the member states. Close cooperation, regular exchange of information, and compliance with the data protection rules are essential for the proper functioning of the system. As a testament to its importance, the SIS remains one of the most frequently used and successful information-sharing tools in Europe. It has proven to be a crucial asset in promoting cooperation between law enforcement and border control agencies and in maintaining security and safety across the Schengen Area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rugby union takes foothold in US with rise of crossover competitors There are always those who would prefer rugby union to remain untouched by progress. Think of some of the things now taken for granted that felt bold at the time: the inaugural Rugby World Cup (1987), the five-point try (1992), the advent of professionalism (1995). When people blithely trot out the cliche that rugby will never take off in the US, they do so with the same confidence the Flat Earth Society used to exude in the good old days before satellite technology spoiled everything. Look at the evidence and make up your own mind. The population of the US is more than 310 million. Olympic recognition for rugby sevens has freed up the sort of national funding that had been a distant dream. There are thousands of American footballers and basketball players who are not going to gain a professional NFL or NBA contracts but who are increasingly realising there is a global sport that potentially suits their skill set perfectly. Perhaps the most feared forward in the Premiership, Northampton's Samu Manoa, is an American international. The All Blacks are set to play a Test in the States – the likely venue is Soldier Field, Chicago – on 1 November. Stick it all together and you have a country that, one day, really could play ball with the best of them. The 60m question, surely, is when rather than if. The 2016 Olympics in Rio will have the American women's sevens team pushing for a medal. In last week's Tokyo leg of the HSBC Sevens, the American men beat Samoa and drew with the eventual champions Fiji. There are 25 rugby players training full time at the US Olympic training centre in California; the vast majority are sevens players but not exclusively so. Premiership clubs will also once again be flying out to monitor the national college sevens in Philadelphia at the end of May, an event screened by NBC Sports. A company called RugbyLaw is trying to establish a professional club tournament in the US and is holding trials in Minnesota early next month – presided over by the former Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan – for gridiron athletes keen to pursue a union career. They include a former wide receiver named Yamon Figurs, who apparently makes the American sevens blur, Carlin Isles, look pedestrian. The concept of \\"crossover\\" athletes is definitely on the rise. All it needs is for something – or someone – to stoke public interest on a wider scale. It could just happen this Saturday. If the USA Eagles defeat Uruguay in Atlanta, Georgia, they will qualify for next year's Rugby World Cup in England – in the same group as South Africa, Scotland, Samoa and Asia 1 (probably Japan), and kick-start all kinds of fresh star-spangled possibilities. The International Rugby Board believes American-based rugby supporters are already in the top three in terms of numbers when it comes to travelling abroad to watch Rugby World Cups. It does not require much imagination, should they make it to next year's tournament, to foresee Eagles fans enjoying themselves in Brighton before and after their potential opening pool game against Samoa, or relishing a trip to the Olympic Stadium, where they would be facing South Africa. Yes, the flat-earthers will say, but the Americans were stating this in the early 1990s and they are still nowhere near becoming a consistent international force. But steady on. In November, the Eagles defeated Georgia the week before their opponents beat the not inconsiderable might of Samoa. They should also have beaten an (admittedly weakened) Ireland last June and are already licking their lips at the prospect of Scotland's visit to Houston on 7 June. Admittedly, they only drew 27-27 with Uruguay in last week's first-leg qualifier, almost falling foul of their hosts' superior scrummaging muscle, but their European-based pros were still blinking away their jet lag. This week, with Northampton's Manoa, Leicester's Blaine Scully, Saracens' Chris Wyles et al able to enjoy a full week of preparation, they will fully expect to make home advantage pay. In the background, too, there is increasing private money being invested to try to strengthen the grassroots of American rugby, with some other interesting organisations doing their best to accelerate that process. Among them is Serevi Rugby, who count the former Rugby World Cup tournament manager Ross Young and the former England sevens international Ben Gollings as chief executive and lead coach respectively. Armed with corporate and private equity investment, Young and his group hope to fill the gaps that USA Rugby, presided over by the former England captain Nigel Melville, cannot always reach. \\"Until I came across I didn't realise rugby is as big as it is, especially around the smaller colleges in the US and in terms of the women's game,\\" Young says. \\"Our role is to drive awareness further, get kids involved from as young an age as possible and help provide a pathway through to national representation.\\" Representing the US at the Olympics is an obvious carrot but, stresses Young, there is also recognition that progress is not only about the top of the pyramid. \\"The long-term goal is to make rugby successful in the US. It took soccer a long while but they certainly have a strong foothold here now.\\" The thousands of Samoan and Tongan ex-pats in the Bay area of San Francisco where Manoa grew up offer obvious raw material; there is also a growing belief the spatial awareness of basketball players could make them even better rugby assets than more programmed gridiron linebackers or tightends. In the past few days, a New Zealand company, The Rugby Site, has sold its coaching modules to USA Rugby, which means any affiliated US coach can download tips from such names as Wayne Smith, Joe Schmidt and Richie McCaw to a mobile phone and instantly use them at training. The rugby world is changing fast. So, no pressure on the Eagles to get the job done in Atlanta this Saturday. \\"Rugby World Cup qualification is massively important,\\" Young says. \\"NBC showed the 2011 tournament on terrestrial television for the first time and there's talk about them doing more. They've put on Premiership games prior to Premier League football on a Saturday morning. Sport is hugely aspirational over here and success at national level is crucial.\\" It might take another two decades for the American dream to be realised fully but to insist it will never happen in a million years is the kind of nihilistic thinking rugby union needs to eradicate. No one could fail to wish Jonny Wilkinson all the best when he finally hangs up his boots – and kicking tees – at the end of the season. After all the injuries he has sustained, no modern player is more deserving of the luxury of picking his preferred time to go. The only faint alarm bells surround what precisely he will do next. He is brilliant with children and would make a brilliant Beckham-esque role model/ambassador but Leigh Halfpenny's kicking coach at Toulon? There are some superfluous jobs in the world and that would definitely be one of them. Leinster v Munster, Northampton v Leicester … who said the Six Nations has a monopoly on tribal passion? With our regular hutch-based expert suspended until May following allegations of possible irregular carrot consumption, this is a week for big statements from anyone with aspirations of Heineken Cup quarter-final glory next month. Few are more practised at refocusing at this time of year than Leinster and Leicester … and look out for Niki Goneva, the Tigers' winger, who is as dangerous with ball in hand as anyone in Europe. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Rugby union, a sport played with a ball where two teams try to score by running, passing, and kicking, is becoming more popular in the United States. This is because many American football and basketball players who won't play professionally in the NFL or NBA can use their skills in rugby instead. With more people and money supporting rugby in the US, it is possible that one day the American team could compete with the best teams in the world. The US rugby team's success could inspire more kids to start playing and grow the sport even more in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background Paragraph: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height.

Please answer the following question: Q: What is the role of the sodium ion in the neutralization reaction of sodium flouride? Choices: - reflection ion - circuit ion - team ion - spectator ion A: Answer:","completion":"The role of the sodium ion in the neutralization reaction of sodium fluoride is as a spectator ion. In a neutralization reaction, an acid and a base react to form a salt and water. Sodium fluoride is a salt formed from the reaction of a strong acid, hydrofluoric acid (HF), and a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The reaction can be represented as: HF + NaOH → NaF + H2O In this reaction, the sodium ion (Na+) doesn't directly participate in the neutralization process. The actual neutralization occurs between the hydroxide ion (OH-) from the base and the hydrogen ion (H+) from the acid, forming water (H2O). The sodium ion (Na+) and the fluoride ion (F-) are paired together in the product, forming the salt sodium fluoride (NaF). Thus, the role of the sodium ion (Na+) in this reaction is that of a spectator ion, meaning it is present during the reaction but does not directly participate in the formation of the product.

In 1959 King got to know Sonny Thompson, a pianist, producer, and A&R man for Cincinnati's King Records. King's owner, Syd Nathan, signed King to the subsidiary Federal Records in 1960. King recorded his debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" backed with \\"You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling\\" (again credited as \\"Freddy\\" King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in Cincinnati, Ohio, King cut the instrumental \\"Hide Away,\\" which the next year reached number 5 on the R&B chart and number 29 on the Pop chart, an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental at a time when the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. It was originally released as the B-side of \\"I Love the Woman\\". \\"Hide Away\\" was King's melange of a theme by Hound Dog Taylor and parts by others, such as \\"The Walk\\", by Jimmy McCracklin, and \\"Peter Gunn\\", as credited by King. The title of the tune refers to Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago. Willie Dixon later claimed that he had recorded King performing \\"Hide Away\\" for Cobra Records in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced. \\"Hide Away\\" became a blues standard. After their success with \\"Hide Away,\\" King and Thompson recorded thirty instrumentals, including \\"The Stumble,\\" \\"Just Pickin',\\" \\"Sen-Sa-Shun,\\" \\"Side Tracked,\\" \\"San-Ho-Zay,\\" \\"High Rise,\\" and \\"The Sad Nite Owl\\".

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

This is some data: Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Finland; Finland, demonym, Finns; Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Helsinki; Finland, leader, Sauli Niinistö. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided offers significant information about the Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker, its construction, the country of Finland and its leader, Sauli Niinistö. Let's breakdown this information into a comprehensive and detailed description. 1. Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker): Aleksey Chirikov is an icebreaker ship named after Aleksey Chirikov, the 18th-century Russian explorer who played a crucial role in mapping the Alaskan coast. Icebreakers are specialized vessels designed to navigate and break through ice-covered waters, enabling the movement of other vessels in frozen regions like the Arctic and Antarctic. The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker specifically is built with reinforced hulls, powerful engines, and a unique hull shape, giving it the necessary force to break and push through thick ice. 2. Builder, Finland: The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker was built in Finland, a Nordic country with a long history and experience in shipbuilding, particularly icebreakers. Finland is known for expertly blending advanced engineering and technology to create top-tier icebreakers, and their shipbuilding industry is highly acclaimed globally. Finnish icebreakers are sought after for their state-of-the-art designs and capabilities, making Finland a key player in the shipbuilding market. 3. Finland and its people: Finland, officially the Republic of Finland, is situated in Northern Europe, sharing borders with Sweden, Norway, and Russia. It's famous for its thousands of lakes, massive stretches of forests, and excellent education system. The people of Finland are called Finns, who are known for their hospitality, resilience, and strong cultural identity. The Finnish culture is rich, with historic influences from the East and West due to its geographical location. The country’s official languages are Finnish and Swedish, with a small minority speaking native languages like Sami and Romani. 4. Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Helsinki: The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker was constructed in the city of Helsinki, Finland's capital, and largest city. Helsinki is located on the southern coast of Finland, and it's an economic and political hub with over 1.4 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area. The city is home to several major shipyards, green spaces, museums, and a thriving startup scene. Helsinki's location near the Baltic Sea has facilitated the growth of its maritime industry, and as a result, it has become a leading center for shipbuilding, including icebreakers like Aleksey Chirikov. 5. Leader, Sauli Niinistö: Sauli Väinämö Niinistö is the current leader and 12th President of Finland, serving since 2012. Niinistö is a seasoned Finnish politician and a member of the National Coalition Party. Prior to his presidency, he has held multiple political positions, such as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. As the President, Niinistö's responsibilities include overseeing foreign policy, representing Finland at the international level, and ensuring the country's stability and welfare. His presidency has been marked by a focus on economic growth, environmental conservation, and forging stronger ties with the European Union and NATO. Niinistö's role in governing Finland is crucial for maintaining its social, economic, and political balance and ensuring the country's continued growth and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program \\"Blackbriar\\" to make super assassins like himself. I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall and Supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense. Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense! Even when you know Bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. It's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in Transformers. Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (Don't ask). The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over. The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character \\"Nicky\\" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in Ultimatum (better script). I am reminded of a scene in \\"Goldeneye\\" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond film) in which Sean Bean's character asks James if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. Albeit, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything. Sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA, Interpol, and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes, that Bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? If you have a pulse and love action movies, than Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. It kind of drags a touch near the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook that.

Q:Information: - \`\` Der gute Kamerad '' ( \`\` The good Comrade '' ) , also known by its incipit as Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden ( \`\` I had a comrade '' ) is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces . The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ?

Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss. - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\". - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures. - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787 13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Step 4: The Journey and Obstacles The team must travel through perilous territory teeming with sentinel patrols, undetected, to reactivate the weapon before the 72-hour deadline is up. They face numerous challenges along the way, including battles with sentinels, encounters with hostile human factions, and traversing dangerous landscapes. Step 5: Race Against Time As the team gets closer to their goal, the challenges become graver, and the losses more significant. The team loses members in their desperate race against time, and the sentinels are closing in on Zion. In the final moments, the remaining team members reach the weapon and face their final challenges – to activate the weapon and save Zion. Step 6: Climactic Battle and Resolution In the climax, the team encounters the leader of the sentinels, a hyper-intelligent AI construct determined to eliminate Zion. The climactic battle ensues, and Alex's team manages to activate the weapon, unleashing a powerful EMP blast that destroys the approaching sentinel army. Zion is saved, but at a great cost. Step 7: Concluding the Movie In the aftermath, the fallen team members are honored, and the survivors remain vigilant, knowing that the fight against the AI would continue. The people of Zion live to fight another day, and Alex remains a beacon of hope in their ongoing struggle for human survival.

Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility.

The Afghan Hound is a highly distinctive breed, set apart by its thick, fine, and silky coat, as well as its tail, which features a ring curl at the end. This breed was selectively bred for these unique qualities that have not only made it an admired and sought-after breed but also allowed the dogs to survive and thrive in their native environment. The Afghan Hound traces its origins back to the cold mountains of Afghanistan. The country's harsh and rugged terrain, often marked by frigid temperatures, necessitated the development of specific physical characteristics in these dogs. For instance, their thick and silky coat serves as insulation, protecting them from the cold and allowing them to stay warm even in the elevated and mountainous regions of Afghanistan. Simultaneously, the coat's length and texture offer an effective camouflage, enabling the Afghan Hounds to blend into their surroundings while hunting. The origin of the Afghan Hound is believed to date back thousands of years, making it one of the most ancient dog breeds in existence. These dogs were bred primarily for their hunting prowess, speed, and agility. The breed's ability to navigate the challenging topography and elevation of its native Afghan mountains, along with its keen sense of sight, made it a valuable hunting companion. The Afghan Hounds were originally used for hunting large animals such as gazelles, hares, and even leopards in the region. As time progressed, the Afghan Hound transcended its role as a hunting dog in Afghanistan and became symbolic of class and nobility. Esteemed Afghan tribes and upper-class families took great pride in possessing these proficient, elegant, and regal canines. Moreover, the Afghan Hound gained popularity worldwide, particularly among dog enthusiasts and breeders who admired its striking appearance and unique qualities. In conclusion, Viscount Grant, also known as Gable, who won the Best In Show title at the Crufts dog show in 1987, belonged to the Afghan Hound breed, originally developed in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. These impressively agile and resilient dogs were selectively bred for their distinctive traits, such as their fine, silky, temperature-regulating coat and curled tail, which facilitated their survival and performance in their harsh native environment. The prestigious history and characteristics of the Afghan Hound breed have ensured its continued popularity and admiration in the dog world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: The Northern Council of Mosques, representing 400 mosques, says this \\"encroaches\\" on religious freedom. The Muslim supplementary schools would have to comply with plans for tighter scrutiny over \\"out-of-school education settings\\" if the plans were introduced. The government's consultation on the proposals closes on Monday. And the Department for Education has indicated that it makes \\"no apology\\" for wanting to ensure children are properly protected. David Cameron has warned that \\"teaching intolerance\\" had to be stopped. But in a response, the mosque leaders say the plans are based on \\"the flawed assumption that radicalisation takes place within some madrassas\\" and that such \\"control and monitoring\\" over lessons would \\"effectively lead to a form of state sanctioned religious expression\\". They say the registration and inspection plan \\"unduly encroaches on the legitimate right of faith providers to teach their children their faith\\". The mosque leaders also take issue with the use of the term \\"extremism\\" saying it is vaguely defined and \\"potentially all-encompassing\\". In his speech to the Conservative party conference, the prime minister called for such places of religious education to be registered and open to inspection, in a speech warning against the risk of extremist teaching. He claimed that in some madrassas, children were \\"having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate\\". This was followed by plans from the Department for Education for the compulsory registration of out-of-school places of education, such as madrassas, which currently operate outside of the oversight of the authorities. It would give inspectors powers to ensure that children were \\"properly safeguarded\\" and would allow sanctions to be imposed, such as barring individuals from teaching or shutting down such centres where failings were found. As well as stopping \\"unsuitable staff\\" and \\"undesirable teaching\\" it would mean preventing corporal punishment. Such regulation would apply to places where children were regularly taught six to eight hours a week - and not to occasional or less frequent sessions. But the Northern Council of Mosques, with a membership in places such as Bradford, Manchester and Rochdale, says such an approach will be counter-productive and will \\"alienate\\" faith groups. The mosque group say that young people need to be able to debate ideas openly and \\"faith providers may simply avoid such open conversations with children for fear of being labelled extremists themselves\\". There are believed to be about 2,000 madrassas in the UK. They teach Muslim children subjects such as Arabic to recite the Koran and lessons in the principles and practices of their faith. A Department for Education spokesman said: \\"We recognise many out-of-school education settings do a great job in supporting children's education and development but, without proper oversight, there is a risk that some children attending them may be exposed to harm, including from extremism. \\"We want to hear the views of all interested parties about how settings which children attend intensively might be required to register so that they can be inspected in a way that does not place unnecessary burdens on good providers.\\" As well as extra scrutiny for part-time, out-of-school settings, Ofsted has called for illegal, unregistered schools to be shut down. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said inspectors had found \\"squalid\\" conditions in places teaching children for more than 20 hours a week, which were not registered or accountable to inspectors, local authorities or the Department for Education.","completion":"The Northern Council of Mosques, which represents 400 mosques, has criticized plans by the UK government to regulate and inspect madrassas (Islamic religious schools) as an infringement on religious freedom. The Department for Education intends to introduce tighter scrutiny over \\"out-of-school education settings\\" in an effort to ensure children are properly protected and prevent the teaching of intolerance. However, mosque leaders argue that such control and monitoring would lead to state-sanctioned religious expression and unduly encroach on the right of faith providers to teach their faith. Furthermore, they claim that the term \\"extremism\\" is vaguely defined and potentially all-encompassing. The Northern Council of Mosques warns that the proposed regulations could alienate faith groups and discourage open conversations about ideas for fear of being labeled as extremists.

Translate this to English?","completion":"To begin with, generally, the lessee (lease-purchaser) selects the equipment from the supplier (lease-seller). Allow me to provide an elaborative explanation of this statement: In the context of this statement, a lease agreement is being discussed. A lease agreement is a contract between two parties, the lessor (lease-seller) and the lessee (lease-purchaser), in which the lessor allows the lessee to use an asset (in this case, equipment) in exchange for periodic payments. The lessor retains ownership of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use it. In most lease agreement scenarios, the lessee (lease-purchaser) starts by choosing the equipment they need from the supplier (lease-seller). The supplier, who could be a manufacturer or a distributor of the required equipment, allows the lessee to use it in exchange for regular payments made over the agreed lease term. Selecting the equipment from the supplier is a crucial step for the lease-purchaser as it ensures that they choose the most suitable equipment to fulfill their business needs, preferences, or requirements. The type of equipment can vary from vehicles, machinery, and tools, to IT equipment like computers, telephones, and servers - depending on the lease-purchaser's industry and specific requirements. Once the equipment is selected, the lease-purchaser typically enters into a lease agreement with the lease-seller. This agreement outlines the specific terms and conditions, including the duration of the lease, the amount and frequency of payments, the responsibilities of both the lessor and lessee, and provisions for termination, renewal, or purchase at the end of the lease term. Moreover, it is essential for both the lease-purchaser and the lease-seller to clearly understand and communicate their respective obligations in the lease agreement. This will help prevent any potential misunderstandings, conflicts, or issues that may arise during the course of the lease term. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Pour commencer, généralement, le preneur à bail (loueur-acheteur) choisit le matériel chez le fournisseur (loueur-vendeur)\\" emphasizes the initial step in a lease agreement, where the lease-purchaser selects the desired equipment from the lease-seller or supplier before proceeding with the contractual agreement. This process ensures that both parties are aware of the equipment involved and can agree upon the terms and conditions of the lease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","completion":"The Blue Lagoon is a popular cocktail that includes the alcoholic spirit vodka as its primary ingredient. The cocktail is known for its striking blue color, which is achieved by the combination of vodka, blue curaçao liqueur, and lemonade or lemon-lime soda. The blue curaçao is what gives the drink its unique color and adds a slightly sweet, orange flavor to the mix. The classic Blue Lagoon cocktail recipe typically consists of the following ingredients: 1. Vodka: Vodka serves as the base spirit for this cocktail, providing a clean and neutral flavor profile. Although any vodka brand will work, it is recommended to use a good-quality vodka for a smoother taste. The standard measurement is around 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of vodka per cocktail. 2. Blue Curaçao: This Caribbean liqueur is made from the dried peels of the Laraha citrus fruit, which is a close relative of the Valencia orange. Its distinctive blue color comes from food coloring, while its flavor is a blend of bitter orange and sweet citrus. You will need approximately 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of blue curaçao for a Blue Lagoon. 3. Lemonade or Lemon-Lime Soda: Both lemonade and lemon-lime soda work well as mixers in this cocktail, providing a tangy citrus note that complements the vodka and blue curaçao. Depending on your preference, you may opt for a still or sparkling lemonade. Alternatively, a lemon-lime soda such as Sprite or 7-Up can also be used for added fizz. About 4 ounces (120 milliliters) of the chosen mixer will give the right balance to the cocktail. 4. Optional Garnish: For a sophisticated presentation, you can garnish the Blue Lagoon with a lemon wheel, a slice of orange, or even a maraschino cherry. Adding a straw or a stirrer will enhance the overall look and make it easier to mix and enjoy the cocktail. To prepare a Blue Lagoon, follow these steps: 1. Fill a highball or Collins glass with ice cubes. 2. Add the vodka and blue curaçao to the glass. 3. Pour in the lemonade or lemon-lime soda, leaving enough space for the garnish. 4. Stir gently to combine the ingredients. 5. Add your desired garnish to the cocktail. 6. Serve immediately and enjoy. Since its creation, the Blue Lagoon has become a popular cocktail choice, especially during the summer months, thanks to its refreshing taste and vibrant appearance. You can also experiment with variations, such as replacing the vodka with gin or combining different liqueurs, to create your personalized version of the classic Blue Lagoon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Establish the setting and the characters' lives The movie is set in a bustling Indian metropolis where all three Laxminarayans live in different neighborhoods, unaware of each other's existence. The undergarments salesman works in a busy marketplace, the car salesman runs a successful showroom, and the wannabe gangster is in a street gang committing petty crimes. Each Laxminarayan has his own dreams and aspirations. Step 3: Introduce the inciting incident A wealthy businessman named Mr. Kapoor acquires a rare and valuable artifact that several criminal organizations want to obtain. To retrieve this artifact, they approach the three Laxminarayans, each believing them to be a different contact person due to name confusion. Step 4: Develop separate plotlines for each Laxminarayan The first Laxminarayan is mistaken for a well-connected criminal due to his knowledge of concealed undergarments used by criminals to hide weapons. The car salesman Laxminarayan crosses paths with a mob boss who asks him to help smuggle some cars containing hidden loot. Meanwhile, the wannabe gangster's street gang gets the opportunity of a lifetime when they're asked to pull off a heist, thanks to his new, yet mistaken reputation. Step 5: Merge the three plotlines into one The three Laxminarayans individually start getting entangled in various criminal schemes related to the artifact, and soon, their paths cross.

Step 6: Create conflict and climax In the climax, the three Laxminarayans realize that they've been mistaken for one another and decide to join forces to outwit the criminal organizations. As they devise a plan, they leverage their unique strengths and professions to concoct a scheme that has the various criminal organizations turning against each other. While the criminals are distracted, they manage to get their hands on the artifact and escape. Step 7: Tie up loose ends and conclude the story In the end, the three Laxminarayans decide to form a bond and become their own crime-busting team, leveraging their new skills and connections in the underworld. They give the artifact back to Mr. Kapoor and receive a sizable reward.

Continuing the story: More children were playing checkers than were playing chess because the chess game was harder to learn. The children found the rules of checkers to be more straightforward, with simple moves and basic objectives. Chess, on the other hand, had many layers of complexity with each piece having its unique movement patterns and strategic importance. Step 1: Assess the choices given I compared the two options and considered the logic behind them. Chess is a widely known and accepted game, which has a steeper learning curve than checkers. Therefore, it is more likely that a higher number of children would opt to play checkers over chess. Step 2: Choose the appropriate continuation I chose answer 'a' as it was the most logical and accurate continuation of the given story. The fact that chess is more challenging to learn aligns with the notion that more children would be playing checkers in this particular scenario.

Firstly, the reviewer starts off by praising the restaurant, referring to it as \\"one of the best places to eat Asian food with a western twist.\\" This statement indicates that the reviewer appreciates the unique blend of cuisines offered by the establishment, which sets it apart from other Asian food options. The use of \\"best\\" denotes a high level of satisfaction and endorsement, contributing to the overall positive sentiment. Another aspect of the review that supports the positive sentiment is the mention of the dish sizes. While the reviewer notes that the portion sizes are small, they do not present this as a negative factor. Instead, the contrast is made to \\"all you can eat\\" dining experiences, suggesting that the restaurant's smaller, more satisfying portions are distinctive and worth the visit. The comment on the prices only mildly detracts from the overall positive sentiment; the reviewer describes the prices as \\"OK\\" and within an acceptable range for the dining experience. The use of the phrase \\"very bite is special\\" serves to balance the sentiment about the price, as it conveys the idea that the quality and the culinary experience provided by the restaurant justify the cost per person. Finally, the fact that the reviewer is leaning towards a positive sentiment as their choice further reinforces that the overall sentiment of the review is positive. They are essentially stating that despite the caveats mentioned, they still appreciate the dining experience and would likely recommend the restaurant to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continental Europe uses similar phrases, such as Sommerzeit in Germany, zomertijd in Dutch-speaking regions, kesäaika in Finland, horario de verano or hora de verano in Spain and heure d'été in France, whereas in Italy the term is ora legale, that is, legal time (legally enforced time) as opposed to \\"ora solare\\", solar time, in winter.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"William Willett.

Step 2: Extract relevant information from the context - Review the context provided and pinpoint the essential information. Here, it mentions Willett's 1907 proposal used the term daylight saving, and later term summer time replaced daylight saving time.

OPTIONS: + World. + Sports. + Business. + Science/Tech.","completion":"This topic is about: + Business. The information given revolves around the financial market and macroeconomic aspects, specifically related to U.S. Treasury debt prices and oil prices. The impacts of oil prices on the economy and monetary policy fall under the business news category, which covers finance, the market, and its corresponding consequences on the global economy. The news article mentioned above highlights the relationship between oil prices and the U.S. Treasury debt prices. Investors are taking into account the potential side effects of near-record high oil prices on the economy. The higher the price of oil, the higher the cost of production and transportation, which might slow economic growth. This could affect businesses' ability to generate profits, repay loans, and create new employment opportunities. High oil prices also result in higher inflation which impacts consumer purchasing power and indirectly affects the overall economy. In response to these concerns, investors are likely to divert their investments from riskier assets to the relatively safer and less volatile U.S. Treasury debt securities, in anticipation of stalled monetary tightening. Monetary tightening occurs when central banks raise interest rates or adopt other strategies to reduce money supply in order to control inflation. When the economy is slowed down, central banks may refrain from tightening monetary policy to support economic growth. In this context, the relationship between oil prices and U.S. Treasury debt prices can be considered a vital topic under business news. The effects of such market activities influence investment decisions and monetary policies, and help paint a clear picture of how different aspects of the financial market and the economy are interconnected."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds: As the compounds spread through the atmosphere, they mix with water droplets and particles in clouds. 4. The affected rain falls to the earth: The polluted water droplets combine and fall back to the ground as rain, now containing the incorporated chemical compounds. 5. The affected rainwater accumulates in bodies of water and soil: After falling to the ground, the rainwater either infiltrates the soil or contributes to surface water in streams, rivers, and lakes. This infused water can impact the surrounding ecosystems and pose potential risks to human health. This is the final step in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","completion":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. Step 1: Understand the problem - The problem states that Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months and gained a lot of weight. - Group Yellow had a normal diet. - Obesity occurs when the BMI is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. Step 2: Determine the relationship between calories and BMI - A surplus of 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. - Increased body fat can contribute to a higher BMI. Step 3: Analyze the dietary habits of each group - Group Brown consumed a significant amount of extra calories daily, leading to increased body fat and a higher likelihood of reaching or exceeding a BMI of 30.0. - Group Yellow had a normal diet, so they are less likely to have an excessive calorie intake that would lead to increased body fat and a BMI greater than 30.0. Conclusion: Based on their dietary habits, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0 compared to Group Brown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To allow supplies into Paris, one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over. Favre was unaware that the real aim of Bismarck in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on the new western frontier of Germany, preferably by a peace with a friendly government, on terms acceptable to French public opinion.

From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\". - The Second Polish Republic, also known as the Second Commonwealth of Poland or interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (19181939).

Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west. - The Soviet Armed Forces, also called the Armed Forces of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Armed Forces of the Soviet Union (Russian: \\"Vooruzhonnyye Sily Soyuza Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik\\", ) refers to the armed forces of the Russian SFSR (19171922), and Soviet Union (19221991) from their beginnings in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War to its dissolution in December 1991. - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

This House would ban junk food from schools. What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to this debate is that banning junk food from schools can be a good idea. This is because eating too much junk food, like chips, candy, and soda, is not healthy for kids. Having healthier options, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can help them grow strong and stay focused in class. If schools stop selling junk food, it can also teach kids the importance of making good choices when it comes to food. So, by not having junk food at school, we are helping kids to feel better and learn better too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They both convey the same information, which is that the individual being referred to was drafted in the second round of the 2012 WNBA draft as the 20th overall pick by the Minnesota Lynx. Paraphrasing is the act of expressing the same idea or concept using different words, phrases, or sentence structures, while maintaining the original meaning. In this case, both sentences convey the same idea but are expressed slightly differently: 1. \\"It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx.\\" 2. \\"She was selected in the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (20th overall) by the Minnesota Lynx.\\" The differences between the sentences include: a) The use of the pronoun \\"It\\" in the first sentence, as opposed to \\"She\\" in the second sentence. Though both pronouns refer to the same individual, \\"She\\" makes it clear that the individual is a woman, which fits appropriately in the context of the WNBA. b) The placement of the year \\"2012\\" in the first sentence comes after the phrase \\"WNBA draft,\\" while in the second sentence it is placed before \\"WNBA Draft.\\" This is a minor variation in the structure of the sentence but does not change the meaning. c) Lastly, capitalization slightly differs between the two sentences where \\"WNBA Draft\\" is capitalized in the second sentence, while in the first sentence \\"draft\\" is not capitalized. Again, this difference is minimal and does not alter the meaning of the sentence. Despite these small differences, the core information in both sentences is identical, indicating that they are paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

There was also a report of delays in both directions on the Green and Yellow lines because of a medical emergency at the Fort Totten stop. Trains are sharing a track between the Georgia Avenue and Fort Totten stops. Metro said it expects to have the broken rail near the East Falls Church station fixed by noon Tuesday. The broken rail caused some delays in the snowy morning commute. Crews were on the scene and working to install “splice bars,” according to Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. Once that piece is installed, he said, test trains will be run through the area and normal service will resume at that point. Trains are sharing a track through the East Falls Church stop on the Orange and Silver lines as a result of the problem. Stessel said the broken rail is likely weather-related. At times, rails crack when outside temperatures fluctuate from warm to very cold. Metro said trains continue to share a track through the East Falls Church stop on the Orange and Silver lines.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Jason Gilbert Giambi (; born January 8, 1971) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. In his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, which began in 1995, he played for the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies and Cleveland Indians. Giambi was the American League MVP in 2000 while with the Athletics, and is a five-time All-Star who led the American League in walks four times, in on-base percentage three times, and in doubles and in slugging percentage once each, and won the Silver Slugger Award twice. Giambi has publicly apologized for using performance-enhancing drugs during his career. Late in 2003, Giambi was named by FBI officers investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) as being one of the baseball players believed to have received anabolic steroids from trainer Greg Anderson. In December 2004, the San Francisco Chronicle reported it had seen Giambi's 2003 grand jury testimony in the BALCO investigation. The newspaper said that in his testimony, Giambi admitted to using several different steroids during the off-seasons from 2001 to 2003, and injecting himself with human growth hormone during the 2003 season. In a press conference prior to the 2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison. Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same. \\"I was wrong for using that stuff\\", he told USA Today. \\"What we should have done a long time ago was stand up--players, ownership, everybody--and said, 'We made a mistake.'\\" When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: \\"Maybe one day I'll talk about it, but not now.\\" Giambi did speak with George J. Mitchell, after being forced to do so by Bud Selig. Subsequently, in December 2007, the Mitchell Report included Giambi along with his brother Jeremy Giambi, who also admitted to using steroids during his career. The prosecution in the Barry Bonds perjury case indicated they intended to call both Jason and Jeremy Giambi to testify against Bonds in his March 2009 trial.","completion":"This text is about Jason Gilbert Giambi, a former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for teams like Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies, and Cleveland Indians.

We characterized the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 SSB (PaSSB) by using fluorescence quenching measurements and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). Analysis of purified PaSSB by gel filtration chromatography revealed a stable tetramer in solution. In fluorescence titrations, PaSSB bound 22-32 nucleotides (nt) per tetramer depending on salt concentration. Using EMSA, we characterized the stoichiometry of PaSSB complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers, and the size of the binding site was determined to be 29 ± 1 nt. Furthermore, EMSA results indicated that the dissociation constants of PaSSB for the first tetramer were less than those for the second tetramer.

This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life. In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool's Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been dealt with under this scheme, have not committed a second crime. However, this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem. Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer. This hard-boiled character is a role typical of Baker. Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events, back to his original investigation. His first case leads him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by real-life brother and sister duo), who have committed a petty theft. Here he meets Cathie (satisfyingly portrayed by Anne Heywood) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with. It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums. McCallum does an eye-catching turn as the Americanized mixed-up kid, who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando, than any previous British star. One is reminded of Brando's character Johnny from 'The Wild One' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'Johnny' leads his gang. Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as 'The Blue Lamp' is not so apparent. Instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the forefront. The plot, whilst at times predictable, does deliver some memorable scenes. The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music, leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant. The most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny. Obviously in the light of the real-life Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying. Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review seems to have a mostly positive view of the movie. It praises the well-drawn characters, memorable scenes, and the departure from the preachiness of earlier crime dramas.

Article: The researchers, led by Hwang Woo-suk, insist they cloned an Afghan hound, only to help investigate human disease, including the possibility of cloning stem cells for treatment purposes. But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther. \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago. Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed. Uncertainties about the health and life span of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis. Wilmut and others _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\" The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted with more than 1,000 cloned embryos. In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea.

Write some highlights for the following article: Scientists have mapped the quietest places in America, as well as some of the noisiest. Researchers from the National Park Service collected more than 1.5million hours of acoustical monitoring data from around the country and found that the quietest areas were in national parks. The team found sound levels that are as quiet as before European colonization in some wild places of the country, according to Science. Scientists from the National Park Service used a computer program to map the noise levels throughout the entire country. This map shows the combined decibel levels from both natural and human-made noise, which ranged from below 30 decibels to above 60. National parks, such as Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, were the quietest places in the entire country, with low levels of human noise. While the most peaceful places saw less than 20 decibels of background noise on a typical summer day, places such as New York City can average up to 60 decibels. The map shows a stark difference between the noisy eastern half of the country and the West, where large swaths of land see measurements below 30 decibels. Noise is measured logarithmically in decibels, with a jet engine around 100 decibels, an office environment measured at about 60 and a whisper at 20. The quietest places in the US are found at the Rockies and westward, with secluded areas such as Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado leading the way. Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii was also among the quietest, lead author Dr Daniel Mennitt told Daily Mail Online. Urban environments and towns along the interstate system got the noisiest ratings, according to maps from a study by Dr Mennitt, Dr Ken Fristrup and Dr Lisa Nelson. Researchers have previously pointed out how long-term exposure to loud background noise can cause health problems. Dr Fristrup has said that constant noise may be creating a 'deaf generation' that is unable to use our bodies' ability to hear sounds far away. The researchers also made a map of the country's noise if humans were taken out of the equation (above). Large amounts of natural noise, which was mapped on a smaller scale than the total noise, was found in areas with rivers and insects, such as the Southeast. The naturally noisiest parts of the country include the area around the Mississippi River (pictured) while naturally quiet places were generally high,dry shrubland. However, the difference between the bustling East and the more peaceful West was not only limited to areas with large amounts of human development. A map of sounds created by natural sources, where scientists redid the map as if there were no people, also shows a country split in half. Warm areas in the Southeast and interior Midwest saw high values and appear in yellow, though the scale for the amount of noise is smaller than for when human sounds are included. Non-human noise came mostly from running water, rain and 'wind-induced vegetation sounds'. The wetlands and area around the Mississippi River also support a huge amount of wildlife and the constant buzz of insects can be heard even in areas with few or no people. Humans' contribution to the noise levels were mapped by subtracting the natural levels from the soundscape (seen above). Even areas without large human populations saw man-made noise from roads and airplanes flying overhead. Big cities such as New York (pictured) can see background noise levels as high as 60 decibels, roughly the same as an office environment or a conversation in a restaurant. The quietest places in terms of natural sounds were high, dry shrubland and barren, flat terrain'. Dr Mennitt and his team then measured the affect that humans have on the soundscape by finding the difference between the total noise and natural noise levels. Even remote spots saw some man-made noise, with the rumble of aircraft overheard destroying the natural stillness. Other patches of would-be quiet were also broken up by roads or other transportation networks. One aircraft can be heard 25 miles from from its path and cars can be heard six miles from the road, the study said. The largest areas without large amounts of unnatural noise were the Adirondacks in northern New York state and parts of the Rocky Mountains. Half of 'low impact' areas were in protected lands. The scientists were unable to collect data from every point in the entire country, and used Random Forest, a 'tree-based machine learning algorithm' to create their maps. Though the researchers originally began looking just at the country's national parks, their more recent research has included data from urban areas and airports. The noise study's combined map bears a striking resemblance to NASA's map of nighttime light, with much of the activity clustered around humans in big cities.","completion":"Scientists have found the quietest places in America by studying noise levels throughout the country.

Is the premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack.\\" true if \\"The backpack is filled with food.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" describes a scenario where there is an adult male carrying a young child with a backpack on their back. However, this statement by itself does not provide any information about the contents of the backpack, as it simply describes the physical scenario of a man, a child, and a backpack. Now, let's consider the additional piece of information you provided: \\"The backpack is filled with food.\\" This statement clarifies what is inside the backpack, and now we know that the contents of the backpack are food items. With this additional information, we can analyze and determine the accuracy of the entire premise. The premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" is still true, as it accurately describes the scenario. The presence of food in the backpack does not negate or contradict this statement in any way. In fact, the additional context from the second statement serves to provide more detail about the situation. However, if you'd like to create a more comprehensive and inclusive statement that reflects the additional information, you could say: \\"A man is holding a small child who is wearing a backpack filled with food.\\" This new statement provides a clearer and more complete picture of the situation at hand, ensuring the accurate representation of all the known variables. It captures not only the presence of the man, the child, and the backpack but also the contents of the backpack, which is food. In conclusion, the premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" is true regardless of whether or not the backpack contains food, and the presence of food does not change the validity of this statement. The fact that the backpack is filled with food adds an extra layer of detail to the scenario, painting a more vivid picture of the circumstance."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a frontier town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy. With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workersâwho have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the communityâto build a fake town as a diversion.

The start was at McCovey Cove, where Norman Bellingham of the U.S. Olympic Committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Chinese 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Lin Li. The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \\"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \\"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \\"everyone's best interest\\" and that he believed people had been \\"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \\"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC.

She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri MoorÃ©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond.

But Julia was suspected to be not only cheating on Clyde, but also stealing from him, for gangster boyfriend Joe Morelli.And the Wynant family was as happy as Nick last left them.

A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned. Older members of the organization who are no longer involved in decision-making tell Frank that it was Dom...

He gave us some nonsense about how our back and feet have to be properly alined to promote good circulation.... I don't know what the hell he was talking about and he honestly would not STOP talking. What really stood out to me was the lack of la-z-boys! Where were all the reclining chairs they're famous for?? And the lack of leather furniture too. They used a lot of a cheap-looking imitation. I pictured them as being a bit more upscale, but instead I felt more like I was in one of those warehouse places. Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is negative. The first indication of the negative tone is the user's initial statement that they found the people inside Ashley's Furniture \\"annoying\\". This suggests dissatisfaction with the in-store customer service. The use of strong, negative words like \\"unbearably aggressive\\" when describing the salesperson further emphasizes this dissatisfaction. Secondly, the user disagreed with the salesperson's lines about alignment and circulation, referring to it as \\"nonsense.\\" This not only suggests the user perceived their advice as unhelpful or untrue, but also found the continuous talking bothersome. Lastly, the user complains about the quality and variety of the furniture, specifically mentioning the lack of la-z-boys (reclining chairs) and leather furniture. They described the furniture as cheap-looking imitation, and compared the store ambiance to a warehouse, both being negative descriptors. Thus, considering all these factors, it is clear that the user's review is negative due to expressed dissatisfaction with the customer service, furniture quality, and the overall shopping experience."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: When animals get rid of their gaseous waste, what is exhaled through their mouth and nose? Choices: - oxygen - carbon monoxide - hydrogen - carbon dioxide A: The answer is:","completion":"carbon dioxide When animals, including humans, consume food, their bodies break it down through a process called cellular respiration. During this process, the energy stored in the food is converted into a form of energy that the body can use, called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. The process of cellular respiration involves a series of chemical reactions, which ultimately produces carbon dioxide and water as waste products. This process also requires oxygen as a reactant, which is why animals need to breathe in oxygen from their environment. As the cellular respiration process generates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, it begins to accumulate in the animal's bloodstream. In response, the animal's respiratory system works to expel this excess carbon dioxide out of the body to maintain its internal homeostasis. This gaseous waste, or carbon dioxide, is exhaled through an animal's mouth and nose. The options given were oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The answer is carbon dioxide because it is the gaseous waste generated through the process of cellular respiration and expelled through an animal's mouth and nose. Oxygen is necessary for the cellular respiration process, but it is not a waste product. Carbon monoxide is not produced in significant amounts during cellular respiration and is a toxic gas to humans and animals alike. Hydrogen, although involved in some of the chemical reactions in cellular respiration, is not the primary gaseous waste product exhaled by animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Charles \\"Wag\\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told Roger C.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eggs are used in the batter happens, how will it affect the cake will not rise. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. In the context of baking, a perturbation refers to a change, disturbance, or modification in the standard recipe or procedure. The perturbation hypothesis mentioned in the question assumes that eggs are used in the batter. However, it also states that the cake will not rise, which suggests that something is amiss with the expected chemical reactions within the cake. Direct effect: The use of eggs plays an essential role in the process of baking a cake, as eggs contribute to the structure, leavening, and texture of the cake. The proteins in eggs help in creating a stable structure, while the fats contribute to a moister and tender crumb. More specifically, eggs help the cake to rise by incorporating air into the batter during mixing. The proteins then coagulate during baking, providing the necessary structure for the cake. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that the inclusion of eggs will not result in the cake rising as expected. This indicates that there may be a problem with either the eggs themselves, the other ingredients, or the method being followed. Indirect effect: As observed, the failure of the cake to rise due to the supposed perturbation affects the various stages of the process. The different steps involved in the process, such as mixing the ingredients, baking, cooling, and serving the cake, would be impacted by the cake's failure to rise and achieve the proper texture and structure. The unsuccessful leavening process might be attributed to several factors, such as expired or chemically imbalanced baking powder or baking soda, inadequate amounts of eggs or other leavening agents in the recipe, insufficient mixing, or a disruption in the heating process during baking. In this scenario, the perturbation hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the overall cake-making process, as it results in an undesired outcome—the lack of rise in the cake—that would influence not only the texture and structure of the cake but also the steps that follow with cooling and serving a well-baked cake. Consequently, it may be necessary to reevaluate the recipe or technique being used to prepare the batter, ensure the use of fresh and appropriate ingredients, and maintain proper baking procedures to achieve a well-risen cake."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Help as much as you can. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

DUSSELDORF - Struggling German retail concern KarstadtQuelle asked shareholders Monday for a EUR 500 million capitalisation increase, at the same time cautioning that it may only just barely turn a profit again in 2005. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is essentially about the financial condition and strategic plans of the German retail company KarstadtQuelle. It explains how the company, which is currently facing financial difficulties, is trying to enhance its capital and significantly augment its financial health through a proposal to its shareholders for an increase in capitalization by EUR 500 Million. Capitalization, in business, can refer to the sum of a company's long-term debt, short-term debt, common equity, and preferred equity. Therefore, a request to increase capitalization is an appeal for more investment from shareholders, which can be used for various purposes such as running the company's operations, paying off debts, investing in new projects or strengthening the company's overall financial position. Alongside this important proposal, KarstadtQuelle is also expressing a cautious outlook for the future. The firm anticipates just barely returning to profitability in 2005. An assertion that suggests the company is in a recovery phase and that it may take a while for the effects of the capital injected - if the shareholders do agree with the increase - to manifest in significant profit. The move by KarstadtQuelle to increase its capitalization thus signifies a key step in its business strategy to overcome current struggles and improve its financial standing. At the same time, the cautionary note about likely limited profitability in the following year highlights the continuing challenges and uncertainties the company faces in its bid to achieve financial stability and growth. It reflects that the company is in a critical phase of reshaping its financial structure, where its operational performance, strategic plans, shareholders' confidence, market conditions, and other financial and non-financial aspects will possibly determine its future success or failure."},{"prompt":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The following five destination shall never be missed *Blue Lagoon : Blue Lagoon geothermal spa is one of the most visited attractions in Iceland.

The mixed reviews are not only reflected on various online platforms, but it's also a common topic among the community, causing a palpable level of disappointment for what was once a beloved joint. Customers highlight a need for significant improvements, noting that the meals are predominantly greasy, processed, and often served lukewarm, reflecting a seemingly clear disregard for the intricacies connected with the art of cooking, thus contributing to its low standing in the fiercely competitive world of food and hospitality. In addition, some argue that The Phoenix is not living up to its name; instead of rising from the ashes, improving, and revitalizing its menu, it stubbornly clings to outdated fast food practices that fail to meet the increasingly health-conscious and quality-aware demands of today's customers. Despite the owner's attempts to justify it as a nostalgic ode to classic fast food, public sentiment seems to converge on the idea that time has overtaken The Phoenix, leaving it a relic of a bygone era, much in need of a gastronomic and customer service overhaul to reclaim its glory days, rescue its dwindling customer rating and start to show signs of the legendary phoenix's rebirth in its service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Untouchables Movie plot: During Prohibition in 1930, Al Capone has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station. Ness confronts Capone and his men over the deaths, but Malone intervenes to save him from being killed and urges him to persuade the district attorney not to dismiss...

Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax. When he'd stepped out the door twenty-two hours earlier he'd still had his job and was looking forward to a showing the rest of the art team his new designs for some of the higher-level monsters he wanted to add to the game.

It has continents and ocean basins. Continents are large land areas. These are the areas that are mostly above sea level. Ocean basins extend from the edges of continents. They include the ocean floor and Earths deep ocean trenches. You will also notice the ocean floor is not flat. It too has many Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old. Ocean basins may only be millions of years old. Because the continents are so old, a lot has happened to them! As we view the land around us, we see landforms. Landforms are physical features on Earths surface. These features change over time, but how? There are actually two types of forces at work. Question: \\"What are continents?\\" Answer: \\"Large stretches of connected land\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, that answer is correct. Continents are large stretches of connected land on Earth's surface, often separated by vast bodies of water such as oceans. They house diverse ecosystems, climates, and peoples. There are seven continents on Earth: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America. Now, let's imagine what Earth would look like without the oceans. If we were to completely drain all of Earth's oceans, the results would be nothing short of astonishing. Instead of vast stretches of open water, we would now be looking at a complex and varied landscape of underwater terrain. The ocean floor, once hidden beneath miles of water, would be prominently on display. The massive underwater mountains and ridges that line the ocean floor, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, would be visible, giving us new peaks to explore similar to those found on dry land. In fact, if the tallest point on Earth, Mount Everest, were placed underwater at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, there would still be over a mile of open space between the summit and the surface of the ocean. We might notice newly exposed underwater valleys, plains, and canyons that dwarf their dry counterparts. With the water gone, the abyssal plains would stretch out as vast, flat desert regions covering the planet's now-exposed ocean floor. Draining Earth's oceans would also reveal leftover remnants of human civilization. Sunken ships, aircraft, and other underwater artifacts would suddenly become accessible to exploration and examination. In regards to marine life, the disappearance of the oceans would cause a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The millions of species that call the ocean home would suddenly find themselves without a suitable environment, leading to one of the largest mass extinction events in Earth's history. Furthermore, Earth's weather patterns would be severely impacted with the absence of the oceans, leading to much more extreme climate fluctuations and bringing about numerous unforeseen consequences for life on land. In summary, draining Earth's oceans would produce an entirely new world, filled with unexpected geological features and landscapes. It would alter the planet's climate and ecosystems dramatically, ultimately causing severe consequences for both marine and terrestrial life forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The league is owned by the 20 member clubs that participate in the competition each season. These clubs act as shareholders, and they collectively make decisions related to league operations, including the election of the chairman and chief executive, as well as other major decisions. Since the composition of the Premier League changes every season due to promotion and relegation, the list of current shareholders is subject to change. However, as of the 2021-2022 season, the 20 Premier League clubs acting as shareholders are: 1. Arsenal Football Club 2. Aston Villa Football Club 3. Brentford Football Club 4.

What is the answer for the question: What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build? from the following article ? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park.

Background: Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, (1 May 1769 - 14 September 1852), was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain, serving twice as Prime Minister. His defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 puts him in the first rank of Britain's military heroes. Wellesley was born in Dublin, into the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive Lords Lieutenant of Ireland. Context: Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family in Ireland as The Hon. Arthur Wesley, the third of five surviving sons (fourth otherwise) to Anne and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His mother was the eldest daughter of The 1st Viscount Dungannon. As such, he belonged to the Protestant Ascendancy. His biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence in saying that he was born on 1 May 1769, the day before he was baptised. His birthplace is uncertain. He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, now the Merrion Hotel. But his mother Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin. Other places have been put forward as the location of his birth, including Mornington House (the house next door on Upper Merrion), as his father had asserted; the Dublin packet boat; and the mansion in the family estate of Athy (consumed in the fires of 1916), as the Duke apparently put on his 1851 census return. He spent most of his childhood at his family's two homes, the first a large house in Dublin and the second Dangan Castle, 3 miles (5 km) north of Summerhill on the Trim Road (now the R158) in County Meath. In 1781, Arthur's father died and his eldest brother Richard inherited his father's earldom. He went to the diocesan school in Trim when at Dangan, Mr Whyte's Academy when in Dublin, and Brown's School in Chelsea when in London. He then enrolled at Eton College, where he studied from 1781 to 1784. His loneliness there caused him to hate it, and makes it highly unlikely that he actually said \\"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\\", a quotation which is often attributed to him. Moreover, Eton had no playing fields at the time. In 1785, a lack of success at Eton, combined with a shortage of family funds due to his father's death, forced the young Wellesley and his mother to move to Brussels. Until his early twenties, Arthur showed little sign of distinction and his mother grew increasingly concerned at his idleness, stating, \\"I don't know what I shall do with my awkward son Arthur.\\" A year later, Arthur enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in Angers, where he progressed significantly, becoming a good horseman and learning French, which later proved very useful. Upon returning to England in late 1786, he astonished his mother with his improvement. Question: Did he go to college.. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, attended college. He initially enrolled at Eton College, a prestigious independent boarding school in England, where he studied from 1781 to 1784. However, he did not experience much success at Eton and was not happy there, partly due to feelings of loneliness. In 1785, following his lack of success at Eton and financial difficulties in the family, Wellesley and his mother moved to Brussels. Later, in 1786, Arthur enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in Angers, France.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who was Harriet Hobson returning the watch for? is inside the article: Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Harriet Hobson was returning the watch for Johnny O'Clock. Johnny gave Harriet the expensive custom pocket watch, along with a rejection note, to return to Guido Marchettis' wife, Nelle. This is because Nelle had given the watch to Johnny, but he wanted to reject her romantic advances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

Problem: peter invests a sum of money and gets back an amount of 800 in 3 years . david invests an equal amount of money and gets an amount of 854 in 4 years . if both amounts were invested at the same rate ( simple interest ) what was the sum of money invested ? Options: a ) 653 , b ) 664 , c ) 698 , d ) 744 , e ) 700 Output:","completion":"First, let's identify the variables: P: principal (sum of money invested) R: rate (simple interest rate) T_peter: 3 years T_david: 4 years For Peter: Amount_peter = P + Simple_Interest_peter 800 = P + (P * R * T_peter) For David: Amount_david = P + Simple_Interest_david 854 = P + (P * R * T_david) Both amounts were invested at the same rate and the same initial amount. We can write the simple interest equation for Peter and David: 800 = P + (P * R * 3) 854 = P + (P * R * 4) Next, we need to find the value of P. First, we can isolate the (P * R) term in each equation: 800 - P = P * R * 3 854 - P = P * R * 4 Now we can divide the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4: (800 - P)/3 = P * R (854 - P)/4 = P * R Since both of these terms are equal to P * R, we can set them equal to each other: (800 - P)/3 = (854 - P)/4 Next, we need to solve the equation for the value of P. Cross-multiply: 4 * (800 - P) = 3 * (854 - P) 3200 - 4P = 2562 - 3P Add 4P to both sides: 3200 = 2562 + P Subtract 2562 from both sides: P = 638 Now we have found that the sum of money invested is 638, which is not in the given options. Therefore, we need to double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. Going back to the simple interest equations for Peter and David: 800 = P + (P * R * 3) 854 = P + (P * R * 4) Let's plug in the value of P that we found: 800 = 638 + (638 * R * 3) 854 = 638 + (638 * R * 4) Now, let's solve for R. For Peter: 162 = 638 * R * 3 162 = 1914 * R R = 162 / 1914 R = 0.084639 For David: 216 = 638 * R * 4 216 = 2552 * R R = 216 / 2552 R = 0.084639 Since we got the same rate for both Peter and David, our calculations for P seem to be correct.

Information: - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - Chitin (CHON) is a long-chain polymer of an \\"N\\"-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulae of molluscs, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses and on the scales and other soft tissues of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved versatile for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off a part of its body (often, but not always, an outer layer or covering), either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle. - Habelia is an enigmatic genus of extinct arthropod from the Middle Cambrian . Its fossils have been found in the Burgess Shale in British Columbia , Canada . 54 specimens of Habelia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed , where they comprise 0.1 % of the community . - A body plan (also written bodyplan), Bauplan (German plural Baupläne), or ground plan is \\"an assemblage of morphological features shared among many members of a phylum-level group\\". The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Idaho is a state in the northwestern region of the United States. It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. With a population of around 1.7 million people and an area of , Idaho is the 14th largest and 39th most populous of the 50 states. The state's capital and largest city is Boise. - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - An exoskeleton (from Greek , \\"éx\\" \\"outer\\" and , \\"skeletos\\" \\"skeleton\\") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as \\"shells\\". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

(CNN) -- Penn State's legal battles continued Wednesday with the university's primary general liability insurer filing a motion claiming coverage should be denied because the administration failed to disclose what it knew about former coach Jerry Sandusky's behavior, according to legal documents. The motion, filed in common pleas court by the Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association, says Penn State did not provide it with information relevant to the insurable risk the association assumed.

The ongoing legal battle between Penn State and its insurer highlights the university's continued struggle to resolve the fallout from the Sandusky scandal.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on? Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

In contrast, the statement emphasizes that this is not about conducting real negotiations among equal partners.

By engaging in open dialogue and being receptive to the various concerns of each party, they can ensure that the integration of certain states into the union is handled in a manner that acknowledges and respects the interests of all involved. Ultimately, a genuine negotiation involving equal partners can pave the way for stronger collaboration, shared goals, and mutual understanding among the different states participating in the alliance. Such an outcome benefits not only the involved parties but also the union as a whole, bolstering its stability and ability to address future challenges."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Photo: AP An African-American dishwasher at Yale University has lost his job after breaking what he described as a “racist, very degrading” stained-glass window panel at one of the university’s dining halls, the New Haven Independent reports. The panel depicted two slaves picking cotton. Last month, Corey Menafee was working in Yale’s Calhoun residential college dining hall—named for former vice president John C. Calhoun, an advocate of slavery—when, on an impulse, he decided to reach up with a broomstick and knock the panel out of its frame. From the Independent: Menafee, who is 38 years old, said he wasn’t motivated by allegiance to student activists when, while helping clean the hall on Monday, June 13, he decided on a sudden impulse to knock the panel down. “I took a broomstick, and it was kind of high, and I climbed up and reached up and broke it,” he said. “It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to come to work and see things like that.” “I just said, ‘That thing’s coming down today. I’m tired of it,’” he added. “I put myself in a position to do it, and did it.” Students and faculty have called for Calhoun’s name to be changed; Yale President Peter Salovey announced in April that that would not be happening. Recently, Yale changed the title used by certain members of the school administration from “master” to “head of college.” Menafee lost his job, he told the Independent, because the university deemed him a threat to students; he’d been working at the school since September 2007. “I didn’t commit any acts of violence against anyone or any living thing,” he said. “I didn’t be belligerent, or yell. I just broke the windows.” Jonathan Holloway, dean of Yale’s undergraduate college, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gawker. UPDATE: After this post was published, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy sent Gawker this statement: ||||| by Daniela Brighenti, Qi Xu, & David Yaffe-Bellany | Jul 11, 2016 4:06 pm (1) Comment | Post a Comment | E-mail the Author Posted to: Higher Ed, Labor, True Vote (Note: We have temporarily suspended commenting and True Vote-ing on this story because our server couldn't handle the demand; we wanted to avoid having the site crash. We hope to renew those functions eventually.) An African-American dishwasher lost his job after losing his cool and breaking a stained-glass panel in Yale’s Calhoun residential college dining hall that depicted slaves carrying bales of cotton. The dishwasher, Corey Menafee, said he used a broomstick to knock the panel to the floor. He said he was tired of looking at the “racist, very degrading” image. Yale University Police arrested Menafee, who now faces a felony charge. The university, meanwhile, has cut ties with him. (It was not officially clear Monday afternoon how exactly that happened.) His actions provide the latest chapter in a contentious debate over the racially charged symbolism of the college, named for slavery advocate and former U.S. Vice-President John C. Calhoun. The debate gathered steam last summer with a petition demanding a name change, and has since grown to encompass the slavery-themed paintings, artifacts, and stained-glass tiles displayed in the college. In April, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that Yale will keep the Calhoun name despite a year-long campaign by students and faculty calling for it to be changed. Menafee, who is 38 years old, said he wasn’t motivated by allegiance to student activists when, while helping clean the hall on Monday, June 13, he decided on a sudden impulse to knock the panel down. “When I walked into this job, I wasn’t aware of none of that,” Menafee said. “And then you know, being there, you start hearing different things.” “I took a broomstick, and it was kind of high, and I climbed up and reached up and broke it,” he said. “It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to come to work and see things like that.” “I just said, ‘That thing’s coming down today. I’m tired of it,’” he added. “I put myself in a position to do it, and did it.” Yale Hospitality, Menafee’s employer, declined to comment on a personnel matter. Last week, “Head of College” (the new title replacing “master”) Julia Adams announced in an email to the Calhoun community that a set of stained glass panels depicting various moments from the statesman’s life would be removed from the college common room. In the email, Adams said the impetus for their removal came from a study conducted by Yale’s Committee on Art in Public Spaces “following damage to one of the windows” in the dining hall. In an interview, she declined to confirm that the window in question was the same panel broken by Menafee, referring further questions to University spokesman Tom Conroy. Conroy told the Independent that Menafee’s status is officially “not employed by the university.” He said he may not disclose any further information about what’s a personnel matter. Update: After this story was originally published, Yale Vice President for Communications Eileen O’Connor sent a statement to the Independent. “An incident occurred at Calhoun College, a residential college on the campus of Yale University, in which a stained glass window was broken by an employee of Yale, resulting in glass falling onto the street and onto a passerby, endangering [her] safety. The employee apologized for his actions and subsequently resigned from the University. The University will not advocate that the employee be prosecuted in connection with this incident and is not seeking restitution.” In an interview with the Independent, O’Connor said glass fell on the passerby but that the woman was not injured. O’Connor claimed that Menafee’s resignation was not a condition of Yale declining to pursue the charges. Menafee himself declined to comment on that same question. Last month, dining hall workers from across the university gathered in Calhoun to prepare food for a June 15 staff appreciation event on Old Campus, according to one of the workers involved. It didn’t take long for conversation to turn to the stained-glass panels on the Elm Street side of the building, said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the issue. “Everybody has something to say about them,” the worker said. “[Menafee] was the one who took action and busted that shit out.” Menafee, who has not been in touch with his colleagues since losing his job, said he smacked the stained glass twice with his broom, then watched the panel fall to the ground, where it broke into pieces. His boss, dining hall manager Samuel Feliciano, witnessed the episode, Menafee said, and police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. (Feliciano could not be reached for comment.) “I just went to the bathroom and shaved,” Menafee said, “to make sure I was clean-shaven for the authorities.” He was arrested in Calhoun and left the college in handcuffs. He faces a second-degree misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment and a first-degree felony charge of criminal mischief. He has yet to enter a plea. Menafee grew up in New Haven and has two children. He graduated from Virginia Union University in 2001 with a degree in mass communications. Before starting his job at Yale in September 2007, he worked for a management services firm, and also spent a few months as a substitute teacher. He said he regrets breaking the windows — ten seconds of action that cost him a job he loved. “It could be termed as civil disobedience,” Menafee said. “But there’s always better ways of doing things like that than just destroying things. It wasn’t my property, and I had no right to do it.” He lost his job, he said, because the university deemed him a potential threat to students, an assessment he vigorously contests. In an interview with the Independent, Conroy said Menafee’s status is officially “not employed by the university.” He said he may not disclose any information on personnel records. “I didn’t commit any acts of violence against anyone or any living thing,” Menafee said. “I didn’t be belligerent, or yell.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created. - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262).

Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum . - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion.

Around 1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\".

Title: A hefty little beast Review: I use this base for my drill press. The Mini Shop Fox is perfect for this application because the drill press has such a small footprint and the mobile base handles the extra weight well.My complaints, which aren't related to performance, include assembly and shipping.It took me about 20 minutes to assemble the product with 32 nuts and bolts. I had purchased two other Jet mobile bases for a table saw and band saw that had virtually no assembly at all. The Mini Shop Fox does handle more weight though.Also, shipping was an extra 9, even though Amazon advertised free shipping with tool purchases over a certain amount. This product came separately from the manufacturers warehouse, not Amazon's warehouse.Otherwise, I would have given this product a 5 star rating. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is overall positive. Step 1: Analyze the title The title \\"A hefty little beast\\" suggests that the product is substantial and useful, giving a positive impression. Step 2: Analyze the content The reviewer mentions that the product is perfect for their intended use and handles the extra weight well, which is a positive remark. Furthermore, they state that if not for the assembly and shipping issues, they would have given the product a 5-star rating. This indicates that they are generally satisfied with the product's performance. Step 3: Consider the negatives The reviewer brings up complaints about assembly and shipping; however, they clarify that these issues are not related to the product's performance. This means that the negative aspects do not outweigh the positive aspects of the product.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

She acknowledges this action as a \\"sensible signal\\" that highlights the compassion and understanding exhibited by the authorities in Afghanistan. The Christian convert, who was detained by Afghan officials in the past, faced numerous challenges and opposition due to switching their faith from Islam to Christianity. Despite the pressure, the individual remained steadfast in their beliefs and faced the consequences. This issue was closely monitored by international human rights groups, who were concerned about the condition and well-being of the Christian convert. Chancellor Merkel's statement has not only brought attention to the matter, but has also showcased the significance of religious freedom and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, regardless of societal norms and pressures. By referring to the release as a \\"sensible signal,\\" Merkel has applauded the decision of the Afghan authorities, who have displayed a sense of responsibility and flexibility towards their citizens and the international community. The release of the Christian convert in Afghanistan not only proves that individuals have the right to choose their religious path, but it also sends a message of tolerance and understanding to other nations around the world. In times of global conflict and increasing intolerance, such acts of kindness and consideration hold immense importance. It is hoped that this event serves as an inspiration to other nations to offer similar protection and understanding to their citizens, regardless of faith or beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into sound, then audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into what? Answer choices: - Light - chemical energy - matter - plasma - sound - energy - heat - fire A:","completion":"Audible ground fireworks primarily convert chemical energy into sound, as the question suggests. However, they also produce other forms of energy and byproducts in the process. Here's a breakdown of how audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into various forms: 1. Light - When the chemical reaction within fireworks takes place, it emits brightly colored light, which is one of the primary visual characteristics of any firework display. This happens when the energy from the reaction is absorbed by the electrons within the chemicals, which then get excited and release the energy in the form of light. 2. Chemical energy - The initial energy stored in the chemical compounds of firework is the chemical energy. Upon ignition, this chemical energy gets converted into other forms of energy, such as sound, light, and heat. 3. Matter - Although not a form of energy, matter is affected during the conversion process of an audible ground firework. The chemical compounds are transformed into other substances, such as ashes and smoke, as a result of the reaction. 4. Plasma - No plasma state is involved in the reaction of audible ground fireworks, so the conversion does not specifically result in plasma. 5. Sound - As indicated in the question, audible ground fireworks are designed to primarily convert chemical energy into sound. The reaction within the firework creates a rapid release of gases, which causes the surrounding air to expand and create a pressure wave we perceive as sound. 6. Energy - In general, energy can be considered a byproduct of the chemical reactions as it is transformed from one form (chemical energy) into others like sound, light, and heat. 7. Heat - When the firework combusts, it generates heat as a result of the exothermic reaction between the chemicals. This heat contributes to the loud noise, bright lights, and expansion of the gas in the firework. 8. Fire - While not an actual form of energy, fire represents a visible part of the exothermic chemical reaction taking place within the firework. The combustion of the chemical components generates the fire and heat we associate with fireworks. In summary, audible ground fireworks primarily convert chemical energy into sound, as mentioned in the question, but also produce other forms of energy and byproducts such as light, heat, and matter transformation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In interim boss Graham Barrow's first game in charge, Omar Bogle should have put the Latics in front when he fired wide after rounding Sam Johnstone. James Chester headed past Matt Gilks to give Villa the lead after the break. Scott Hogan then nodded in from Albert Adomah's cross, his first goal for Villa since joining from Brentford. Wigan, who dismissed manager Warren Joyce five days ago, should have taken the lead early on when Bogle hit the side netting from a tight angle. Both the former Grimsby striker and Gabriel Obertan then fired wide as the hosts had the better of the first half. Villa had gone close through Chester, who headed inches over just before the break, and it was the Welshman who broke the deadlock when he nodded home from close range with 17 minutes to go. Johnstone then denied Bogle with his fingertips before Adomah's cross found Hogan, who headed in from close range. Villa's form has dramatically improved in recent weeks but despite closing the gap on sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday from 17 to 11 points in their last two games, with just eight games to go a play-off spot for Steve Bruce's 12th-placed side remains unlikely.

Rollo kills Horace.","completion":"Title: A Twist in Fate Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot Outline: The small town of Serendipity has always been a quiet and peaceful place—a refuge from the chaos of the world. However, the sudden and mysterious death of the town's beloved and wealthy magnate, Horace Harrington, leaves everyone shocked and horrified—especially when it is discovered that it was a murderous act. As the investigation begins, several potential suspects emerge, each with a different motive. While the town gossips generate countless theories, our protagonist, Alex Westwood, a brilliant but introverted private investigator, is hired by Horace's family to solve the crime. As Alex delves deeper into the case, she unearths dark secrets about Horace's complicated past: a history of failed business ventures, bitter rivalries, and familial betrayals—all of which implicate multiple residents of Serendipity in his murder. Through unexpected friendships and interactions, Alex uncovers clues that eventually lead her to a surprising suspect: the town's lumbering and simple-minded yet gentle resident, Rollo Samuelson. Upon discovering this highly unlikely yet possible outcome, Alex confronts Rollo, who unexpectedly confesses to the crime. Just as Alex is about to turn him in, she becomes unsettled by a gut feeling that there is more to this story. Further investigation reveals that Rollo has been manipulated by another townsperson, who preyed on his kindhearted nature and vulnerability. This new suspect, Charles Mortimer, was a devious businessman who had dealings with Horace in the past, and had actually orchestrated Horace's death in order to gain control over his lucrative businesses. Charles had tricked Rollo into confessing to the crime to divert attention away from himself, taking advantage of Rollo's lack of understanding of the consequences. In the climax, Alex works with the local law enforcement to bring Charles to justice. Through courage and clever planning, they manage to expose Charles' fraudulent activities, ultimately proving Rollo's innocence. In the end, Charles receives the punishment he deserves, and Rollo is welcomed back gratefully into the community. Serendipity regains its peaceful atmosphere as the residents, united by the experience, learn the importance of trust, compassion, and truth. Meanwhile, Alex embarks on a new chapter in her life, leaving Serendipity with a sense of fulfillment from a case well solved and a newfound confidence in her abilities as a private investigator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.","completion":"In this scenario, Dee is more focused on studying leafcutter ants, while Bess learns everything she can about all other ants. Given the hint provided, most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex), however, have evolved a unique, specialized method of obtaining nutrition, as they exclusively feed on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. Despite their indirect herbivory behavior, leafcutter ants primarily rely on the fungus, rather than the leaves they collect, for their nutritional needs. The ants are mostly involved with providing the fungus with the ideal conditions and resources to grow. They recognize chemical signals from the fungus and adjust their plant collection according to the fungus's reaction. In turn, the ants feed on the gongylidia, which are structures produced by the fungi. Taking this into account, Dee would be reading and learning more about leafcutter ants, a specialized group of indirect herbivory ants, as they are her main interest. Bess, meanwhile, would devote her efforts to learning about various other ants, which can be assumed to entail less focus on leafcutter ants and their unique characteristics. So, in conclusion, Bess would be the person who reads less about indirect herbivory ants, specifically those involved in specialized symbiosis. While she might be knowledgeable about various types of ants and their different behaviors, her focus is less devoted to leafcutter ants and their unique symbiotic relationship with the fungi they cultivate, compared to Dee who dedicates her entire research to understanding leafcutter ants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An inquiry will now be made after a number of planning permission hurdles. CoW chiefs were forced to hand this term's British event to Donington Park. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Circuit of Wales Development Stalls Again, Inquiry Launched Amid Planning Permission Hurdles The Circuit of Wales (CoW), a highly-anticipated £315 million motorsport venue, has suffered another major setback as its development has been halted once more. Originally scheduled to resume construction in February 2020, it appears that the ambitious project is being held back by various planning permission issues. Consequently, a formal inquiry has been called to substantially address these problems and expedite the development process. Located near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, the Circuit of Wales was initially proposed in 2011 as a state-of-the-art multi-purpose venue that would host various motorsport events, concerts, and conferences. Envisioned as a catalyst for both local and national economic growth, the project has been met with optimism and support since its inception. However, it has faced one obstacle after another, significantly delaying its progress. These recent setbacks have forced the Circuit of Wales chiefs to hand over the hosting rights of this term's British motorsport event to the Donington Park racing circuit in Leicestershire, England. This move is a considerable blow to the CoW project and the surrounding community, as the event would have generated significant tourism revenue and created ample opportunities for local businesses. With numerous planning permission hurdles causing unwanted disruptions, the formal inquiry aims to scrutinize the outstanding issues and identify potential solutions. Among the key questions posed by the inquiry will be whether the development adheres to all necessary regulations and if it could have any detrimental environmental impact on the surrounding area. The inquiry will also scrutinize the involvement of government bodies and local authorities in the Circuit of Wales project. These entities play a critical role in granting permits and ensuring that the development adheres to all required standards. Cooperation between the project's stakeholders and seamless communication will be essential if the Circuit of Wales is to see the green light and move forward with its construction. Despite facing these challenges, the potential economic benefits of a completed Circuit of Wales remain unquestionable. The project could provide a significant boost to the local economy, creating thousands of jobs and attracting a wealth of business and tourism to the region. Furthermore, the CoW would put Wales on the map as a global motorsport destination, stirring up immense national pride. In conclusion, the Circuit of Wales is a highly significant project that has the potential to transform the motorsport landscape and the economy of South Wales. While the recent setbacks have halted its progress, the impending inquiry offers a vital opportunity to address the ongoing obstacles and find a feasible path forward. The community of Ebbw Vale and the country of Wales as a whole will be holding their breath in anticipation, hoping that the CoW can soon overcome these challenges and rev its engine to create a brighter future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record.

Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.

The 18-minute speech, televised nationally, described what happened in the April 20 explosion and fire on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig that led to what Obama called \\"the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.\\" He compared the millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean to an epidemic \\"we will be fighting for months and even years.\\" In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, OPTIONS: - America noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - BP noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Barack Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - CNN noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Gulf of Mexico noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Oval Office noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Republicans noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - U.S. noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Washington noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - White House noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\"","completion":"In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, President Barack Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" The President emphasized the importance of a swift and comprehensive response to the spill, outlining the actions taken by his administration to address the crisis. He mentioned the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard troops that have been authorized to assist in the containment and cleanup efforts. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other federal agencies have been closely monitoring the spill's impact on the Gulf's ecosystems and coordinating the response efforts. Obama also used his address to push for a new legislative agenda, focusing on the development and implementation of clean, renewable energy sources. He urged Congress to work together in passing comprehensive energy and climate legislation, stressing the need for a transition away from fossil fuels and a move towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly energy system. The President's call for action was met with support from environmental groups and clean energy advocates, who view the oil spill as a devastating reminder of the risks associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels. However, some critics argue that the President's speech did not offer sufficient details on how the administration plans to achieve these ambitious goals, particularly given the current political climate and the challenges in securing bipartisan support. In the meantime, the government and BP continue to collaborate on efforts to contain the leak and minimize its long-term impact on the Gulf region's economy and environment. New, innovative technologies are being explored to assist in the cleanup and recovery process, including the use of underwater robots and other advanced equipment. As the crisis in the Gulf unfolds, the nation's focus remains on both immediate containment and cleanup efforts, and on the broader issue of transitioning to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. The Gulf oil spill tragedy has brought the vulnerabilities of our current energy system into sharp focus, providing a powerful impetus for change. Ultimately, it will serve as a catalyst for the nation to seriously reassess its energy policies and to take bold action towards a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - toy - park - earball - play with - bounces I believe the correct choice is \\"toy\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"A super ball is a popular \\"toy\\" that children enjoy. The reason why the term \\"toy\\" perfectly describes a super ball is because it is an object designed for children's play and amusement. Super balls are typically made of a highly elastic polymer material that provides them with an incredible bounce, making them a fun and engaging plaything for kids. To fully understand why \\"toy\\" is the correct choice, let's discuss the other options and rule them out one by one: 1. Park: A park is a recreational area, usually outdoors, where people go to engage in various leisure activities such as playing on play equipment, having picnics, or engaging in sports. Although children might enjoy playing with a super ball at a park, the park itself is not specifically designed for the use of super balls. 2. Earball: An earball is not a relevant term in this context, and therefore, it does not relate to the question about a super ball. It's likely a made-up term that doesn't have any real meaning. 3. Play with: \\"Play with\\" is a verb phrase that describes the action of engaging with a toy or object for fun and enjoyment. While children certainly enjoy playing with super balls, the phrase itself does not accurately describe what a super ball is. 4. Bounces: This term describes the action or an attribute of a super ball, but it is not what a super ball is as a whole. Bouncing is one of the main features that make a super ball enjoyable for children, but it is merely an aspect of the toy, not the toy itself. In conclusion, a super ball is a popular \\"toy\\" that children enjoy due to its unique physical properties and capacity for incredible bounces. While the given alternatives might hint at some aspects of the super ball experience, none of them accurately define a super ball as the object it is. The term \\"toy\\" best encapsulates the essential nature of a super ball and its intended purpose - providing fun and entertainment for children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

As they stood there, going over each accomplishment, it was evident that Justin had been an outstanding athlete in his high school days - breaking records, leading his team to numerous victories, and earning numerous accolades for his outstanding performances. As they delved deeper into the details, they discovered that Justin had won multiple championships in various events such as 100 meters, 200 meters, 4x100 meter relay, and long jump. He had been a force to reckon with on the track, consistently displaying exceptional speed, agility, and determination, which had earned him the admiration of his coaches, teammates, and even his fiercest competitors. Joseph couldn't help but feel proud of his friend, knowing that those glory days were a testament to Justin's resilience and unwavering commitment to excel in everything he undertook. They spent hours reminiscing about past races, discussing the training routines, and analysing how different factors had contributed to Justin's successes. The records also provided a historical perspective, highlighting how sports have evolved over the years. They delved into the topic, comparing the training and coaching styles of their time to the present day, and how advancements in sports science and technology have shaped the landscape of athletics. Justin shared the challenges he had faced, the obstacles he had to overcome, and the countless sacrifices he had made to pursue his passion for the sport. Through these experiences, he had honed his character and mental toughness, which had contributed to his personal growth both in and out of the sports arena. These stories deeply resonated with Joseph, who also cherished the life lessons he had learned from his own participation in sports. As the day wore on, the two friends continued to peruse the records, reflecting on their own achievements, goals, and aspirations. The nostalgia triggered by revisiting the past opened up a new avenue of discussion, enabling them to explore the connections between their shared experiences and the individuals they have become. In the midst of these thoughtful conversations, one thing became abundantly clear to Joseph: the person standing before him was more than just a remarkable athlete; he was a person of immense strength, resilience, and determination. And so, as the sun began to set, casting vibrant hues across the sky, Joseph couldn't help but feel a deep sense of admiration for his friend.

Help as much as you can. Information: - The Sword of Osman was an important sword of state used during the enthronement ceremony of the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830 1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922. - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840 1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him. - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan. - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish : Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI . - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors. - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Mahmud-u sn\\", \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785 1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.

Information: - Subaru cars are known for the use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500 cc. Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine. - The International Geneva Motor Show is an annual auto show held in March in the Swiss city of Geneva.

Does \\"For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.\\" correctly answer the question of How can the ideal self be described in terms of the adolescent?","completion":"The statement \\"For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.\\" touches upon the role of the ideal self in adolescents, but it does not provide a thorough description of the ideal self within this context. To answer the question “How can the ideal self be described in terms of the adolescent?”, a more detailed explanation of the concept of the ideal self, its development, and its impact on adolescent behavior is required. The ideal self can be understood as an individual's mental representation of the traits, characteristics, values, and goals they aspire to possess. It serves as a guiding model that individuals strive to become, illustrating the best version of themselves that they can envision. In terms of the adolescent, this ideal self is often shaped by various influences, including personal desires, family expectations, cultural norms, societal pressures, peer groups, and media exposure. During adolescence, the concept of self becomes more complex and multifaceted. Adolescents begin to form self-concepts based on various domains of life, such as their academic performance, social relationships, physical appearance, and personal values. As they engage in self-discovery, adolescents are likely to encounter discrepancies between their current self and their ideal self. This awareness of the gap between the real and ideal self can evoke a range of emotional responses, including frustration, disappointment, and motivation. The statement highlights the distinction between the ideal self and the feared possible selves – the latter referring to the negative scenarios that individuals want to avoid, such as failure academically, socially, or in their future careers. These feared outcomes can provide additional motivation for adolescents to put in effort and work towards their ideal self. It is important to note that individual experiences with ideal and feared selves vary significantly, as everyone has unique self-perceptions and aspirations. In terms of adolescent development, the ideal self plays a critical role in shaping their identity and driving their behavior. When adolescents have a clear and constructive vision of their ideal self, it can serve as a source of inspiration, motivation, and direction for their lives, fostering self-improvement, learning, and personal growth. For example, an adolescent who aspires to become a successful scientist might be motivated to immerse themselves in their studies, participate in research projects, and seek out mentorship from professionals in the field. However, it is essential to recognize that the creation of an ideal self also carries potential psychological risks for adolescents. For some, the discrepancy between their current self and their ideal self might be too vast or unattainable, leading to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, external factors like unrealistic media portrayals or societal pressures may contribute to developing an ideal self that does not accurately represent an individual's values or desires. In these cases, it is vital for adolescents to develop healthy self-awareness, establish realistic goals, and seek guidance from supportive adults and peers in refining their understanding of the ideal self. In conclusion, the ideal self in terms of the adolescent can be described as a dynamic and multifaceted concept that serves as a guiding vision for personal growth and achievement. While it may provide motivation and inspiration for adolescents, it can also evoke feelings of discomfort and tension due to the discrepancies between the real and ideal self. The ideal self plays a critical role in adolescent identity development and behavior, and understanding its complexities can help support adolescents in navigating their unique journeys towards self-discovery and self-improvement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their quest to find the meaning behind the motel's name indicates a curiosity about local history and perhaps a personal connection or interest in the story behind the establishment. They spend a considerable amount of time, around half an hour, making their best efforts to find relevant information, which shows their dedication to the task. The historical society is a natural choice for this search, as such organizations often serve as repositories for local history, archives, records, and anecdotes. They usually have staff or volunteers who are knowledgeable about the area's past and can assist with research or provide valuable insight into any historical questions or curiosities. The passage also describes the characters' interaction with the woman behind the desk at the historical society, who shares her belief that Mormons are plotting to take over the world. This inclusion serves to add color to the story and provide a snapshot of quirky local beliefs, which might be an element of interest for the characters themselves. After their unsuccessful search at the historical society, the characters continue their day by finding a Mexican restaurant and enjoying a meal. This demonstrates that while they were focused on their original goal of uncovering the story behind the Blue Mist motel, they are also spending time together and experiencing the local culture.

Choices: - backyard - ribs - restaurant - louisiana - texas The rationale to choose \\"louisiana\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Louisiana is generally known for its good BBQ, although Texas is often considered the king of BBQ. However, the rationale to choose \\"Louisiana\\" as the answer can be based on several factors: 1. Unique Flavor Profile: Louisiana BBQ has a unique flavor profile compared to other BBQ styles. While Texas BBQ is known for its big, bold flavors with little to no sauce, Louisiana BBQ is typically characterized by its complex and slightly spicy sauces with a hint of sweetness. This is because Louisiana has a rich culinary history influenced by French, Spanish, African, and Native American cuisines, which results in a unique BBQ experience. 2. Specialties and Techniques: Louisiana is famous for its low-and-slow cooking method when it comes to BBQ. The state is known for its delicious BBQ pork ribs, which are slow-cooked for hours until they are tender and falling off the bone. Another specialty is their \\"barbecued\\" shrimp, which is actually not barbecued but rather sautéed with spices and served with crusty French bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. 3. BBQ Festivals: Louisiana is home to many yearly, popular BBQ events such as Hogs for the Cause and the Crescent City Blues and BBQ Festival. These events showcase some of the best Louisiana BBQ dishes, where BBQ lovers from across the state and beyond gather to celebrate the local barbecue scene. 4. Gumbo Influence: The Louisiana BBQ scene is also influenced by its famous gumbo culture. Gumbo is a soup-like dish from the region, and its flavors play a significant role in shaping the taste of Louisiana-style BBQ sauces. Gumbo's unique blend of spices, such as cayenne and paprika, bring a different depth of flavor to Louisiana BBQ, which sets it apart from other BBQ styles. 5. Fusion of Tradition and Innovation: Louisiana BBQ is a fusion of traditional barbecue techniques and modern cooking methods. The state's rich culinary history combined with the creative approach of talented local chefs has led to an innovative BBQ scene with unique dishes that you won't find in other areas. Overall, Louisiana's unique cultural influences, diverse range of flavors, and dedication to quality barbecue make it a worthy contender for the title of the delta state known for good BBQ. While Texas may have more widespread recognition when it comes to BBQ, Louisiana's distinct flavors and approach to barbecuing have helped create a delicious and memorable BBQ experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - History. Hokkaido () was settled by the Ainu, Nivkh, and Orok before recorded history. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history.

Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie. Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her - i.e. a shy Shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation. Also Amrita's naive nature, limited eye-contact, shy characteristics and answering softly to Shahid's questions. * The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece. Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the whole movie, and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly. Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya film. In fact Shahid and Amrita make a cute on-screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). On the whole, VIVAH delivers what it promised, a well made and realistic story of two families. The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's a must see!

Plot title: Holiday Inn Movie plot: Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby), Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire), and Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale) have a musical act popular in the New York City nightlife scene. On Christmas Eve, Jim prepares to give his last performance as part of the act before marrying Lila and retiring with her to a farm in Connecticut. At the last minute, Lila decides she is not ready to stop performing, and that she has fallen in love with Ted. She tells Jim that she will stay on as Ted's dancing partner. While heartbroken, Jim follows through with his plan and bids the act goodbye. One year later on Christmas Eve, Jim is back in New York City.

Later at the airport flower shop, while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted, Danny is accosted by employee Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who recognizes him as a talent agent and begs him for a start in show business. Danny refers her to Holiday Inn and gives her a pass to Ted's club. That night, Linda sits at the performer's table with Jim, who pretends he owns a big club and isn't sure he could use an act like Hanover and Dixon. Linda pretends she's a celebrity and friend of Ted's, then escapes when the two performers come to Jim's table.

While this procedure is expensive, this is because it is a surgery that should be done by a board certified plastic surgeon. Unless you can demonstrate to your insurance company that you need a neck lift for a medical reason, it likely will not be covered. A neck lift is not a minor surgery. You will be sedated, and the surgery will generally last two to three hours. Excess skin will be removed around the jaw area, and the surgeon may also alter the muscles to give you the appearance you want. If you have medical issues such as diabetes, alcoholism, heart disease, high blood pressure, or depression, you may not be a good candidate for cosmetic surgery. Additionally, smokers are sometimes not good candidates for cosmetic surgery. As this is a major surgery, you will need to undergo a thorough medical examination. You may have to stop taking certain medications, and if you smoke, you will need to quit. Your doctor will advise you on the risks to be aware of, as well as how to take care of yourself during recovery time. Before the surgery, you should avoid taking aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs because they can cause excess bleeding. Be sure to arrange transportation home from the surgery. As you will undergo general anesthesia, it will not be a good idea to try and drive yourself. As this is an invasive surgery, you will need time to recover. You will likely be asked to refrain from exercising for at least three weeks. During recovery, you may experience discomfort around your jaw. For example, you might experience swelling and bruising, a pulling sensation, tingling, or even burning. As with all surgeries, infection is a risk. As you are recovering, keep an eye on your temperature. If you develop a fever, contact your doctor right away.

Ten years later, Max's brother volcanologist Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is visited by Max's son, Trevor's 13-year-old nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson). In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book. In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on SnÃ¦fell, a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to Iceland to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist SigurbjÃ¶rn Ãsgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ãsgeirsson (Anita Briem) since her father had died some years earlier.[3] It turns out that SigurbjÃ¶rn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction. Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, having them trapped in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio then rides on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch-off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor get saved from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent, the floor of the vent breaks, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The volcanic vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth.

'Walter Mitty': David Stanton, 67, admitted stealing nearly £250,000 from his mother-in-law. A conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail deaf and blind mother-in-law to fund a luxury lifestyle, was today jailed for three years. David Stanton, 68, used money that should have been paying for Fanny Epps' nursing home bills to prop up his struggling business and buy top-of-the range cars and expensive holidays. Mrs Epps, the mother of Stanton's wife Ruth, died in March 2010 at the age of 94. Stanton, of Budleigh Salterton, Devon, admitting stealing £245,209.25p from Mrs Epps between November 2002 and February 2004. The conman,. who has oxygen tubes to help him breathe, also admitted converting. criminal property by funding the purchase of a £45,000 BMW 7 series car. Stanton got his hands on Mrs Epps money after she had a fall at home and it was decided she needed to move into a care home. He was handed control of her affairs and sold her house. But instead of using the money to pay nursing home bills, he kept it for himself. Defence lawyer Lee Bremridge argued that Stanton had actually been paying for his mother-in-law's care and that the amount stolen was £127,600 and not £245,000. But prosecutor Sean Brunton said money was still owed to the nursing home and that there will be a Proceeds of Crime investigation. Stanton's wife of 29 years revealed she has been left. destitute by his life of lies and compared. her ex-husband to Walter Mitty - a fictional ineffective character with. a vivid fantasy life in James Thurber's short story The Secret Life of. Walter Mitty. She even accused him of deliberately losing weight to back up his false claim that he was dying of cancer. Mrs Stanton said: 'I am now 68 and living in a one. bedroom flat. I am now working 12 hour shifts in a nursing home as a. care assistant to pay my rent.' 'I found out that he wasn’t paying any bills, not even on my car insurance. And of course we still owe thousands in fees for my mother’s care. My mother ended up staying in a tiny little room in a nursing home funded by social services. She died aged 94 and I don’t know if she had any idea about all this. 'I took him to court for some closure for my mother. 'He even auctioned furniture from our home where he had a safe. I ended up with just a few personal effects from my first husband who had died a long time ago. 'He is a Walter Mitty. Who knows if he has any money left, who knows if there was another woman. 'When he said he had cancer he deliberately lost weight. But then he later admitted that was not true. He is the most amazing conman.' Deceived: Fanny Epps at her 90th birthday with her daughters Sandra Locke, centre, and wife of David Stanton, Ruth, right. 'My mother had had a fall when she. lived in London. We had to sell her house to pay for her care down in. Devon. David had the Power of Attorney to sell her house. 'He said he had invested it in the money markets and that would pay for her to stay in the nursing home.' 'That’s how it went on, we all. thought he had done what he said he had done. But when I left him I. discovered there was no money. It had all gone along with our business. 'We had six mobility shops around the Westcountry and he had used some of the money to do this. 'But he was just spending, spending,. spending. We were having a very good life, a high life of a round the. world trip to Australia, driving BMW cars and an MG sports car and. living in a beautiful house. He was spending money we did not have. 'He said on paper we were millionaires.' The plundered estate should have been. left to Mrs Epps two daughters - Ruth and Sandra - and. her son, record producer and engineer Stewart Epps, who has worked with. Elton John, Robbie Williams, Oasis, Led Zeppelin, Paul Weller, Bill. Wyman, George Harrison and Jimmy Page. Speaking after her husband was sentenced today, Mrs Stanton said: 'I feel as least some justice for my. mother. If I had had my way it would have gone to trial. I had a lot. more to say, I also wanted justice for my children. But I did not get. the opportunity because he pleaded guilty. 'He said he only has 12 months to. live but there is no medical evidence of that. He has played on that. lots of times in the past. 'He even took out a mortgage in the. name of my handicapped son. So hopefully they feel some justice has been. done for them as well as my mother.' Exeter Crown Court: Judge Barry Cotter QC told David Stanton he should have 'few illusions' about what will happen when he is sentenced. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The article discusses the case of David Stanton, a 68-year-old conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail, deaf, and blind mother-in-law, Fanny Epps, to fund his luxurious lifestyle.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, were born in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents amicably divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. When his father was hired as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals in 1994, he offered Rex his first job in the NFL as a defensive assistant, working with the team's linebackers and defensive linemen. After nine straight losing seasons prior to Buddy's arrival, the Cardinals produced an 8-8 record in Buddy's first year as head coach. However, in his second season, the team went 4-12 and subsequently, the entire staff was fired despite the positive performance of the defense. Ryan went on to coach at three different colleges following his tenure with the Cardinals, though by the time he joined Kansas State in 1999, he was hopeful of a return to the NFL. Ryan received a call from newly named head coach Brian Billick of the Baltimore Ravens, who wanted to interview him for the defensive line coaching position. Having visited a class Ryan was teaching earlier in his career, Billick had been so impressed by Ryan's passion for the game of football that he decided to hire Ryan if he ever attained a head coaching position. When offered the position, Ryan accepted. In his first year, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL and second in rushing yards allowed. By his second year, in 2000, the Ravens' defense set NFL records for fewest points allowed and fewest rushing yards allowed. The defense allowed a combined 23 points in four playoff games en route to a Super Bowl XXXV victory, Ryan's only Super Bowl ring, over the New York Giants. The defense consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2005 following the departure of Mike Nolan, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. In 2006, Ryan received Assistant Coach of the Year awards from Pro Football Weekly and the Pro Football Writers Association. Upon the conclusion of the Ravens' 5-11 performance in 2007, the entire staff was dismissed on New Year's Eve. Ryan was one of the candidates interviewed by the Ravens for their head coaching vacancy; however, the Ravens chose to name John Harbaugh as the team's new head coach. Ryan also interviewed with Miami and Atlanta about filling their head coaching vacancies, but the offers went to Tony Sparano and Mike Smith respectively. Ryan was disappointed by his failure to obtain a head coaching job, but he agreed to return to Baltimore under the direction of Harbaugh, who retained Ryan as defensive coordinator and promoted him to assistant head coach. In 2008, Ryan's final year with the team, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL. The Ravens lost by a score of 23-14 in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, during which the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL, concluded an hour later when he accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets. Did the new team successfully coach?","completion":"Yes, the new team led by Rex Ryan as the head coach was successful in coaching the New York Jets. In the quoted article, it states that during Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL. When Ryan accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets, his coaching skills were put to the test. Under Rex Ryan's leadership, the Jets experienced a resurgence in their defensive performance, and the team was successful in improving its overall performance. In his first season as head coach in 2009, Ryan led the Jets to a 9-7 regular-season record and an appearance in the AFC Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Indianapolis Colts. In the following season, the Jets improved their regular-season record to 11-5 and once again reached the AFC Championship game, this time losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Although the team did not manage to win a Super Bowl during Ryan's tenure as head coach, his impact on the Jets' defense and overall team performance was notable. His coaching abilities helped the New York Jets transition from a struggling franchise to a competitive team in the AFC."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

OPT: (A). negative; (B). positive;","completion":"Based on the sentence from the movie review, it appears that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The statement \\"does little here but point at things that explode into flame\\" seems to suggest that the movie primarily relied on spectacle and special effects to entertain the audience, such as explosions or other visually impressive scenes. The use of the phrase \\"does little here\\" implies that the movie lacked depth or substance, and may not have offered much in terms of storytelling, character development, or any other meaningful aspects that could have made it a more well-rounded and enjoyable film experience. Additionally, by choosing to highlight that the movie only focuses on things that explode into flame, the reviewer may be lamenting the absence of a more engaging plot or rich, emotionally resonant performances from the cast. This is further supported by the negative connotation of the word \\"but\\" in the sentence, which indicates that the reviewer expected more from the movie but was left unsatisfied by what they saw. In summary, based on the provided sentence from the movie review, it is clear that the reviewer's perspective on the film is negative (Option A).

Hill farm started installing windbreaks, while Valley farm didn't have the funds to do that so they postponed the project. But I can use this background: Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops. This increases yields through reduced drying of the crop and/or by preventing the crop from toppling in strong wind gusts. What is an answer for this question: Which farm reduced the wind velocity around crops? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation and background information, Hill farm is the one that reduced the wind velocity around crops. Hill farm took immediate action to address the problem of winds destroying their crops by installing windbreaks. Windbreaks are strategically planted or constructed barriers that have the primary purpose of reducing wind velocities and protecting vulnerable crops from damage and toppling. These measures can include planting rows of trees or shrubs, constructing fences, or other such structures designed to break the force of the wind. In contrast, Valley farm did not have the necessary funds to implement windbreaks and consequently postponed the project. This means that they have not yet reduced wind velocities around their crops and still have the potential to suffer from further damage and reduced yields. The installation of windbreaks by Hill farm showed a proactive approach to mitigating the risks associated with wind damage and is expected to result in increased crop yields through the reduced drying of the plants and protection from wind topple. In addition, windbreaks can contribute to creating a more favorable microclimate within the farm by reducing soil erosion, conserving soil moisture, and providing habitats for beneficial insects and wildlife. In conclusion, Hill farm reduced the wind velocity around their crops by implementing windbreaks, which will potentially lead to increased yields and provide additional benefits as well. Valley farm, on the other hand, has not yet taken any action to protect their crops from the damaging effects of strong winds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. But I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. What is an answer for this question: Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Answer:","completion":"The volcanoes on Sarahn are likely more active than on Timon. This is because Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving. This process typically involves the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity, as seen during the periods when ancient continents on Earth, such as Pannotia, broke apart. In contrast, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite a while, suggesting less volcanic activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. But paleontologists object that no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have recently identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. The earliest known ancestor of primates is Archicebus achilles from around 55 million years ago. This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.

Through gradual expansion, it grew from ruling a small county in that region to the attainment of the rank of king (of Sicily) in 1713. Through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, it led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946 and, briefly, the Kingdom of Spain in the 19th century. The Savoyard kings of Italy were Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II. The last monarch ruled for a few weeks before being deposed following the Constitutional Referendum of 1946, after which the Italian Republic was proclaimed. What is the relationship between 'beatrice of savoy' and 'italy'? The answer is:","completion":"Beatrice of Savoy was a member of the House of Savoy, a prominent royal family that played a significant role in the unification of Italy. The House of Savoy, through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946. Therefore, Beatrice of Savoy has an indirect relationship to Italy through her affiliation with the House of Savoy, which contributed to the formation and ruling of the Kingdom of Italy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He now finds himself rich and (within his company) powerful, and married to the boss' (Bill McCutcheon) sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers (Rene Russo). At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler (Jon Lovitz) and wife Ellen (Linda Hamilton) from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternate self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger (Courteney Cox), and as Larry's problems multiply, he finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life.

The words \\"tepid\\" and \\"tedious\\" both have negative connotations and suggest that the person who wrote this review did not enjoy the film. The word \\"tepid\\" is often used to describe something that is lukewarm, lacking enthusiasm, or insufficiently stimulating. In the context of a movie review, this term implies that the film failed to engage the reviewer emotionally or intellectually. A successful movie should typically elicit a range of feelings and thoughts, be it excitement, sadness, happiness, or curiosity. The use of the term \\"tepid\\" suggests that the movie did not achieve this level of involvement for the reviewer. On the other hand, \\"tedious\\" suggests that the movie was boring, monotonous, or repetitive. It indicates that the reviewer found the film difficult to sit through and stay engaged. A movie that is perceived as tedious usually suffers from a lack of variety or interest in its plot, characters, pacing, or overall structure. A great film should maintain a viewer's attention throughout its runtime, but the use of the term \\"tedious\\" implies that this movie was not successful in keeping the reviewer's attention and interest.

The Priest A:","completion":"Title: Shattered Pages Setting: A picturesque but mysterious small coastal town in England, where superstitions and folklores hold great influence over the locals. Main Characters: 1. Grace Thompson: A journalist and an aspiring writer in her late 20's who moves to the coastal town to work on her first novel. 2. Father Donovan: A well-respected and enigmatic local priest, who is hiding a dark secret. 3. Tom Bennett: A kind and introverted historian and librarian who befriends Grace and helps her uncover the truth about the book. 4. Sarah MacDonald: A native of the town, a woman in her late 40's who is the descendant of the witch's bloodline. Plot: Act 1: Grace Thompson, a reporter from London, moves to a small coastal town to start fresh and write her novel. She settles in a quaint old house she rented, which belonged to the late Margaret Black, the town's rumored witch from more than a century ago. In the attic, Grace finds an old, damaged book, believed to contain dark magic practiced by Margaret Black. Act 2: Grace, unable to help her curiosity, starts researching the book's magical contents. She enlists the help of her new friend, Tom Bennett, a local historian and librarian. As they dig deeper into the book, strange, unexplained incidents begin to occur around them. The town's weather becomes erratic, objects move on their own, and whispers from the shadows haunt Grace. In the midst of the chaos, Father Donovan appears at Grace's doorstep and warns her about the consequences of meddling with the book. He reveals that Margaret Black has cursed the book, binding it to her spirit, and that dabbling with the book would unleash an ancient evil. Act 3: Grace, initially skeptical, starts experiencing terrifying nightmares and unexplained cuts on her body. Fearing for her own sanity, she confides in Tom, who researches Margaret Black's story. From his findings, Grace learns about Sarah MacDonald, a local woman descending from witches' bloodline, and seeks her help to break the book's curse. As the town spirals into chaos, Grace, Tom, and Sarah, with the help of Father Donovan, work together to uncover the secrets hidden in the old house, unravel the mystery behind the damaged book, and cleanse the curse that continues to plague the town. Act 4: Grace and her allies discover that Margaret Black wasn't evil, but rather a victim of the priest who ruled the town and wanted power. They come to the chilling realization that Father Donovan, who has been guiding them all along, is a malevolent spirit, possessing the Priest's body and seeking the cursed book's power to sustain his control over the town. Act 5: In a dramatic climax, Grace, Sarah, and Tom confront Father Donovan, who reveals his malevolent intent. With the combined powers of their knowledge, bravery, and witchcraft, they banish the evil spirit from the priest's body and destroy the cursed book, saving the town from perpetual darkness. Epilogue: The town returns to its peaceful state, and the mystery of Margaret Black is finally laid to rest. Grace ultimately finds inspiration for her novel in the harrowing experiences she's had and even develops a romantic connection with Tom. The story concludes with Grace finally finding her place as an accomplished writer, embracing the extraordinary events that led her there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938?, what is it ?

Let's work together step by step! We have two terms with 'y' in them: -627*y and 151*y. To get all the y's on one side, we can add 627*y to both sides. It becomes: -627*y + 627*y = 151*y - 16338 + 627*y This simplifies to: 0 = 778*y - 16338 Now, we want to get 'y' alone. So, let's add 16,338 to both sides of the equation: 16338 = 778*y Almost done! To get 'y' all by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 778: 16338 / 778 = y This calculation gives us: 21 = y So, our final answer is y = 21. That means, when we multiply 21 with -627 and 151, both sides of the equation become equal. Great job solving the equation!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Hebrew is the only living Canaanite language left, and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language. Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Aramaic and to a lesser extent Greek were already in use as international languages, especially among elites and immigrants. It survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and poetry. Then, in the 19th century, it was revived as a spoken and literary language. It became the \\"lingua franca\\" of Palestine's Jews, and subsequently of the State of Israel.

When Dr V came to see me some weeks ago, he brought with him the bottle of strychnine that now sits empty upon my desk. He was in high spirits, because his latest alchemical experiment had been a success, and brought the strychnine in order to demonstrate the efficacy of his elixir. In truth, his very presence could be considered proof, since he had been dead earlier that morning, but, as I had not witnessed his revival, he wished me to see the results first hand. At his request, I summoned the chambermaid, while he prepared a syringe of strychnine. I thought he would ask her to procure a hen or some such thing for use in his demonstration however, when she arrived, Dr V-- plunged the syringe into her arm with no warning. I leapt from my chair, but before I could do more than cross the room, the strychnine took effect with results that horrified me.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: to pay their respects for the following movie plot: An onscreen text warns of the superstitious belief in a vorvolaka, a malevolent force in human form. The film proper begins during the Balkan Wars of 1912. While his troops are burying their dead, General Pherides (Karloff) and American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) visit the Isle of the Dead to pay their respects to the General's long-dead wife. They discover the crypt despoiled; hearing a woman singing on the supposedly uninhabited island, they set out to find her. They also find retired Swiss archeologist Dr. Aubrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), his Greek housekeeper Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig), British diplomat Mr. St. Aubyn (Alan Napier) and his pale and sickly wife (Katherine Emery), her youthful Greek companion Thea (Ellen Drew), and an English tinsmith. While Aubrecht apologizes for his part 15 years ago in inspiring local peasants to rob graves for valuable Greek artifacts, Kyra whispers to the General that a vorvolaka, in the guise of the red and rosy Thea, is in their midst. The General laughs at such superstition and accepts Aubrecht's invitation to spend the night as his guest. The next morning, the tinsmith is dead. Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch) is summoned; he determines the cause to be septicemic plague and quarantines the island. The Doctor explains how plague is passed and how it may be eradicated in one day if the hot, dry sirocco winds arrive. The archeologist says that Mme. Kyra's explanationÂ â that God sends the plague to punish them for harboring a vorvolakaÂ â makes just as much sense. When Mr. St. Aubyn dies, the General demands that his body be buried immediately, to the horror of the cataleptic Mrs. St. Aubyn, who fears premature burial. Next to die is Dr. Drossos, proving that the advice of modern science does not guarantee victory over the disease. Suspicion returns to Thea, and Kyra harasses her with taunts and threats. The General vows that he will kill Thea if evidence appears that she is vorvolaka. Fearing for Thea's life, Oliver plans to escape with her, but the general...

We’ll go to the higher court ” Khandker Mahbub Hossain the leader of Khaleda ’s legal team told reporters. Khaleda ’s son Tarique Rahman and four others were jailed for 10 years at the end of a case that lasted nearly 10 years. Khaleda and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) say the charges are part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.

[ii] it is not possible to tell. [iii] no.","completion":"[ii] it is not possible to tell. The two sentences, although they both address the topic of productivity, do not provide enough information to definitively determine if the second sentence is true solely based on the truth of the first sentence. The first sentence discusses productivity in a general and unspecified context. It assumes a 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity through the end of the simulation period, even if investment collapses. However, no specific area or department is mentioned, and it is unclear whether this statement refers to productivity as a whole, including all the departments within the organization, or in a specific context. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on a particular scenario: productivity in the mailroom. It expects a 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity, but does not provide any information about the external factors or circumstances that could affect this growth. The two sentences share similarities, such as the 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity; however, we cannot assume that the information in the first sentence automatically applies to the mailroom specifically, as mentioned in the second sentence. Additionally, the first sentence expresses the possibility of an investment collapse, while the second sentence does not mention any such scenario. This brings the possibility that the second sentence might be considering conditions without the influence of any investment collapse, making it harder to link the two sentences. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true based solely on the information provided in the first sentence. There is not enough context or information about how the assumed 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity in the first sentence applies specifically to the mailroom mentioned in the second sentence, or how external factors like investment collapse are considered in the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who campaigned to remove the inscription from the Monument to the Great Fire of London? is inside the article: Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\".

Therefore, I will explain how to set up a projector to display a film of phone calls. 1. Choose and set up the projector: First, select a projector that meets your requirements based on factors such as brightness, resolution, and connectivity. Set up the projector in a location where it will project a clear image onto a screen, wall, or any other flat surface without any obstructions. 2. Connect the projector to a playback device: Depending on the type of projector you have, there are different ways to connect it to a device that can play the film of phone calls. You may connect the projector to a computer, laptop, smartphone/tablet, or media player using HDMI, VGA, USB, or any other appropriate cable provided by the manufacturer. 3. Audio setup: If your film of phone calls includes audio, you will need an audio setup. Some projectors have built-in speakers, in which case you just need to ensure the volume is set to an appropriate level. However, if your projector does not have built-in speakers, you will need to connect it to an external audio system such as a soundbar, home theater system, or a simple set of computer speakers. 4. Content playback: Once connected, open the film of phone calls on your playback device. While playing the content, make sure that the projector settings, such as aspect ratio, resolution, and brightness, are optimized for the best viewing experience. 5. Adjust the focus and image size: Once the film is displayed on the screen or wall, adjust the projector's focus and zoom controls to ensure the picture is sharp and clear. You can make the image larger or smaller by moving the projector closer to or farther away from the projection surface. Keep in mind that the distance to the surface affects the image quality, so strive for a balance between size and image clarity. 6. Control the room lighting: The darker the room, the better the image quality projected by the projector. Turn off unnecessary lights and close curtains or blinds to minimize ambient light. If the room cannot be fully darkened, adjust the projector settings to increase brightness and contrast for better visibility. 7. Ensure a comfortable viewing setup: Arrange seating such that people can comfortably view the projected film of phone calls without straining their eyes or necks. Make sure there are no obstructions in the viewing area that might block the projection or be distracting. By following these steps, you can successfully set up a projector to display a film of phone calls, enabling you and your audience to enjoy the content in a visually appealing and comfortable manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar was born on 6 January 1928 in Girgaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, where his father held a clerical job and ran a small publishing business. The literary environment at home prompted young Vijay to take up writing. He wrote his first story at age six. He grew up watching western plays and felt inspired to write plays himself. Tendulkar began his career writing for newspapers. He had already written a play, Amcyavar Kon Prem Karnar (aamcyaavrr konn prem krnnaar Who will Love us?), and he wrote the play, Grhastha (The Householder), in his early 20s. The latter did not receive much recognition from the audience, and he vowed never to write again. Breaking the vow, in 1956 he wrote Srimant, which established him as a good writer. Srimant jolted the conservative audience of the times with its radical storyline, wherein an unmarried young woman decides to keep her unborn child while her rich father tries to \\"buy\\" her a husband in an attempt to save his social prestige. Tendulkar's early struggle for survival and living for some time in tenements (\\"cal/chawls\\") in Mumbai provided him first-hand experience about the life of urban lower middle class. He thus brought new authenticity to their depiction in Marathi theatre. Tendulkar's writings rapidly changed the storyline of modern Marathi theatre in the 1950s and the 60s, with experimental presentations by theatre groups like Rangayan. Actors in these theatre groups like Shriram Lagoo, Mohan Agashe, and Sulabha Deshpande brought new authenticity and power to Tendulkar's stories while introducing new sensibilities in Marathi theatre. Tendulkar wrote the play Gidhade (The Vultures) in 1961, but it was not produced until 1970. The play was set in a morally collapsed family structure and explored the theme of violence. In his following creations, Tendulkar explored violence in its various forms: domestic, sexual, communal, and political. Thus, Gidhade proved to be a turning point in Tendulkar's writings with regard to establishment of his own unique writing style. Based on a 1956 short story, Die Panne (\\"Traps\\") by Friedrich Durrenmatt, Tendulkar wrote the play, Santata! Court Calu Ahe (\\"Silence! The Court Is in Session\\"). It was presented on the stage for the first time in 1967 and proved as one of his finest works. Satyadev Dubey presented it in movie form in 1971 with Tendulkar's collaboration as the screenplay writer.

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what government type is north korea?\\" A:","completion":"A: The government type of North Korea is a \\"single-party totalitarian dictatorship\\" characterized by a centralized and highly authoritarian rule. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is governed by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) with Kim Jong-un serving as the Supreme Leader of the country. The political system is built upon the principles of Juche, an ideology emphasizing self-reliance, independence, and strong national defense, which was formulated by the country's founding leader, Kim Il-sung. In this single-party totalitarian dictatorship, the supreme leader wields absolute power over the government, military, and every aspect of society. The government tends to exercise strict control over the economy, media, and education, severely limiting the flow of information and freedom of expression. There is also an extensive security apparatus put in place to suppress any dissent or perceived threats to the regime. The North Korean political structure includes several institutions that support and reinforce the ultimate authority of the supreme leader. Some of these institutions are: 1. Workers' Party of Korea (WPK): The primary political institution, the WPK serves as the ruling party with the supreme leader as its head. All major decisions are made through the WPK, and it controls all other institutions in the country. 2. Supreme People's Assembly (SPA): The unicameral legislature of North Korea, the SPA consists of deputies elected every five years. However, the elections are largely a formality, as the candidates are pre-selected by the WPK, and there is often only one candidate for each position. 3. National Defense Commission (NDC): Overseeing the armed forces, the NDC is responsible for implementing defense policies and ensuring the military's loyalty to the regime. The supreme leader, who serves as the chairman, holds ultimate control over the commission. 4. Cabinet: Responsible for implementing policies and managing the country's economy and administration, the cabinet is composed of ministers and officials appointed by the supreme leader. Despite having a constitution that mentions democratic principles, in reality, the political system of North Korea lacks any actual democratic processes. The power is highly centralized, and the population is subjected to pervasive propaganda, indoctrination, and surveillance to maintain regime stability and control. In summary, North Korea's government type can be accurately described as a single-party totalitarian dictatorship, with the supreme leader exercising absolute authority over all aspects of the state and society through the domination of the Workers' Party of Korea and an elaborate system of control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 00:14 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 00:18 EST, 9 May 2013. A 63-year-old man who only leaves his Michigan apartment to make frequent trips to the doctor's office is now being summoned to a prison in Arkansas because he never served his full term for killing his father as a teenager. The case of Lester Stiggers is bringing a decades-old interstate turf battle back to the forefront as the Governor of Arkansas has called for Stiggers to be extradited back to Arkansas. Stiggers was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965. Back to his past: Lester Stiggers was arrested in 1965 for murder but has been out of prison since 1971 because of the former Governor of Michigan's ruling in his favor. When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived. He's been there ever since - thanks to the then-governor of Michigan who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its notorious prison system. Enforcing the law: After Stiggers was discovered recently, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe ordered him to be sent back to the state to serve his time. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have the elderly fugitive returned in spite of his poor health. ‘I'm an invalid now. I'm half dead. What would their interest be to have me back?’ Stiggers said. Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system, but that will not make him revoke his request. 'We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,' Beebe told the AP. 'And. once the Department of Correction was given information about his. whereabouts, and... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant,. then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.' The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan. He gets by on 700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor. His life now: Stiggers is 63-years-old, in poor health, and lives with his companion Delphine Hopkins in a small apartment in Warren, Michigan. He is seen holding Ms Hopkins' granddaughter in this photo. He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand. He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison - more than four decades after then-Governor William Milliken blocked the state's initial request. At the time, Milliken wrote that the notorious Arkansas prison system was a form of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. 'No purpose would be served now by sending that man back,' the former governor told the Associated Press. Now 91-years-old, Mr Milliken said that. he does not remember Stigger's case specifically but the move to allow. the young black man to stay in the midwestern state does seem fitting. Then and now: Former Michigan governor William Milliken, seen in 1978 at left and 2008 at right, initially allowed Stiggers to stay in his state because the Arkansas prison system was notorious at the time. 'Knowing how distressed I was about the shameful state of race relations in our country, I would have wanted to give that man another chance,' he said. Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar. State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either, but Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas. 'It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,' Wilson said. 'And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.' Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and 'there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. Lester Stiggers, a 63-year-old man, is being summoned to a prison in Arkansas as he never served his full term for killing his father as a teenager in 1965. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. 2. Stiggers was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior in 1971 and went to Michigan, where his mother lived. The then-governor of Michigan refused to send him back to Arkansas and its notorious prison system. 3. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe has recently called for Stiggers to be extradited back to Arkansas to serve his time, despite his poor health. 4. Beebe said he wasn't aware of Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system, but that will not make him revoke his request. 5.

This heroine also had to work for a living (she was a teacher), and had a very giving heart. She is shadowed by a horrific past and her youthful innocence was shattered by war atrocities. The hero is conflicted by his own past as well, and develops a sympathy for this not-so-beautiful- on-the-outside young woman.

His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years. The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke. The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz. Answer this question \\"Can you tell me more about what happened after the death of their father?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"After the death of their father, Chester Hogan, the family faced financial difficulties, and all the children started working to help support their seamstress mother.

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts.

But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. and the situation: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning. The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous. Answer the following question: Which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure? A:","completion":"Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure during the hurricane event compared to Dune city. To understand the reasons behind this, it's essential to look at some factors and concepts related to hurricanes. A hurricane is a large and intense storm system characterized by a cyclonic circulation, and it has a low-pressure center called the \\"eye.\\" The eye of the hurricane is surrounded by the eye wall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur. The barometric pressure at the eye is the lowest compared to the rest of the storm. When a hurricane makes landfall, as it did in Dune city, the eye of the storm passes directly over the affected area, causing the atmospheric pressure to be at its lowest within the city limits. This low pressure is associated with storm surges, heavy rainfall, and damaging high winds. On the other hand, Shore city was 50 miles away from the direct impact of the hurricane. Therefore, it did not experience the lowest pressure associated with the eye of the storm. As the distance from the eye increases, the atmospheric pressure gradually rises. Consequently, Shore city had a higher atmospheric pressure than Dune city during the hurricane event. It is crucial to note that even though Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure than Dune city, it may still have been subjected to some adverse weather conditions like gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding caused by the distant hurricane. However, the extent of these effects would have been significantly less severe than the conditions experienced in Dune city."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

How long does meth say in your urine? How long does it take for meth to not show in a UA if smoked? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(2). yes These two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the duration it takes for methamphetamine (meth) to become undetectable in a urine analysis (UA) after smoking. Each question is essentially asking the same information but with slightly different phrasing. Methamphetamine, also known as meth, crystal, or ice, is a potent and highly addictive central nervous system stimulant. It can cause a wide range of physical and psychological effects, and is abused for its euphoric and stimulating properties. When someone uses meth, it is metabolized in their body and eventually eliminated through urine. Therefore, urine drug tests or urine analysis (UA) are commonly used to detect the presence of meth in a person's system. The detection time of meth in your urine primarily depends on several factors, including the dosage, individual metabolism, frequency of use, body mass, and overall health. The average time frame for meth to remain in the urine is between 3 to 5 days after last use for occasional users, while habitual users may test positive for up to 7 to 10 days or even longer. However, these numbers are not set in stone, as individual factors can significantly influence detection times. In general, when a person uses meth, the drug starts to metabolize in their system and gets eliminated through their urine as they detoxify. The kidneys filter out toxins from the blood, and some of these toxins, like drug metabolites, get excreted in the urine. Meth has a half-life of around 12 hours for most people, meaning it takes approximately 12 hours for the concentration of the drug to be reduced by half. However, individual metabolic rates can significantly impact the speed at which this process occurs. Urine tests for meth target a major meth metabolite called amphetamine, which may be present in the body even after the effects of meth have worn off. Urine tests can typically detect this metabolite within a couple of hours after use, up to several days, or even weeks for long-term, heavy users. Factors that may affect detection times include: 1. Dosage: Higher doses of meth will generally result in a longer detection time because a larger amount of the drug is present in the body. 2. Frequency of use: Frequent users often have higher concentrations of the drug accumulated within their system, increasing the detection time. 3. Individual metabolism: Some people's bodies process and eliminate drugs faster than others due to differences in genetics and metabolism. 4. Body mass: Individuals with higher body fat content may retain meth in their bodies longer than those with lower body fat levels. 5. Overall health: A person's overall health, including kidney and liver function, can affect how quickly meth is metabolized and eliminated from the body. In conclusion, the duration of meth detectability in urine varies from one person to another, depending on several factors. If you believe you or someone you know may be struggling with a methamphetamine addiction, it is essential to seek professional help from a healthcare provider or a rehabilitation center to assess the situation and provide adequate support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you have later stage cancer or if surgery is not your preference and you have stage I cancer, talk to your doctor about radiation therapy. Radiation therapy requires multiple visits, but the advantage is that it is not invasive like surgery (i.e. it does not require cutting into you to remove the cancer). There are two types of radiation that are commonly used to treat cervical cancer. The first is called external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), in which the radioactive beams are emitted from a source outside your body and directed toward your cervix and the surrounding area. The second type of radiation therapy is called brachytherapy — rods containing radiation are inserted through the vagina up against the cervix. They are then left there for one to two days and emit local radiation which works to treat the cervical cancer. This is done in the hospital. Again, the extent of radiation as well as the effectiveness of this mode of treatment depends upon the stage and severity of your cervical cancer. Radiation treatment can have significant side effects. EBRT may cause fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea, skin damage, bladder discomfort, vaginal pain, anemia, and menstrual changes (including early menopause). Brachytherapy may cause irritation of the vagina and vulva. Fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, irritation of the bladder, and low blood counts may also occur. Long-term effects of radiation treatment may include vaginal scarring, which may make vaginal sex painful. You may also experience vaginal dryness, swelling of the legs, and it may weaken your bones. Radiation is most commonly combined with chemotherapy. This is because, for cervical cancer, the combination of radiation and chemotherapy is synergistic and provides significant additional benefit (rather than simply opting for one or the other). When chemotherapy is combined with radiation, as described above, it is termed \\"chemoradiation.\\" This can be a very effective mode of treatment, because the chemotherapy has what is called a \\"sensitizing effect\\" on the tissues on and around the cervix. What this means is that the tissues then become more susceptible to the radiation, and it is as such that the combined modality of treatment gains its synergistic effect. Unfortunately, many of the most effective methods for treating cervical cancer can have deleterious effects on one's future ability to have children. As a result, your doctor may recommend that you freeze some of your eggs prior to undergoing treatment such as radiation, so that the eggs do not become damaged due to the treatment. Most women will need to have a surrogate carry the pregnancy if they freeze their eggs. Summary:","completion":"Radiation therapy is a way to treat cancer without surgery. It uses special beams or rods that give off energy to kill the bad cells. You may feel tired, have an upset tummy, or have some pain from this treatment, but it can help get rid of the cancer. Sometimes, doctors use radiation therapy with other medicines to make it work even better. But, this treatment might make it harder to have a baby later, so talk to your doctor about saving some of your eggs before the treatment starts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As Alec leaves, Lindenbrook turns his attention back to the unusual rock.Alec arrives at Lindenbrook's house that evening to find that the professor never came home, and his niece, Jenny (Diane Baker), is both angry and worried.

Make this proper case.","completion":"Long considered to be extinct, the discovery of the tassel tail in 1938 stunned the scientific community. Scientists managed to catch a live specimen of this extraordinary creature and subsequently named it Latimeria, in honor of its discoverer, Mrs. Latimer. This event demonstrated the incompleteness of human knowledge about the natural world and its inhabitants. The story of the Latimeria's discovery is fascinating, as it initially began with a group of fishermen who happened upon a strange-looking fish. Lacking the appropriate scientific expertise, they were nevertheless able to recognize it as something unusual and decided to bring it to the attention of local experts. It was due to their keen instincts and willingness to share their findings that Mrs. Latimer, a prominent ichthyologist at the time, had the opportunity to examine the fish up close. Upon further study, Mrs. Latimer concluded that this mysterious creature was indeed a living member of a species long believed to have vanished from Earth. Its unique morphology and physiology resembled ancient life forms which had once thrived during the Devonian period. Consequently, it was assigned to the class Sarcopterygii, which includes lobe-finned fishes and their evolutionary descendants such as the tetrapods. The discovery of the Latimeria, or the \\"coelacanth\\" as it is more commonly known, shook the foundations of evolutionary biology and eventually led to groundbreaking advancements in our understanding of the aquatic and terrestrial branches of the Tree of Life. Moving on to another fascinating creature, the salamander, we can see that they share a common ancestry with newts, collectively classified under the order Caudata or Urodela within the class of amphibians. Salamanders, with their long, slender bodies and short limbs, bear a striking resemblance to their newt cousins and both groups are primarily characterized by their unique ability to regenerate lost limbs and other body parts. This astonishing capability of regeneration continues to captivate scientists, who are tirelessly working to unlock the genetic secrets behind this incredible process. Undeniably, the realm of biology is brimming with constant discoveries, surprises, and opportunities to expand our knowledge about the immense diversity of life on this planet. The stories of the Latimeria and the salamander serve as prime examples of such revelations, reminding us that the more we learn about the natural world, the more we realize just how much there is left to uncover."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine which town has more people that caught the flu. The paragraph mentions that Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, while Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases.

A scientist in the lab desperately warns them against releasing the captive chimpanzees, which are infected with a highly contagious rage-inducing virus. Ignoring his pleas, the activists release a chimp, which infects a female activist. She then attacks and infects everyone else present. 28 days later, in London, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma in St Thomas' Hospital. He finds the entire hospital deserted. He wanders the streets of London, finding it deserted as well, with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim enters a church and finds a priest, who turns out to be infected. Jim flees, attracting attention of more infected, but Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) rescue him. At one of their safehouses, they explain to Jim that while he was in a coma, a virus spread among the populace, resulting in societal collapse. They claim the virus has been reported in Paris and New York City as well, suggesting the infection has spread worldwide. The next day, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford, where he discovers they committed suicide in bed together. That night, the three are attacked by more infected.

Background: Edgar Yipsel \\"Yip\\" Harburg (born Isidore Hochberg, Yiddish: ysydvr hvkbrg; April 8, 1896 - March 5, 1981) was an American popular song lyricist who worked with many well-known composers. He wrote the lyrics to the standards \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" Context: Harburg, the youngest of four surviving children (out of ten), was born Isidore Hochberg on the Lower East Side of New York City on April 8, 1896. His parents, Lewis Hochberg and Mary Ricing, were Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Russia. He later adopted the name Edgar Harburg, and came to be best known as Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg. He attended Townsend Harris High School, where he and Ira Gershwin, who met over a shared fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan, worked on the school paper and became lifelong friends. According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father, a \\"democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people, that 'humor is an act of courage' and dissent\\". After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg \\"anywhere from 50,000 - 70,000 in debt,\\" which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics. Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (Earl Carroll's Sketchbook): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including Americana in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia. This song swept the nation, becoming an anthem of the Great Depression. Harburg was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist. He wrote a poem entitled \\"Atheist\\" that summarized his views on god and religion. Question: What was the first song he wrote?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The first song that Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg wrote is not explicitly mentioned in the given information. However, it is clear that his career as a lyricist took off after agreeing with Ira Gershwin and being introduced to Jay Gorney. One of their early collaborations was working on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway revue called Earl Carroll's Sketchbook. Although it might not be the first song he wrote, the most notable early work in his career is the song \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" which he wrote the lyrics for in 1932, as part of the revue Americana. This song became an anthem of the Great Depression and propelled Harburg's career as a successful lyricist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Information: - Lieutenant-General Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov (10 November 1919 23 December 2013) was a Russian general, inventor, military engineer, writer and small arms designer. He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the PK machine gun. - An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle. - Vladimir Oblast (\\"Vladimirskaya oblast\\") is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Vladimir, which is located east of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, the oblast's population was 1,443,693. - The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova\\". - The AK-74 (Russian: or \\"Kalashnikov automatic rifle model 1974\\") is an assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Russian designer Mikhail Kalashnikov as the replacement for the earlier AKM (itself a refined version of the AK-47). It uses a smaller 5.45×39mm cartridge, replacing the 7.62×39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons. - The AEK - 971 is a Soviet / Russian selective fire assault rifle that was developed at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant ( KMZ ) by chief designer Sergey Koksharov in the late 1970s and 1980s . The primary model , the AEK - 971 , uses the 5.45 × 39mm round fed from standard 30 - round or larger box magazines used by the AK - 74 , AK - 74M , and similar weapons . - The 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 by the Soviet Union for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented, then largely replaced the 7.62×39mm round in service. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - An intermediate cartridge is a rifle/carbine cartridge that is less powerful than typical full-power battle rifle cartridges, such as the .303 British, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92×57mm Mauser or .30-06 Springfield, but still has significantly longer effective range than pistol cartridges. As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of , which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in modern combat. This allowed for the development of the assault rifle, a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles that fire full power cartridges. The first intermediate cartridge to see widespread service was the German 7.92×33mm Kurz used in the StG 44. Other notable examples include the Soviet 7.62×39mm used in the AK-47 and AKM series, and the American 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge first used in the M16. - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\". - Sergey Ivanovich Koksharov ( ) is a Russian firearm designer working for the \\"Kovrov Mechanical Plant\\" ( ). He is most well known for his rifle design, the AEK-971, having variants for 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm and 7.62×39mm rounds. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire. - The AKM (\\"Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy\\" or \\"Kalashnikov modernized automatic rifle\\") is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is a common modernized variant of the AK-47 rifle developed in the 1940s. - Kovrov is a city in Vladimir Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Klyazma River (a tributary of the Oka).

Question: \\"How did Galileo record Neptune's location?\\" Context: \\"Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Galileo recorded Neptune's location by observing the night sky through his telescope and creating drawings of the celestial objects he saw, specifically on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his scooter—is called acceleration . Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. The greater the net force acting on the object, the greater its acceleration will be, but the mass of the object also affects its acceleration. The smaller its mass is, the greater its acceleration for a given amount of force. Newton’s second law of motion summarizes these relationships. According to this law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass. This can be represented by the equation:.

To tie an overhand knot,","completion":"Tying an overhand knot is a simple yet versatile knot that can be used in various applications, such as creating a stopper in a rope, attaching two cords together, or forming a loop. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help someone accomplish the goal of tying an overhand knot: 1. Gather materials: First, the person will need a rope, cord, or string of a suitable length and thickness for their intended purpose. They should ensure that the material is in good condition, without any frays or damage that could compromise the knot's integrity. 2. Find the working end: The person will need to identify the \\"working end\\" of the rope. This is the end that will be used to create the knot, while the rest of the cord is referred to as the \\"standing part.\\" 3. Create a loop: To begin, the individual should hold the working end of the rope in their dominant hand (e.g., right hand for right-handed people). Next, they will need to make a loop by crossing the working end over the standing part of the rope. The working end should be on top of the standing part. 4. Pass the working end through the loop: The person will now have to carefully pass the working end of the rope through the loop they've just created. First, they should ensure that the loop is still open and not too tight. They can then use their non-dominant hand to hold the loop in place. Meanwhile, their dominant hand will push the working end of the rope through the loop from the side near the standing part, moving towards the open end of the loop. 5. Tighten the knot: At this point, the basic structure of the overhand knot has been created, but it needs to be tightened. The person should grasp the working end with one hand and the standing part with the other hand, then pull both ends away from each other. This will cause the knot to tighten and take its final shape. It's essential to tighten the knot evenly and check for any twists or kinks that might weaken it. 6. Inspect the knot: The person should carefully examine the finished overhand knot to ensure that it's correctly tied and secure. The knot should look like a simple loop with the working end and standing part running parallel to each other, and no twists or kinks. If the knot doesn't appear to be tied correctly, it’s advisable to undo it and repeat the process from the beginning. 7. Adjust the knot, if necessary: If the person needs to adjust the size, position, or tightness of their overhand knot, they should do so carefully. To enlarge or reduce the size of the loop, they can gently slide the knot along the standing part and re-tighten it. To loosen or tighten the knot itself, they will need to gradually adjust both the working end and the standing part simultaneously to ensure even tension. 8. Further applications: Now that the person has successfully tied an overhand knot, they can use this basic knot for various purposes or move onto more advanced knot-tying techniques. For example, they can tie an overhand knot near the end of a rope to create a stopper or tie two ropes together with a double overhand knot (also known as a high-strung knot). By following these detailed steps, someone can easily learn how to tie an overhand knot and gain a solid foundation in basic knot-tying skills."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A. get to work B. stress C. use gas D. speeding ticket E. get depreciation The best answer is Answer:","completion":"When you're driving to work, a number of things can happen to your car, but the best answer drawn from the given options is E – get depreciation. While the other options A, C, and D might be immediate occurrences or effects on the car, they don't provide a comprehensive understanding of the longer-term impact on your vehicle. Option B – stress, appears to be related to the driver rather than the car. Now let's delve deeper into why depreciation is the best answer. Depreciation refers to the loss in value of an asset over time due to factors such as age, wear and tear, or mileage. In the case of a car, depreciation is the most significant cost factor over its lifetime and affects its resale value. When you drive to work, the additional mileage and wear on your car contribute to its depreciation. Mileage: The number of miles a car has been driven is an important factor in determining its value. It is often used to gauge the overall condition of the car, with lower mileage vehicles generally being considered more valuable as they are expected to have a longer remaining life. When you drive to work daily, your car accumulates miles, reducing its resale value over time. Wear and tear: As you drive your car, it experiences wear and tear, which can manifest as mechanical problems, cosmetic damage, or significant functional issues. Regular work commutes expose your car to different road conditions and the elements, leading to paint damage, upholstery wear, dings, and dents. These all contribute to the decline in your car's resale value. Maintenance: As your car accumulates miles and wear, it will require more frequent and sometimes costly maintenance or repairs. Driving to work daily increases this likelihood, as it exposes your car to potential hazards and issues. Regular maintenance and repair work are essential to keep your car running smoothly, but they also add to the long-term cost of car ownership. Other factors, such as the make and model of your car, its age, and the market demand for similar vehicles, also influence depreciation. However, the most direct result of driving to work is the accumulation of mileage and wear and tear on your car, leading to a decrease in its value. Thus, among the given options, 'get depreciation' is the answer that best encapsulates the most significant impact of driving your car to work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"It would have been easy to cry foul\\" When we say it would have been easy to cry foul, we are suggesting that there is a situation where one could easily claim or argue that something was unjust, unfair, or not within the agreed-upon rules. This statement implies that there was a possibility of a violation or breach that led people to think about raising objections. However, this doesn't necessarily prove any wrongdoing. It just indicates the presence of suspicion or the potential to argue on that front. Hypothesis: \\"Someone cheated\\" The hypothesis states that someone actually cheated, meaning they intentionally committed an action that goes against the established rules or principles of fairness in the context of the situation. Unlike the premise, this statement aims to confirm that wrongdoing occurred, painting a more conclusive picture. Looking at the relationship between the two statements, it is evident that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests the existence of a situation wherein one could easily argue about an unfair or unjust act, but it does not provide any conclusive evidence or confirmation that someone cheated. The hypothesis, on the other hand, outright states that someone committed an act of cheating. In simpler terms, while the premise introduces the possibility of a foul play, the hypothesis asserts its occurrence. These statements are related but are not entailed by each other. There might be instances where it would be easy to cry foul without actual cheating happening and vice versa. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"someone cheated\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"it would have been easy to cry foul,\\" since the premise only establishes a situation where foul play could be suspected but does not necessarily confirm its occurrence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Twista is probably the fastest rapper in the business and it is definately a breath of fresh air in comparison to the huge number of slow, raspy, mumbling rappers of late. No doubt, the best beats of the album are the two songs produced by Kayne West, \\"Slow Jams\\" and \\"Overnight Celebrity.\\" The problem with this album, however, is huge inconsistencies with quality beats and extremely cliched songs such as \\"Like a 24\\" and \\"Badonkadonk.\\" If I hear the line \\"I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind\\" one more time in a song, I will shoot myself. The equally horrible \\"Hope\\" has some of the corniest and predictable lyrics I've ever heard (even with the great Cee-Lo on the track) and seems like a poor attempt to get even more radio play (on par with less corny, but still lousy 'Where's the Love' by BEP)!

Because of that , the family had run him out of the house over the objections of the grandmother and he was living on the street .","completion":"Both sentences convey the same general idea - that a person was kept away from his home by his family against the grandmother's wishes due to some circumstances ('because of that'). However, there are certain subtleties in meaning that do not make them exactly same. Here are those subtleties: 1. The first sentence suggests that the family kept him away from the home. It doesn't provide specifics on how this was done or what this person's living situation was after leaving home. 2. The second sentence, in contrast, details that the family 'ran him out of the house', which suggests a more active, possibly forceful removal from the home. It also adds that he now lives 'on the street' as a direct result of being run out. In other words, the first sentence is slightly vague about the extent of the family's actions and the person's subsequent circumstances, whereas the second sentence provides more explicit details about this.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later. The saddest thing is her daughter wasn’t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room. Tragic. Question: Why was Mum in agony Answer: Answer:","completion":"Mum was in agony due to her advanced stage of a horrible aggressive cancer that had ravaged her whole body. This type of cancer can lead not only to the deterioration of one's physical health, but also cause severe pain as it affects various organs, tissues, and bones. In addition to the cancer, Mum also had Alzheimer's, which might have made it more difficult for her to communicate her pain or understand her own condition. To manage her unbearable pain, Mum was receiving end of life care that involved administering strong pain relief medications regularly. These medications are crucial for a patient's comfort and well-being during their final days, especially when they are experiencing severe pain from a terminal illness like aggressive cancer. It is important to note that when a patient is receiving end of life care, the main goal is to keep them as comfortable as possible, even if the pain relief administered may have potential risks. In this case, the healthcare professionals had to administer the necessary pain relief to help Mum feel more comfortable, despite the relatives' objection due to their understanding of possible consequences. It is important to remember that healthcare providers are trained to make difficult decisions in the best interest of their patients, even when faced with emotionally charged situations or resistance from family members. In the end, Mum was given the pain relief, which allowed her to relax and pass away peacefully in her sleep."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Dissatisfied with police duty in Paris, he requests to be transferred and is assigned to the front in North Africa. He sees what the war has done to his captain (Maximilian Schell) and the captain's wife (May Britt), and he is sickened by their behavior. Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) and Noah Ackerman (Montgomery Clift) befriend each other during their U.S. Army draft physical examination and attend basic training together.They are then stationed in London. Michael is in show business and romantically involved with socialite Margaret Freemantle (Barbara Rush) who, coincidentally, in 1938 dated Christian in the Bavarian Alps where she spent her skiing vacation. She was upset by his Nazi beliefs and deserted him on New Year's Eve to return to Michael. Noah, who is Jewish and employed as a junior department store clerk, attends a party Michael throws, where he meets Hope Plowman (Hope Lange). She falls in love with him and introduces her fiancÃ© to her provincial father, who doesn't like Jews but has never met one. After a chat with Noah, the father approves of the marriage. In the service, a commanding officer and some of the tough guys in his company try to bully Noah and demonstrate their bigotry. Noah gains the respect of the enlisted men by standing up to them in a series of fist fights, even though he's much smaller and often badly hurt. Authorities however discover Noah's deprived situation, and court-martial his officer. Each of these soldiers comes to view the war differently. Christian is conflicted, hating what the war has done to his fellow Germans, but unable to escape from his role in it.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"Due to the legitimization, competitiveness, and new Las Vegas what were casinos force to do?\\" Response: \\"Casinos needed to assess their business model and become more competitive to survive\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Available choices: I. no; II. yes;","completion":"II. yes; The response to the question is factually correct because the passage states that with the legitimization of gambling and increased competition, casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. This means they needed to evaluate their business model and become more competitive to survive in the new environment. The other choice, \\"no,\\" is wrong because it contradicts the information given in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Nothing\\" correctly answer the question \\"What is left when the stack shrinks?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Nothing\\" doesn't correctly answer the question.

Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones.

Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly. Another way is to make producers responsible for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted.

I have to give this place 5 stars because no one in our party of 5 could find fault with anything . I was a little apprehensive about coming here with my dinner group since I had never been here before and the menu prices were somewhat cheap but it was recommended so I took a chance and made reservations. Not being a lover of prime rib I ordered the NY strip steak, medium on the inside, charred on the outside and that's exactly how it was served to me. The steak was intensly flavored, juicy and very tender. I was impressed. Bertha ordered liver and onions and said it was one of the best she'd ever had, tons of onions and bacon. Sandy had the beef medalions with a sauce to die for and she too liked it very much. Maureen loved her strip steak and remarked at how perfectly is was done, (medium rare). Jeannette was the only one who ordered the prime rib although she was afraid there would be a lot of fat as most prime rib cuts can be. Not so with this one. We were surprised at how well it was trimmed and she commented on on well it was prepared. Baked potatoes all around, separate dish, loads of butter and sour cream on the side. The salads were fresh, crisp and ample. My Caesar had a tad too much dressing but didn't stop me from finishing it. Maureen raved about her blue cheese dressing so naturally we all had to dip our forks into the pitcher and give it a taste. She was right, it was some of the best blue cheese ever with chunks of cheese. The price for my steak was 21.95 with soup, or salad, and potato. A bargain I thought. Take a look at the menu online and see for yourself how the prices range. Service was wonderful, we never had to ask for anything; one of the two servers we had was always aware that water needed filling, wine glasses needed re-filling, plates needed to be taken away, etc. Ambience was very nice, somewhat quiet, cozy and very comfortable chairs. We lingered for over an hour after finishing dinner. We all decided we would definitely return later this summer. Hope you give this place a try.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer' organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day. We were fortunate enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen. This was Greta Garbo's first American film. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene, it was necessary to leave much to the imagination. Modern audiences, for the most part, do not understand silent films Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy' and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period. Garbo, with all her subtlety, did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug. She exemplifies the truism that \`a picture is worth a thousand words.' Even though this is Garbo's first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: This was MGM filmmaking at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects  which by today's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing. The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for Garbo; it showcases her strengths, magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part. Her co-star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive, appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully. There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido' and Martha Mattox as Doña Bernarda Brull.' This is when the extraordinary cinematographer, William H. Daniels, met Garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was. Seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance, do not miss it.

One such project is the balloon drum. Essentially, a balloon drum is an ingenious, cost-effective, and enjoyable alternative to traditional drums, crafted from easily available materials. This simple yet versatile percussion instrument is an excellent option for both amateurs and experienced musicians, as well as for educational purposes. In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your very own balloon drum. Materials Needed 1. A soup pot or other drum body (preferably one with a wide and flat opening) 2. Balloons (preferably of various sizes and colors for different sound effects) 3. A pair of scissors 4. Clear packing tape or duct tape 5. Optional: A drumstick or any stick-like object to be used as a beater Procedure Step 1: Select a Suitable Drum Body Finding the right drum body is the first and most critical step in constructing your balloon drum. A soup pot or any other metal or plastic container with a wide, flat opening will work best for this purpose. Make sure the chosen drum body is stable and does not have any sharp edges or rough surfaces that could puncture the balloon. Large coffee cans, popcorn tins, and even plastic buckets can also be used as alternative drum bodies. Step 2: Acquire and Prepare Your Balloons After identifying a suitable drum body, the next step is to prepare the balloons, which will act as the drumhead. Select balloons of various sizes and thicknesses. Thicker balloons will produce deeper and more resonant sounds, while thinner ones will generate higher frequencies and pitch. You can also choose between latex and non-latex balloons based on personal preference and desired sound. Once you've chosen your balloons, carefully inflate them to ensure there are no holes or defects. Experiment with various levels of inflation to alter the sound outcome. Do not overinflate the balloons; a moderate amount of air should suffice. Step 3: Cover the Opening Once you've inflated your balloons, take your chosen balloon and stretch it evenly over the opening of the drum body. Make sure the balloon covers the entire surface without any creases or wrinkles. It is crucial to maintain an even tension across the entire drumhead to achieve a balanced and pleasing tone. The balloon should be pulled taut, but not excessively tight. Remember that the tension and thickness of the balloon will have a direct impact on the sound produced by your DIY drum. Step 4: Secure the Drum Surface with Tape After the balloon has been correctly positioned over the drum body, use clear packing tape or duct tape to secure the balloon in place. Apply tape around the rim of the drum, ensuring it adheres firmly to the balloon drumhead and the edge of the drum body. Double-check that the tape is evenly wrapped around the entire circumference of the drum and hold the balloon securely. The goal is to create a stable playing surface that will not shift or deform during use. Step 5: Start Drumming! With the drum fully assembled, you're ready to start playing! You can use your hands, a pair of drumsticks, or any other stick-like object to strike the balloon drumhead. Be imaginative and explore the different sounds produced by varying the thickness and tension of the balloon drumhead, as well as the location of your strikes. Your DIY balloon drum is perfect for experimenting with rhythms, timbres, and dynamics. Unleash your creativity and enjoy the satisfaction of having crafted a DIY musical instrument. Conclusion Creating a balloon drum is an easy, fun, and affordable way to explore the world of percussion instruments. With countless potential variations in size, color, and sound, this versatile and portable drum is an engaging learning tool, an inventive musical expression, and a fascinating conversation piece. Enjoy the process of building your own unique balloon drum, and let it spark a lifetime of creative exploration in the captivating realm of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

Maria and Consolata Mwakikuti, who were joined at the abdomen, become minor celebrities in Tanzania where the media had closely followed their path through high school. Their admission to the Ruaha Catholic University in Iringa in September 2017 had marked a first in a country where disabled people are often marginalised or abandoned at birth. They had begun a course in education with a view to becoming teachers in history, English and Swahili, when they became ill in January, notably suffering from cardiac problems. \\"I am saddened by the death of twins, Maria and Consolata. When I last visited them at hospital they prayed for the nation. My condolences to their family... Rest in peace my children,\\" President John Magufuli tweeted. After an apparent improvement in their health, the sisters continued their treatment at a hospital near their university, where they died on Saturday. The twins were abandoned by their mother after the death of their father, and later taken in by a Catholic mission. In an emotional statement on state television last July, Maria urged parents not to \\"hide or lock up their handicapped children\\". \\"They must know they as human beings, handicapped or not, are equal and have the same rights,\\" she said. At the time, the sisters, who enjoyed knitting and cooking together, thanked the teachers who helped them through high school, as well as the government who provided a vehicle to take them from their home to school each day. \\"We didn't expect this day to come, it is by the grace of God that we are here today,\\" said Consolata, the chattier of the two, on their admission to university.

The women, who were joined from the navel downwards and shared organs like the liver and lungs, had two hearts and separate heads and arms. They were admitted to hospital in December due to issues relating to heart disease but died on Saturday. The twins were popular in Tanzania and the news has caused sadness nationwide. Many people took to social media on Sunday to send messages of condolence to the family and friends. Tanzanian President John Magufuli tweeted that he was \\"saddened\\" by their deaths, adding that Consolata and Maria had \\"dreamed of serving the nation\\". In an interview with the BBC last year, the twins said that after they had completed their university education, they wanted to become teachers. \\"We will teach using a projector and computers,\\" they said. Image caption The twins had said they hoped to marry one day People later remarked on their determination to acquire higher education qualifications regardless of a challenging system, which often found their condition hard to accommodate. They were able to continue their studies as they grew older thanks in part to funding from local government and private donations. Maria and Consolata, who were against the idea of being surgically separated, also told the BBC that they hoped to get married to one husband someday. The two, whose parents died while they were still infants, were raised by the Catholic charity Maria Consolata, which had adopted and named them.

The twins' health seemed to improve, and they continued their treatment at a hospital near their university, where they sadly passed away. Maria and Consolata were taken in by a Catholic mission after being abandoned by their mother following their father's death. Maria had made an emotional statement on state television, urging parents not to hide or lock up their disabled children, asserting that they have equal rights as human beings. The twins were well-loved in Tanzania, and their death has caused nationwide sadness. Messages of condolence have poured in from the public, with Tanzanian President John Magufuli expressing his sorrow at their passing and noting their dreams of serving the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. I am facing a new situation today: The city of Lampo is currently experiencing some soil piping in the ground. The government officials of Lampo are currently looking to start a casino to bring in extra revenue to the town. They are currently consulting with a company that is located in Himpton, a city that is not experiencing soil piping. The company is a well respected leader in the casino industry and is eager to work with Lampo. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are sink holes more or less likely to form in Lampo? The answer is:","completion":"Sink holes are more likely to form in Lampo. Step 1: Identifying the cause of the issue Based on the background information, soil piping is mentioned as the cause of sinkhole formation. In the given situation, Lampo is experiencing soil piping. Step 2: Understanding the effects of soil piping As per the background article, soil piping causes levee and dam failure, as well as sinkhole formation. This is due to the turbulent flow removing soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advancing up-gradient. Step 3: Comparing the situations in Lampo and Himpton Lampo is experiencing soil piping, while Himpton is not mentioned to have any soil piping issues. This implies that the probability of sinkhole formation is different between the two cities. Step 4: Drawing conclusions based on the given information Since Lampo is experiencing soil piping and the background article states that soil piping causes sinkhole formation, it can be concluded that sinkholes are more likely to form in Lampo as compared to Himpton, which is not experiencing soil piping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who retreated to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire? Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US.

In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\".

In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year? Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","completion":"Given the paragraph above, Rob would not observe quarrying effect or plucking this year.

Write an email with the following subject: SOME PEOPLE FOLLOW THEIR HEARTS..........OTHERS FOLLOW THEIR ASSETS Email:","completion":"Subject: Some People Follow Their Hearts... Others Follow Their Assets Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to explore a thought-provoking topic with you today, one that relates to the driving force behind our pursuits in life and the ultimate path to fulfillment. In this rat race we live in, we come across two distinct types of individuals: those who follow their hearts, and those who follow their assets. Both have their own justifications, and neither is inherently right or wrong. Let's examine these two approaches further. 1. Following Your Heart People who follow their hearts believe in the power of their passions, the impact of their dreams, and the importance of their values. They tend to prioritize happiness, personal growth, and their emotional well-being. This focus on fulfilling their life's purpose often leads them to accept greater risks and potential setbacks in the journey towards self-discovery. 2. Following Your Assets On the other hand, individuals who focus on their assets concentrate on the tangible aspects of life, like financial stability, career progression, and worldly achievements. They seek to build a strong foundation for themselves and their loved ones. These individuals find fulfillment in securities, and in some cases, material possessions. Finding the Right Balance Ultimately, what matters is striking the right balance between following your heart and your assets. If we solely prioritize material pursuits, we may overlook the tremendous value of personal growth and emotional well-being. Conversely, if we blindly chase our passions without considering our financial stability, we may find it difficult to withstand life's challenges. I encourage you to reflect on your own approach to life. Are you led more by your heart or your assets? Is there room for improvement or a re-evaluation of your priorities? Take a moment to consider where you stand and how you can work towards achieving a harmonious balance between the two. I would be delighted to hear your thoughts on this matter. Please feel free to share your perspective and experiences. Together, let's strive towards finding that ideal balance in our lives. Wishing you the best in all your endeavors, Warm regards, [Your Name]"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. Context: Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer. \\"Zidishu\\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the \\"Manchu Rhythm\\". Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \\"Helu\\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced. However, the Chinese monochord and crosstalk which derived from octagonal are still popular in Chinese society and the new generations. Many famous Chinese monochord performers and crosstalkers were the artists of octagonal drum, such as De Shoushan and Zhang Sanlu. Question: When was the drum first created?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The octagonal drum originated from the snare drum of the Eight-banner military, which was used during the battle of Jinchuan. The exact date of its creation is not mentioned, but the battle of Jinchuan took place between 1747 and 1776. So, the drum was first created sometime during that period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, you should not validate that answer, as it does not correctly address the question being asked. Instead, you can provide the following detailed answer to clarify the concept of a hosting company for a website: A hosting company, often referred to as a web hosting company or web hosting service provider, is a business that offers the tools, services, and technologies required to enable individuals and organizations to create and maintain a website that is accessible on the internet. These tools and services typically include server space, where website files and databases are stored, internet connectivity, and technical support to ensure the website remains available to visitors. There are different types of web hosting services provided by hosting companies to cater to the specific needs of businesses or individuals. Some popular types of web hosting services include: 1. Shared Hosting: This is where multiple websites share resources, such as server space, bandwidth, and processing power. It is generally an affordable option suitable for small websites with low to moderate traffic. 2. Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting: This type of hosting allocates a portion of a server's resources to a website, which is not shared with other websites. This offers more control over server settings and improved performance compared to shared hosting. 3. Dedicated Hosting: In this type of hosting, an entire server is dedicated to a single website or client. This offers maximum control, customization, and performance but is typically more expensive than other hosting options. 4. Cloud Hosting: This is a scalable hosting solution in a virtual environment that utilizes multiple connected servers to provide resources as needed. It's a flexible and cost-effective option that can handle significant traffic fluctuations. 5. Managed Hosting: This type of hosting is similar to VPS and dedicated hosting, but with the addition of the hosting company managing and maintaining the server, handling updates, and providing other technical support services. 6. WordPress Hosting: This is a specialized hosting service optimized specifically for WordPress websites, offering faster load times, improved security, and automatic updates. Personal website hosting can range from free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive options; typically, they use shared hosting services due to their affordability and ease of use. However, the provided answer does not accurately answer the question about what a hosting company is on a website. In conclusion, a hosting company on a website is a business that provides web hosting services to individuals and organizations, allowing their websites to be accessible on the internet.

The film is described as \\"imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality.\\" The usage of \\"imbued\\" conveys a sense of infusion or soaking-up, while \\"strong themes\\" suggests distinct and well-presented ideas in the movie.

Pick your answer from: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(A). Yes, the statement \\"In 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.\\" is indeed the correct answer. Gamal Abdel Nasser, who served as the President of Egypt from 1956 until his death, passed away on September 28, 1970. He was a crucial figure in the pan-Arabist movement and was the orchestrator of the 1952 coup that overthrew Egypt's monarchy, leading to the eventual establishment of a republic. Gamal Abdel Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria, Egypt. He played a significant role in the Egyptian army and was one of the founding members of the Free Officers Movement, a group of Egyptian nationalists working against British influence in Egypt and seeking to bring radical reforms to the country. After the successful coup in 1952, Nasser was initially appointed as the vice president of Egypt; however, he became the prime minister in 1954 and later assumed the presidency in 1956. During his tenure, Nasser brought about widespread social, economic, and political reforms that transformed Egypt. These included the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956, initiating land reforms, and introducing various industrialization efforts. His charisma and approach created an immense following in the Arab world. Gamal Abdel Nasser's tenure as the president was marked by several challenges and conflicts, including the Suez Crisis and Egypt's loss in the Six-Day War against Israel in 1967. Despite these setbacks, Nasser remained an influential figure in the Arab world and a symbol of pan-Arabism and anti-imperialism. Following Nasser's sudden death in 1970 due to a heart attack, his vice president Anwar Sadat assumed the presidency of Egypt. Sadat's administration took a different approach to governance, moving away from Nasser's socialist policies and opening up the Egyptian economy to foreign investment. Furthermore, Anwar Sadat played a significant role in establishing peace with Israel through the Camp David Accords in 1978, which eventually led to Egypt regaining the Sinai Peninsula and signing the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979. In summary, the statement \\"In 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat\\" is accurate, and the answer is (A). Yes. During his time in power, Gamal Abdel Nasser introduced far-reaching changes in Egypt and left a lasting impact on the political landscape of the Arab world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start the race at a steady, moderate pace. Keep a quick, even pace rather than alternating between a sprint and a jog. Relax your shoulder and face muscles so you don’t waste energy. Run with your teammates for encouragement. Article:","completion":"Title: Tips for a Successful and Fun Race Day Hello little friends! Today, I am going to share some helpful tips with you about how to have a successful and fun race. Running can be a lot of fun, and it can be even better when we know how to do it the right way! So, let's find out how we can run together better and have a great time! 1. Warm Up Before the Race Before we start racing, it's essential to warm up our bodies for about 30 minutes. Warming up helps our muscles get ready to run fast, and it can also prevent us from getting hurt. A light jog and stretching are perfect ways to warm up. A light jog means running slowly, and stretching means making our arms and legs longer to help our muscles get ready for the race. 2. Start the Race at a Steady, Moderate Pace When the race begins, it's important not to start running as fast as we can right away. Instead, we should run at a steady and moderate pace. A steady pace means running at the same speed, while a moderate pace means not going too fast or too slow; it's the perfect speed to help us finish the race! 3. Keep a Quick, Even Pace Throughout the Race While running, it's crucial to keep a quick, even pace. This means that we should continue running fast, but not too fast. Running too fast, like sprinting, can make us tired very quickly, and we might not finish the race. Instead, we should run at a quick speed that we can maintain from the beginning until the end of the race. 4. Relax Your Shoulder and Face Muscles Sometimes when we run, our shoulders and faces get tense without us noticing. It's essential to relax our shoulders and face muscles because tense muscles can waste our energy. We need all the energy we can get to finish the race! So, remember to check your shoulders and face while running and make sure they are relaxed. 5. Run With Your Teammates One of the best parts of running a race is doing it with our friends and teammates! Running with others can be very encouraging, as they can help us stay focused and motivated throughout the race. We can encourage each other, and it's way more fun when we run together! In conclusion, remember to warm up before the race with a light jog and stretching, start the race at a steady and moderate pace, maintain a quick and even pace, relax your shoulders and face muscles, and run with your teammates. By following these tips, you will have a successful and fun race day and enjoy this great activity with your friends! Now, go out there and have a fantastic race!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Joe unit, which is framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra. Snake Eyes and Jinx locate and capture Storm Shadow after a battle with ninjas and take him to Japan, where Storm Shadow reveals that Zartan murdered the Hard Master, and that he joined Cobra to avenge his uncle.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. They have plagued feet for centuries, but only now have physicists revealed what causes ingrown nails. Experts have come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. Experts have come up with mathematical formulae that describe how nails grow. These graphs show how the tilt of the nail changes when the adhesive molecules are not working efficiently (C), the probability that a bond is not keeping up with nail growth (D) and a representation of the force generated by a nail (E) Other factors, such as the thickness of the nail, biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails, influences their chances of getting ingrown nails. The University of Nottingham study solves a long-running mystery about why ingrown nails occur. Nails are made of dead skin cells, which are hardened by a protein called keratin. They grow outwards from the half-moon shaped ‘lunala’ at the base of the nail, but their progress of 0.1 to 0.2mm a day is kept in check by adhesive molecules that ‘stick’ the nail to the finger, Popsci reported. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. When this happens, a nail becomes wider at the top and curls round into the sensitive flesh to either side of the nail. Big toenails are prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape. Scientists looked at the mechanical stresses and energies associated with the nail, to come up with equations to explain nail growth. They show that when the balance between the nail’s growth stress and adhesive stress is broken – if a nail grows too quickly or slowly, or the number of adhesive structures changes – a residual stress across the entire nail can occur, causing it to change shape over time. The equations demonstrate that residual stress can occur in any fingernail or toenail; however, the stress is greater for nails that are larger in size and have a flatter edge, which explains why ingrown toe nails predominantly occur in the big toe. Experts say that the tiny, microscopic structures, which allow the nail to slide forwards, grow in a ‘ratchet-like’ fashion by continuously binding and unbinding to a nail. If the balance between adhesion and growth becomes unbalanced, the nail changes shape, and can become ingrown or spoon-shaped, according to research published in the journal, Physical Biology. Ingrown nails often occur in children, teenagers and pregnant women, when hormones cause a growth spurt of the nails, which extend into the sensitive flesh alongside them. Cyril Rauch, lead author of the study at the University of Nottingham, said that big toenails are particularly prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape. Scientists say that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. They warned that poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail, making problems like ingrown nails more likely. Their squareness means stress caused by walking is diverted to the tip of the nail, which gets wider to spread the load. The scientist says that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. Dr Rauch warns that regular poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail. ‘We suggest that nail beauty fanatics who trim their nails on a daily basis opt for straight or parabolic edges, as otherwise they may amplify the imbalance of stresses which could lead to a number of serious conditions,’ he says.

Read this: Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'.

The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies. People could also travel to the mainland by motorboat or water plane.

Nepal's last dancing bears rescued by wildlife groups in dramatic overnight raid Updated A dramatic rescue of two sloth bears was carried out overnight by the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, World Animal Protection and Nepali police. Key points: The once prevalent practice has almost been eradicated by wildlife groups To control the bears, hot needles are used to pierce the nose and thick ropes are inserted An estimated 22,000 bears are caged in bear bile farms in Asia World Animal Protection said these are the last two known illegal dancing bears in Nepal. \\"We are thrilled that the last two … dancing bears have been rescued from their lifetime of suffering,\\" said Manoj Gautam of the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal. \\"After a year of tracking them, using our own intelligence and in cooperation with local police, our hard effort and dedication has helped to bring an end to this illegal tradition in Nepal.\\" The bears — 19-year-old male Rangila and Sridevi, a 17-year-old female — were found in a distressed state and showed signs of psychological trauma such as cowering, pacing and paw sucking, the animal protection group said. The bears were taken to Amlekhgunj Forest and Wildlife Reserve for treatment. The bears were located by tracking the owners' mobile phones. Mary Hutton, founder of Australian based Free the Bears, described the trade in dancing bears as a \\"cruel\\" and \\"appalling business\\". \\"They are captured as cubs — the mother is usually killed to get to them — and then they are conditioned to behave themselves and obey,\\" Ms Hutton said. A hot needle is used to pierce the cubs' nose and rope is threaded through and used to control them, she said, adding that the holes are so large and so much pressure is applied from the thick ropes that they never fully heal. Through punishment and cruelty — which can include dragging the bears onto hot coals — they are trained to dance for tourists who pay a small fee for the entertainment, Ms Sutton said. Ms Hutton explained that bear owners are mostly living in poverty themselves, barely able to feed their own children, so the bears are usually fed as little as a few pieces of bread a day. But the good news is dancing bears are almost a thing of the past. Free the Bears were fundamental in wiping out bear dancing in India in a 15-year campaign that saw about 600 bears rescued. World Animal Protection have worked with local partners to eradicate the practice in Greece, Turkey and elsewhere. But while significant gains have been made to end bear dancing, there are still an estimated 22,000 Asian black bears caged in bile farms, where bile is milked from their gallbladder through a permanent hole. Other threats to all bear species include poaching, wildlife traps and habitation destruction. \\"It's extremely distressing to see animals being stolen from the wild and the sad reality is there are more wild animals suffering across the world, purely for the entertainment of tourists,\\" said Neil D'Cruze, Wildlife Technical Expert for World Animal Protection. \\"I am pleased that for these two sloth bears at least; a happy ending is finally in sight.\\" Topics: conservation, endangered-and-protected-species, animals, human-interest, nepal, asia First posted ||||| Bear rescue: We just saved Nepal’s last two ‘dancing bears’ Working with the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal and Nepali police, we rescued two tortured sloth bears, Rangila and Sridevi, on Tuesday night (19 December). They’re now on their way to Parsa National Park in Nepal, where they’ll be free from suffering These two bears are the last known Nepali-owned, illegal ‘dancing bears’. Rangila is a 19-year-old male and Sridevi is a 17-year-old female. They were sold to their owner to be used as dancing bears, and forced to entertain crowds of people. Bear dancing is a cruel and illegal practice. Video of rescuing_nepals_last_two_dancing_bears Bears like Rangila and Sridevi are snatched from their mothers at an early age and forced to perform. Painful ropes control the bears Their owner had pierced their noses with a burning hot rod and shoved a rope through it so he could control them. Harsh training methods are used on dancing bears to make them submissive enough to perform to tourists. From horror to safety With the help of local police, the bears were found in Iharbari, Nepal by tracking the owner’s mobile phone. The rescue was emotional for all involved. The bears were extremely distressed and showed signs of psychological trauma such as cowering, pacing and paw sucking. The bears are now on their way to be placed in the temporary care of Parsa National Park in Nepal. We’re proud to have made such an incredible rescue – this is an incredible way to end 2017. Nepal’s bear dancing trade is over This is not the first time an entire country’s use of bears for entertainment has been eradicated. We have a 20-year history of working with local partners to stop this awfully cruel practice, and have ended it in Greece, Turkey and India. We’re also close to phasing out bear baiting in Pakistan. Neil D’Cruze, our wildlife expert, said: \\"Rangira and Sridvei have suffered for too long in captivity since they were poached from the wild.\\" Manoj Gautam, Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, said: \\"We are thrilled that the last two known Nepali dancing bears have been rescued from their lifetime of suffering.\\" Our work protecting bears is not done The suffering of bears in Asia is still not over. We work to end the exploitation of bears used for the horrific blood sport of bear-baiting. We’re also working to end the cruel and unnecessary bear bile industry, in which approximately 22,000 Asiatic black bears are stuck in tiny cages. These captive animals have permanent holes in their stomach and are constantly milked for their bile. Please share this story with your friends on social media, and celebrate Rangila and Sridev’s incredible rescue. ||||| The longtime tradition of bear dancing, derided for its cruel training methods, is coming to an end in Nepal. Nepalese law enforcement, with the help of the Jane Goodall Institute Nepal and the London-based nonprofit World Animal Protection, recently removed two sloth bears named Rangeela and Sridevi from their handlers, Mohammad Salman and Mohammad Momtaz, members of the semi-nomadic Nat community that traditionally made a living with street performances. “Being there in person to help rescue the last known dancing bears in Nepal was surreal,” says Neil D’Cruze, global wildlife adviser at World Animal Protection. “We know that Rangeela and Sridevi were suffering in captivity since they [were] poached from the wild and their muzzles were pierced with hot iron rods.” Training bears of various species to dance for a paying audience was popular in the Middle Ages throughout Europe and Asia, and it remained common in Eastern Europe and Asia until the late 20th century, according to World Animal Protection. Due to concerted efforts by animal welfare groups to rescue the bears and help their owners transition to new livelihoods, the practice has been coming to an end. Countries including Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, India, Serbia, Turkey, and now Nepal are believed to no longer have dancing bears, but the practice continues in Pakistan. “The sad reality is there are more wild animals suffering across the world just to entertain people,” says Manoj Gautam, the executive director of Jane Goodall Institute Nepal. “However, for these two sloth bears at least, a happy ending is finally in sight.” Other organizations applaud the rescue. \\"The importance of this recent rescue, along with almost every bear rescue in 2017, is that these cruel animal practices, hidden behind the curtain of culture, are no longer accepted in a contemporary society,\\" says Claire LaFrance, head of communications for the nonprofit Four Paws U.S., which itself has helped end bear dancing in several countries. \\"Countries like India, Nepal and Vietnam, who continuously strive for modernity, and to be taken seriously on a global scale, must end these backwards practices that exploit animals for profit.\\" TRAINING BEARS Performing bears in Nepal are often poached from the wild and sold on the black market. In some cases, they’re taken as cubs—their mothers killed for the medicinal bile in their gall bladders or for their paws, which are served in an expensive soup or as traditional medicine. A cub is typically subdued and trained through cruel methods. Its muzzle is pierced and a rope or ring is run through the hole to control the bear. Sometimes canines are pulled or filed down and the claws removed to prevent injury to the owner. THE FIGHT TO STOP ILLEGAL BEAR TRAFFICKING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA The population of captive animals on \\"bear farms\\" in Laos has been increasing significantly in recent years, despite laws to protect the bears. Read more about bear farms in Laos on National Geographic's Wildlife Watch. Sloth bears are known to be aggressive, D'Cruze says, so forcing them into submission is a traumatizing process that often involves beating the bear with a stick. “There’s a constant use of fear and pain and aggression toward the animals,” says Gautam. Once trained, the bear is taken onto the street to perform for money. \\"Dancing bears, along with bears used as tourist attractions, for selfies, or near restaurants, suffer immensely,\\" says LeFrance of Four Paws. \\"In our work with large animals in captivity, we have witnessed private citizens generally lack the skills and knowledge to provide a species-appropriate home for a complex animal such as a bear.\\" THE RESCUE D’Cruze and Gautam had been following these bears and their owners for more than a year, waiting for the right time to mount a rescue. The plan was to approach the owners and convince them to give up the bears. But when Gautam and D’Cruze arrived at the bears’ last known location in remote town border town, they were nowhere to be found. “In the end, we got lucky,” says Gautam. “A high-tech team of police on the ground were able to trace the phone numbers of the bear owners.” The police confiscated the bears in the town of Iharbari, in southeastern Nepal, and apprehended four people, bringing them all to the district station. There will be no fines or arrests for those involved, but the bears’ owners were given a stern warning, according to Gautam, who witnessed the men's apprehension and its aftermath. The bears were traumatized but in decent health, given the fact that they’d only been eating milk and rice for years. “You could clearly see the stereotypic behavior, their psychological trauma. They were sucking their paws, jump up and down on benches,” Gautam says. Their teeth had been removed, which is common for dancing bears, but their claws were still intact. The bears are now awaiting transfer to a sanctuary, likely one in India. In the meantime, they’re living at a national park in Nepal—where two of the former owners have been hired to help care for them temporarily. Part of ending bear dancing is providing economic opportunities for the people who run the circuses—which is why the two men were given temporary jobs. The former owners “do understand there wasn’t much longevity left to this profession,” claims Gautam. According to Gautam, the men also signed legal documents that say if they’re ever again found with a bear, the punishment will be much harsher. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In a dramatic rescue carried out by the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, World Animal Protection, and Nepali police, the last two known illegal dancing bears in Nepal were saved.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In which region the plates would move, region A or region B? Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the plates would move in region A. Step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph states that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries and all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. 2. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move, and as they move, stresses build up. 3. When the stresses become too much for the rocks, they break and release energy, resulting in an earthquake. 4. Region A has many earthquakes, while region B does not have any earthquakes. 5. Since earthquakes occur where plates are moving and building up stress, the movement is occurring in region A."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Land of the Silver Apples is a fantasy novel for children , written by Nancy Farmer and published by Atheneum in 2007 .

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? from the following article ? In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. The answer is:","completion":"Ethan Step 1: Identify the key question, which is \\"What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham?\\" Step 2: Scan the text for relevant information.

Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.

This increased exposure results in that region receiving a greater amount of sunlight compared to other regions that are not tilted towards the sun or are tilted away from it. This phenomenon has a significant impact on a range of factors, including temperature, climate, and day length. For instance, during summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth's North Pole is tilted towards the sun, leading to longer days and warmer temperatures in that region. Conversely, during winter in the Southern Hemisphere, when the Earth's South Pole is tilted towards the sun, it experiences longer days and warmer temperatures.

Question 2: When u smoke crystal meth how long will it be to be able to pass a urine drug test? Pick your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Both Question 1 and Question 2 essentially aim to understand the duration of time crystal meth stays in the system and therefore determine when a urine drug test would be passed after consumption. Therefore, these questions can be considered as asking the same thing, and are directed towards obtaining similar understanding. To answer these questions more thoroughly, the duration that crystal meth, a highly addictive synthetic drug, remains in the system can vary greatly depending on multiple factors like the person’s metabolic rate, body mass, age, hydration level, physical activity, and overall health. Generally speaking, crystal meth can show up in a urine drug test for one to four days after use but could be detectable for up to a week in heavy users. It can be detected in a blood test for one to three days after use, by a hair follicle test for up to 90 days, and in a saliva test for 24 to 48 hours. However, attempting to dilute it in your system is hazardous and can lead to severe health consequences. It's important to note that dilution methods are unreliable and can be dangerous, potentially causing imbalance of essential electrolytes and lead to issues like heart problems or kidney failure. Furthermore, drug tests often check for signs of dilution (such as unusually clear urine or low levels of creatinine), and this can lead to an automatic fail or require you to retake the test. If you or someone you know is struggling with a substance use disorder, including methamphetamine addiction, it is advisable to seek professional help rather than relying on such methods. Efforts should be made to pursue reliable treatments and rehab programs that can safely help the individual towards recovery. Again, it's important to emphasize that illicit drugs like methamphetamine cause numerous health complications including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other health issues. These drugs are illegal in many jurisdictions due to their high potential for abuse and detrimental health effects. In the long-run, it's far more beneficial to one's health and wellbeing to simply stay away from misusing these dangerous substances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start with fresh eggs: Fresh eggs have strong shells, which helps them stay strong while boiling. 2. Let eggs warm up: If your eggs are in the refrigerator, take them out and let them sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. This helps the eggs to warm up gradually and avoid sudden temperature changes that can cause cracks. 3. Place eggs gently in the pot: Put a clean towel or paper towel at the bottom of the pot. This helps cushion the eggs so they don't bump into each other or the pot. Gently place the eggs on the towel. 4. Cover with cold water: Fill the pot with cold water so that it covers the eggs by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cold water helps the eggs to heat up slowly and evenly, reducing the chance of cracks. 5. Add a pinch of salt or vinegar: Adding a small amount of salt or vinegar to the water can help to strengthen the eggshells and prevent them from cracking. 6. Turn on the heat: Put the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Gradually heat the water until it reaches a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low so the water simmers. 7. Simmer for the right amount of time: Let the eggs simmer for about 12-15 minutes for hard-boiled eggs, or 6-8 minutes for soft-boiled eggs. 8. Use a spoon to scoop the eggs out of the pot when they are done cooking, and place them in a bowl of cold water. This stops the cooking process and helps the eggs cool down faster.

Sentence 1: Milosevic points to 1989. Sentence 2: Milosevic suggests the year 1989. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Both sentences convey essentially the same information—that Milosevic is referring to the year 1989. However, they do so in slightly different ways. To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, we need to analyze the contextual and semantic implications in each sentence. In sentence 1, which states \\"Milosevic points to 1989,\\" the verb \\"points\\" implies that Milosevic is either physically pointing to a representation of the year 1989 or metaphorically directing attention to the events or significance of that year. This sentence provides more vivid detail on how Milosevic is presenting the information about the year 1989, indicating an active and deliberate action on his part. The verb \\"points\\" suggests a stronger emphasis on the importance or relevance of the year in question. In sentence 2, \\"Milosevic suggests the year 1989,\\" the verb \\"suggests\\" indicates that Milosevic is merely offering the year 1989 as a potential point of reference or as an option for consideration. The verb \\"suggests\\" conveys a less assertive and less specific manner in presenting the information than \\"points.\\" This sentence leaves more room for interpretation regarding Milosevic's stance or motivation for discussing the year 1989. It is essential to highlight that both sentences revolve around the same subject: Milosevic and his reference to the year 1989. Hence, if we interpret these sentences more broadly and consider their primary message—that Milosevic is referring to 1989—then we can say that if sentence 1 is true, then sentence 2 is also true. However, given the more nuanced differences in the verbs \\"points\\" and \\"suggests,\\" some minor discrepancy may exist between the intentions and motivations behind Milosevic's reference to the year 1989 in each sentence. In conclusion, considering the core message of both sentences—that Milosevic is discussing the year 1989—if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can be considered true as well.

First and foremost, it appears that the narrator believes in exposing Trudi to new places and experiences, as they agree with the sentiment shared by the woman they met. This indicates that the narrator sees value in providing Trudi with opportunities to grow, learn, and become accustomed to different environments. By doing so, Trudi can become more adaptable, confident, and well-rounded.

Although the narrator was initially unsure if they should have been at the event, the positive feedback they received from others, including the GMO president and an audience member familiar with Bent's teaching methods, reassured them that bringing Trudi was indeed a good decision. Furthermore, by bringing Trudi to the event, the narrator may also have wanted to network and interact with other people in their community who share the same interests, such as the GMO president and those attending Bent's clinics. This can be advantageous as it allows the narrator to exchange ideas, experiences, and advice, in turn benefiting both Trudi and the narrator. Lastly, the narrator likely wanted to put into practice the skills and techniques they had learned from their time with Bent. By participating in an event like this, the narrator would have the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their training and how well Trudi is responding to it. In doing so, they can make any necessary adjustments and improvements in preparation for future events or competitions.

Choices: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"Those two questions are not the same, so the answer is 1). no. Now, let's address each question individually. 1) Why is my dog not eating food? There could be various reasons why a dog might not be eating its food. Some of the potential causes include: a) Medical issues: Your dog may be experiencing health problems that are affecting its appetite. Common medical issues that lead to a loss of appetite include toothache, gastrointestinal issues, or more serious conditions such as kidney or liver disease. If you suspect your dog may be suffering from a health issue, it's important to consult with your veterinarian. b) Stress or anxiety: Dogs can become stressed or anxious due to changes in their environment or routine, such as moving to a new home, introducing a new family member or pet, or loud noises from outside. These factors can contribute to a loss of appetite. c) Picky eating: Some dogs are inherently picky eaters, especially if they have been offered a variety of foods throughout their lives. If your dog has suddenly become less interested in its food, you can try offering a different type of food, or warming it up to make it more appetizing. d) Food quality or freshness: Check to see if the food you are offering is expired, has a strange odor, or is otherwise compromised in some way. This might be a reason your dog is refusing to eat it. e) Overfeeding or feeding too many treats: If you give your dog too many treats or table scraps, they may be less interested in eating their regular food due to being full or developing a preference for human food. To resolve this issue, observe your dog carefully for any signs of illness, and consult a veterinarian if you suspect a health problem. Consider your dog's environment and routine, and make adjustments as needed to minimize stress or anxiety. Experiment with different types and flavors of dog food, and monitor your pet's treat intake. 2) Can dogs in India eat spicy food? Dogs, regardless of whether they are in India or elsewhere, should not be given spicy food. Dogs have different digestive systems compared to humans and are more sensitive to certain ingredients and spices. Spicy food can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including diarrhea or vomiting, as well as irritation of the dog's mouth and throat. It's important to avoid feeding your dog foods that contain ingredients like chili peppers, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and others that are known to be spicy. While some dogs may tolerate small amounts of spicy foods without any significant issues, it's best to stick to foods that are specifically formulated for dogs to ensure they receive the appropriate nutrients and avoid potential digestive problems. In conclusion, your two questions address different topics: one is about a dog's loss of appetite, while the other concerns the safety of feeding spicy food to dogs. Both topics highlight the importance of being conscious of what we feed our canine companions and seeking professional advice when needed to ensure their overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Symptoms of work-related skin disorder can be varied, as varied as the causes themselves. In general, the hands, fingers, wrists, forearms, forehead, face, and V of the neck (or any place on the body in which skin may have come in direct contact or the dust or fumes of an allergen) are the most at risk of developing contact dermatitis, so look for symptoms on these areas first. Most often the symptoms will be isolated to a specific area of the skin. Symptoms may be immediate, or they may linger for a few days. Look for symptoms such as the following: Rash. Itching. Swelling. Bumps or blisters, sometimes filled with clear fluid. Hot or tender skin. Lesions. Burns. Skin discoloration. There are several predisposing factors that may make one more susceptible to work-related skin disease. Age. In general, younger workers are more inexperienced and more likely to take risks on the job site, which leaves them more prone to come into contact with harmful pathogens on the job site. Skin type. In general, lighter skin color is more susceptible to pathogens on the job site than a darker skin color. Pre-existing conditions. Pre-existing conditions may weaken your bodies immune system against unwanted pathogens. In addition, employees with chronic skin conditions (such as acne or rosacea) are more likely to develop skin reactions. Extreme temperatures and humidity. Very low or high humidity and extreme heat or cold can cause chapping and dryness of the skin, thus weakening your skin’s natural barriers against pathogens. Working conditions. A clean workplace is less likely to be contaminated with toxic or allergenic chemicals. In some industries, working conditions may expose you to chemicals, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Because work-related skin diseases are varied, each occupation carries its own risk. For example, medical professionals are more likely to develop immediate skin reactions from harmful agents such as radiation or solvents, and less likely to develop skin reactions that can take a long time to develop, such as exposure to sunlight or heat. Know the particular causes and risks associated with your profession, and the accompanying symptoms. For example, wearing rings is not advised for employees in so-called “wet work” (work that involves extensive exposure to moisture) because water and soap can collect under the rings and become a breeding ground for bacterial and fungal infections. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the symptoms, predisposing factors, and risks associated with work-related skin disorders.

A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon.

It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ...

Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues.

After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time.

We have the equation: 18 = 2*p - 20*p. First, we need to combine the terms with 'p' in them. So, let's see what happens when we add 2*p and -20*p: 2*p + (-20*p) = -18*p. So now our equation looks like this: 18 = -18*p. Next, we need to find what 'p' is. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -18. When we do that, we get this: 18 / -18 = -18*p / -18. This simplifies to: -1 = p. There you go! The solution to the equation is p = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Context: By 1261, the weakening of the Anglo-Norman Lordship had become manifest following a string of military defeats. In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by Edward Bruce in 1315-18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the Hundred Years' War and then by the Wars of the Roses . Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin. Question: How many years after the invasion for Edward Bruce did the Black Death arrive in Ireland? Answer:","completion":"The invasion by Edward Bruce in Ireland occurred in the years 1315-1318, and the Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. To calculate the difference in years: If we consider the end of the invasion in 1318: 1348 (year of Black Death arrival) - 1318 (end of invasion) = 30 years If we consider the beginning of the invasion in 1315: 1348 (year of Black Death arrival) - 1315 (beginning of invasion) = 33 years So, the Black Death arrived in Ireland 30 to 33 years after the invasion by Edward Bruce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic. Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs. The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection. An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder in response to the deficit. Blood loss anemias are fairly straightforward. In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms of anemia may be due to ulcers, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and some cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration and gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes. Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells. • A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell anemia).

Here are possible answers to this question: - store - office - cuba - photographs - pond I believe the correct choice is \\"pond\\", here's why: A:","completion":"While \\"pond\\" might seem like the most logical choice compared to the other options you've provided, it is essential to note that jellyfish are primarily found in oceans, seas, and coastal waters worldwide, rather than in ponds. However, there are some species of freshwater jellyfish found in lakes, rivers, and even ponds. So, while you can potentially find jellyfish in specific ponds, the more accurate description would be in oceans, seas, and coastal waters. To address the other options, here's why they are not the correct choice: - Store: Although some specialized pet stores or aquarium shops may sell jellyfish species for home aquariums, their natural habitat is not the store. - Office: This is not a natural habitat for jellyfish, and you would not typically find them in an office setting unless someone had a private aquarium within the office. - Cuba: While jellyfish can indeed be found in the waters around Cuba, the option itself only refers to a specific location rather than the habitat where you typically find jellyfish globally. - Photographs: You can find pictures and images of jellyfish in photographs, but this option is not a real-life location for the creatures.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town. Follow the railroad and take the first trail south.\\" Question: Why is Marlin looking for Kraamer? Answer: Possible answers: A). He is a friend of Marlin's B). not enough information C). He is wanted in connection to a crime D). He owes Marlin money The answer is:","completion":"B). not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"The fountain pen range that has a distinctive white star at the top of its cap is Montblanc's Meisterstück (also known as the Masterpiece) collection. Montblanc, a German manufacturer of luxury writing instruments, timepieces, leather goods, and other accessories, was founded in 1906 by three partners: Alfred Nehemias, August Eberstein, and Claus Johannes Voss. The Montblanc Meisterstück collection, first introduced in 1924, is the company's flagship line of fountain pens and is widely regarded as one of the finest ranges of writing instruments available. It features several sub-ranges, including the Meisterstück 149 (first introduced in 1952), the Meisterstück 146 (1949), and the Meisterstück 144 (1948), among others, each offering a different size, style, and functionality. Over the years, the Meisterstück has become a symbol of prestige, craftsmanship, and timeless design. The Montblanc emblem, which is a stylized representation of a six-pointed snowcap, was inspired by the majestic Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, and symbolizes the brand's commitment to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship. The white star emblem has become a distinctive and recognizable feature in the world of fine writing instruments. It is placed at the top of the cap, usually made of precious resin or metal, and can be found on all of the company's fountain pen ranges. In addition to its beautiful designs, the Montblanc Meisterstück collection is known for the fine craftsmanship that goes into every pen. These pens are made to provide a smooth writing experience and feature a 14k or 18k gold nib, depending on the model, often with a rhodium-plated finish, that offers durability, flexibility, and a continuous flow of ink. Furthermore, the nibs are available in different sizes (e.g., extra-fine, fine, medium, or broad) and can be customized to suit individual writing styles. The Montblanc Meisterstück collection has maintained its popularity, not only for the signature white star emblem but also for its attention to detail and commitment to high-quality materials. Each pen represents the perfect balance of tradition, innovation, and craftsmanship, leading to its enduring reputation as a luxurious writing instrument. So, for anyone seeking a fountain pen with prestige and a renowned design, the Montblanc Meisterstück range with its distinctive white star at the top of the cap remains an excellent choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:You are given a new situation: Ken is a microbiologist. He got two samples of yeasts, yeast A and yeast B, from two different businesses. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. He has to decide the characteristics of each yeast sample for further study. Interestingly, despite all his curiosity, Ken doesn't like any yeast to be around him. and a hint : Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. Please answer this question : Would yeast B be used as a leavening agent or not be used as a leavening agent? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. Ken has two yeast samples, yeast A and yeast B. 2. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. 3. The hint provided states that baker's yeast (commonly used for baking) and brewer's yeast (used for alcoholic fermentation) are the same species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but different strains. Now, let's analyze the question: - The question asks if yeast B would be used as a leavening agent. From the information given, we know that yeast B is used in a brewery, which implies that it is a strain of brewer's yeast. Brewer's yeast is a different strain than baker's yeast, which is used as a leavening agent for baking bread and bakery products. The primary function of brewer's yeast is to aid in the process of fermentation and alcohol production, not leavening. Thus, based on the information provided, yeast B would not be used as a leavening agent in baking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"exposure to which of the following can cause skin cancer?\\" is \\"some types of light bulbs\\", given that certain light bulbs may cause skin cancer? Answer:","completion":"The right answer to the question \\"exposure to which of the following can cause skin cancer?\\" depends on the context and options provided with the question. While it is true that certain types of light bulbs, specifically those emitting ultraviolet (UV) light, can contribute to an increased risk of skin cancer, it is probably not the first factor that would come to mind when discussing the causes of skin cancer. Skin cancer is primarily caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. This exposure can lead to DNA damage in the skin cells, potentially causing mutations that may result in malignant cells, eventually leading to skin cancer development. There are other risk factors as well, such as family history, a weakened immune system, and certain chemicals or substances, but exposure to UV radiation is considered the leading cause. However, given the factors you have specified, it is crucial to understand that not all light bulbs pose a risk. Most traditional incandescent and LED light bulbs do not emit a significant amount of UV radiation and therefore pose minimal risk for skin cancer development. The concern arises from light bulbs that emit UV radiation, such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), and even these pose a relatively low risk compared to direct sunlight exposure. CFLs are designed to produce visible light by using a small amount of UV light emitted by a mercury vapor discharge, which in turn excites a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass, producing visible light. The UV emissions from these bulbs are relatively low. Another source of artificial UV light would be tanning lamps, which can significantly increase the risk of skin cancer if used frequently and for extended periods. Tanning equipment, like sunlamps and tanning beds, emits UV radiation that has been proven to be a human carcinogen. Regular use of these artificial sources of UV light can significantly raise the chances of developing skin cancer, especially for individuals with a fair complexion and those who start using them at a younger age. In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that \\"some types of light bulbs\\" can cause an increased risk of skin cancer, this answer only holds true for specific types of light bulbs that emit UV radiation, such as CFLs and tanning lamps. It is essential to weigh this risk against other factors, such as sun exposure, and take appropriate precautions to protect oneself from skin cancer. This can include wearing sunscreen, minimizing exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours, avoiding tanning beds, and using UV-filtered light bulbs where appropriate. Additionally, regular skin self-examinations and medical check-ups can help detect early signs of skin cancer and improve the outcome of any potential treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What message, O poor sick body, who do you telegraph me through this globby gak? As we enter the depths of winter, a pair of videos from PBS Digital Studios’ Reactions and Gross Science have offered to enlighten us on the nature of nose nasties. So now, sit back as we sing the song of snot. Advertisement The usual snot runs clear, acting as a lubricant and the body’s first line of defense against viral and bacterial invaders. The nose’s so-called goblet cells produce proteins called mucins that link into chains, with sugars at their tips to help absorb water. Mucous is 95 percent water, in fact, while crusty boogers are simply snot sans moisture. A healthy individual makes a half a cup of snot per day, and swallows almost all of it. Bacteria-destroyling enzymes called lysozymes and white blood cell-beckoning antibodies live inside the goop to kill any intruders. But first line defenses can fail. A healthy individual makes a half a cup of snot per day, and swallows almost all of it. An allergic response might cause white blood cells to release histamines, signaling blood flow to the nose and causing your snot to run. An infection also sends blood to the nose, causing inflammation and a stuffy, congested feeling. Mucus could even pool in the sinus cavities, the air pockets in your face’s bone structure, building up pressure and triggering headaches. Advertisement Advertisement But snot doesn’t just get in the way when you’re sick—it plays an active role in helping you get better. First, the slime helps to trap and fight teeny terrors. White blood cells might join the fight, thickening the mucus and turning it white and opaque. And if your mucus has turned green, that means immune cells called neutrophils have released myeloperoxidase, an acid-producing enzyme that aids in bacterial slaughter. If your sick snot is red, that’s blood, so stop picking or blowing your nose for a while. Different medicines loosen up your nose’s mucus in different ways. Decongestants squeeze blood vessels in the nose, reducing inflammation by restricting the blood supply. Anithistamines, meanwhile, block the body’s histamines that signal for a runny response. Incredible snot, who knew you were so wonderful. Thank you for keeping me safe from the meanest of microbes, and keep on stuffing my nose so that I may stay healthy.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II? MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from Silver Creek, Colorado to his home in New York City, he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home. When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden, with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims she is his \\"number one fan\\" and talks a lot about him and his novels. As a reward for saving him, Paul gives Annie his new manuscript. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but apologizes. She buys a copy of Paul's most recently published book, Misery's Child, giving him praise. However, when she discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book, she flies into a rage. She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities; nobody knows where he is. Paul tries to escape from his room, but she has locked the door. The next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel titled Misery's Return, in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. He also tells her he will use Annie's name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health. When the first few chapters show continuity errors, Annie chides him angrily and forces him to start again. One day, Paul sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers.

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. I am facing a new situation today: James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection.

At the beginning of your bucket list planning stage, your goal is to find inspiration. You may already have a few goals in mind that you know you want to add to your bucket list, but you may be struggling to think of a few more to add.","completion":"To create a comprehensive summer bucket list, follow these steps: 1. Brainstorm ideas Begin by brainstorming a list of activities, experiences, and goals that you'd like to achieve during the summer season. This process may include thinking about places you'd like to visit, activities you'd like to participate in, skills you'd like to learn, or habits you'd like to develop. Write your ideas down, whether they are big or small. 2. Search for events in your city Do a search on the internet or local publications to find out about upcoming events and activities in your area. Some options to consider may include concerts, art exhibits, outdoor movie nights, sports events, food festivals, or outdoor markets. Additionally, consult social networks, parks, community centers, and libraries for more information about events and activities happening throughout the summer. 3. Consult friends and family Ask friends and family members for suggestions on what they think would be fun and exciting to add to your summer bucket list. People close to you may have some unique ideas that you wouldn't have thought of on your own. 4. Organize your list Once you have a good number of ideas, start organizing them into a final summer bucket list. Divide the list by different categories, such as indoor activities, outdoor activities, day trips, weekend trips, and so on. This will make it easier to plan out which activities to do on specific days or weekends based on factors like the weather, time availability, and budget. 5. Set specific goals For each item on your summer bucket list, set a goal or timeframe for when you'd like to complete it. This will provide you with greater motivation to achieve these activities and experiences before the summer season concludes. 6. Establish an approximate budget Many of the activities on your summer bucket list will have an associated cost, whether it be for transportation, admission, or renting equipment. Develop a rough budget estimate to help prioritize which activities to focus on and ensure that you can make the most of your summer. 7. Share your summer bucket list Share your summer bucket list with friends, family, or even on social media. By sharing your list, you may inspire others to create their own bucket list, and it may also motivate you to stick to your goals. 8. Track your progress Keep track of the activities you've completed from your summer bucket list. Consider taking photos or journaling your experiences as you work your way through various activities. This will serve as a record of your summer accomplishments and provide you with memories to look back on. 9. Be flexible Lastly, remember to be flexible with your summer bucket list. It's essential to adapt based on the weather, availability, or changes in your schedule. Some items on your list may not be feasible due to unforeseen circumstances, so be open to rearranging or substituting activities when needed. By following these steps to create a summer bucket list, you'll ensure a summer filled with unforgettable experiences, personal growth, and loads of fun.

Emery, the minority leader of the Assembly, and seven of his top aides will spend four days this week in the isolated and rustic Letchworth State Park, south of Rochester, in what one aide described as ''a retreat'' to plan Mr. Emery's governmental and political strategy for the coming year. The session will help Mr. Emery, who lives in nearby Geneseo, to make up his mind on risking his Assembly post to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination like his predecessor, Perry B. Duryea did - unsuccessfully. Mr. Emery and his staff will be meeting in a state residence known as ''the commissioner's cabin.'' A aide at the State Parks Department said there would be no charge for the meeting site. The Emery staff is also using a state plane to travel from Albany to Letchworth. Mr. Emery has certainly paved the way, if he decides to run. He hasat least five Republican county leaders on his Assembly staff, including Anthony Colavita, the Westchester chairman, and at least one Conservative county leader, Neil Greene of Suffolk. The Suffolk chairman, Anthony J. Prudenti, is not on the Emery payroll but has several allies on the staff. Their pay for at most part-time jobs - and some even less time than that - ranges from about 35,000 down to about 3,100 a year. The minority leader has also dipped into the ranks of former campaign aides for the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. They include Craig Thorne, George Humphreys, G. Collins Leyden and Joseph Persico, who was the Rockefeller speech writer. Their state salaries range from 19,942 to 54,288. Richard A. Bernstein, the Republican candidate for City Comptroller, says he still resides in Westchester County, although he established a voting residence on East 46th Street when he was designated by Republican county leaders last June. ''I live in Harrison - I live there now but I spend all my waking hours in the city,'' said Mr. Bernstein, who has already spent about 250,000 in advertising to make himself known to voters. He said that he would make the city his permanent residence if he were elected. The City Charter requires that the comptroller be a city resident. Alfred A. DelliBovi, the former Queens Assemblyman, has been appointed to a key patronage job in the Reagan Administration - regional director of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, which dispenses Federal mass transit aid. The post pays about 50,000. His most recent patronage post was on Assemblyman Emery's staff. Another Reagan supporter, Kieran O'Doherty, a founder of the Conservative Party, has been named Republican counsel to the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee at 51,000 a year. The post is viewed as a consolation prize for his losing an appointment as chairman of the United States Postal Rate Commission. President Reagan withdrew the nomination because of strong opposition within the commission to Mr. O'Doherty. Nassau County, which produced the largest vote of any county in the state last year, has a new Democratic county leader. He's Martin L. Mellman, a 62-year-old businessman and Port Washington resident who became active in poltiics because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. He was also affiliated with the liberal New Democratic Coalition and as such, is likely to be a liberal influence in state Democratic councils. Add three more names to the growing list of Republicans and Democrats who are tempted by Governor Carey's slump in the polls to run for Governor next year - either in a Democratic primary, if the Governor seeks renomination, or in the general election. The latest Democrats talking tough are Howard J. Samuels, who was a perennial candidate for Governor until he was defeated by Mr. Carey in the 1974 Democratic primary, and John S. Dyson, the outspoken chairman of the State Power Authority, who owes his job to the Governor. On the Republican side, Paul J. Curran, the former United States Attorney in Manhattan, said last week that he was ''considering getting involved.'' Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is one of those Democrats who might challenge Mr. Carey's renomination, said he is being scrupulous about an Oct. 21 fund-raising event at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel at which he hopes to net up to 75,000, at 500 a head. ''I don't want it running out of my office,'' he said. He added that he had set up an office at 330 West 42d Street and that Ell en Conovitz, of his staff, had come off the state payroll to run the event. Mr. Cuomo, who is known for fast speaking, said that he has also adopted a new personal style. ''My tongue is going to be a lot slower than my brain,'' he said. ''I've learned a lot. My opponents had an ally in the past - Cuomo. This time Cuomo is with me.'' Illustrations: photo of Assemblyman James L.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Leaves slapped his face but he kept walking into the woods. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a tiny baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it lifted its head with great effort to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the tap. Billy opened it and a small trickle came out. He knelt down, letting the drops slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on.

It's capital, Sapporo has hosted the winter olympics.","completion":"The most northerly island of Japan is Hokkaido. This island, the second largest among the Japanese archipelago, lies to the north of the main island of Honshu and stretches up towards Russia. Hokkaido's vast expanses of wilderness and unspoiled natural landscapes offer a unique contrast to the bustling urban centers of Japan's other major islands. Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo, has indeed hosted the Winter Olympics. The 1972 Winter Olympics were held in Sapporo, marking the first time that this prestigious international sporting event took place in Asia. Sapporo was chosen as the host city due to its excellent winter sports facilities, reliable snowfall, and well-developed infrastructure. The city, located in the western part of Hokkaido, has a population of nearly 2 million people and is the island's largest city. The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XI Olympic Winter Games, comprised a total of 35 events across 6 different sports, including alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, ski jumping, and speed skating. Athletes from 35 nations participated in the Games, with the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the United States emerging as the top performers. Hosting the Winter Olympics brought increased global recognition to Hokkaido and Sapporo, drawing attention to the region's natural beauty, renowned ski resorts, and unique cultural offerings. Hokkaido's abundant snowfall, coupled with its incredible landscape, has made the island a popular winter sports destination, both for professional athletes and recreational skiers and snowboarders from around the world. In addition to its outdoor attractions, Hokkaido also offers visitors a rich cultural experience. The island is home to the indigenous Ainu people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years and boast a unique culture influenced by their close relationship with the natural environment. Visitors can learn about the history and customs of the Ainu at various cultural centers, museums, and events across Hokkaido. In summary, Hokkaido is the most northerly island of Japan, known not only for its stunning landscapes and winter sports offerings but also for its rich cultural heritage. Its capital, Sapporo, hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972, bringing global recognition to the region and showcasing its beauty and attractions to the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Shadow Chancellor, who was last night forced to welcome David Cameron’s success in negotiating a lower EU budget in Brussels, said his party needed to be careful not to become ‘caricatured’ as the ‘pro-status quo’ party on the issue.

Commonly cardigans have buttons: a garment that is tied is instead considered a robe. A more modern version of the garment has no buttons and hangs open by design. By contrast, a pullover does not open in front but must be \\"pulled over\\" the head to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-knitted. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan.\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan.\\" The paragraph states that a cardigan is a type of knitted garment that has an open front, which can either have buttons or be designed to hang open without buttons. Meanwhile, a pullover does not have an open front and must be worn by being \\"pulled over\\" the head. The main distinction between a cardigan and a pullover lies in their construction and the way they are worn. A cardigan is characterized by its open front, which allows the wearer to easily put it on or take it off, and offers a more versatile and adjustable layering option. This design feature provides an opportunity for the wearer to style the cardigan in different ways, such as buttoning it up completely or leaving it partially or completely unbuttoned to showcase the clothing underneath. On the other hand, a pullover is crafted as a single continuous piece without any opening at the front. In order to wear a pullover, one must pull it over their head, which makes it less versatile in terms of styling compared to a cardigan. Pullovers are usually worn as a snugger and warmer outer layer, providing insulation and coverage. They tend to have a more casual and sporty appearance compared to cardigans, which can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. In summary, the statement \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan\\" is inaccurate. These two types of garments differ in their construction and manner of wearing, with cardigans featuring an open front and pullovers having a closed design that is pulled over the wearer's head. Each type of garment offers unique styling options and serves different purposes in terms of fashion and functionality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain.\\", does this mean that \\"People on a mountain.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain\\" does indeed imply that \\"People are on a mountain.\\" The original statement provides more specific details about the number of people (two) and the condition of the mountain being snow-covered. However, the general idea that there are people on a mountain still holds true in both statements. Let's break down the two statements further to explain the connection between them more thoroughly. 1. \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain.\\" This statement provides three crucial pieces of information: a. There are two people involved in the situation. b. The location is a mountain. c. The mountain is covered with snow. The statement explicitly mentions the number \\"two,\\" which suggests that there are precisely two individuals present. The description of the mountain being \\"snow-covered\\" adds an essential detail that defines the environmental conditions. This information may be important in understanding the situation more accurately, such as the potential challenges or hazards these individuals might face in their snowy surroundings. 2. \\"People are on a mountain.\\" This statement is a simplified and more general version of the original statement. It omits the specific details about the number of people present and the snow-covered condition of the mountain. Nonetheless, the main idea remains the same – there are people on a mountain. By stating \\"People are on a mountain,\\" we acknowledge that humans are present in the given location, which is a mountain. However, the scope of this statement becomes more expansive in comparison to the original one. The number of individuals can range from one to multiple people, and the conditions of the mountain are no longer restricted to being snow-covered. In conclusion, the statement \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain\\" does support the general idea that \\"People are on a mountain.\\" The original statement simply offers more explicit information about the number of people and the condition of the mountain, while the latter statement is broader and more inclusive of different possible scenarios."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A kitten is still learning what is \\"normal.\\" If it learns at a young age that being handled and being sociable is \\"normal,\\" it's more likely to be a sociable cat who's willing to be petted by strangers. Work on petting the cat all over. Start with strokes the cat enjoys, such as pats on the head, and work up to stroking it all over. Try holding its paw for a few seconds, as well as its tail. After holding it for a few seconds, reward it with petting it likes. Keep working on to petting and touching areas it doesn't like as much. If the cat gets mad, it's time to stop and try again later. Have strangers (to the cat) come into your home. Let the cat approach them first. When it does, let your friend try to pet it if the cat will let them. You can try to encourage interaction by giving your friend a treat to offer the cat or a toy the cat can play with. Give your kitten the chance to befriend other kittens. Some areas have kitten classes specifically designed to help you socialize your cat. However, if your area doesn't, consider taking your kitten to friends' houses, where you let them calmly hold the kitten. Tell them to pet it softly and talk to it in a calm voice. As an added bonus, this step will help your cat get used to riding in the car, and it won't just associate the car with going to the vet's office.

Background: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Paragraph: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces.

This might be called laziness, but Dr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle. During the hours when you labour through your work, you may say that you're \\"hot\\". That's true. The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak. For some people that peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening. No one has discovered why this is so, but it leads to such familiar monologues as \\"Get up , John ! You'll be late for work again !\\" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and-energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has. You can't change your energy cycle, but you can make your life fit it better. Habit can help. Dr. Kleitman believes. Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway. Counteract your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to .

What keeps Mars in orbit around the Sun? Select from: A). friction. B). gravity. C). magnetism. D). solar power.","completion":"The answer is B: Gravity. Mars, just like any other planet in the solar system, remains in orbit around the Sun due to the force of gravity or gravitational attraction. This force of gravity, which the Sun exerts on Mars and, indeed, on all bodies in the solar system, results from the mass of the Sun and the distance between the Sun and Mars. Let's explain further: Every object in the universe that has mass, whether it's a planet, a star, or even something as small as an apple, attracts every other object with a force known as gravity. This force was described by Sir Isaac Newton in his law of universal gravitation in 1687, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In the context of Mars and the Sun, the Sun, being substantially more massive than Mars or any other planet in our solar system, exerts a strong gravitational force which pulls objects towards its center. Mars, being affected by this gravitational pull, constantly falls towards the Sun. However, because Mars is also moving laterally (that is, sideways relative to the Sun) at a high speed, it doesn't fall straight into the Sun, but rather falls around it. This creates a balance between the Sun's gravitational force pulling Mars in, and the planet's momentum pushing it out and keeps Mars traveling in a nearly circular path around the Sun. This path is what we call an \\"orbit\\". Of course, gravity isn't the only force at work in our solar system. There's also the centrifugal force, which is an apparent force that acts outward on a body moving around a center, arising from the body's inertia. In the case of Mars and the Sun, the centrifugal force due to Mars' orbital motion counteracts the Sun's gravitational pull and, in the absence of any other forces, keeps Mars moving in its orbit instead of falling into the Sun. So the story of why Mars stays in orbit around the Sun is a tale of a delicate cosmic balance between gravity and inertia. To touch on the other options - friction, magnetism, and solar power - none of these have sufficient impact on a planet's orbit to keep it in place. Friction, for instance, is a force that opposes motion. It's experienced when two surfaces slide past each other. In a vacuum of space, where there is no atmosphere, friction does not affect the motion of planets. Magnetism, while a force that exists between bodies, doesn't have a significant role in maintaining a planet's orbit around the Sun. The Sun does have a magnetic field, as does Mars, but their effects are minor compared to the gravitational forces. Solar power, which is a form of energy derived from the Sun's radiation, also does not directly contribute to holding planets in their orbits. Although solar radiation does exert a pressure, the force it exerts is extremely small compared to gravity. Therefore, its influence on the orbit of a planet like Mars is negligible. The key force, therefore, is gravity - the force that makes the world, and indeed the universe, go around!"},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

How is \\"• 2.3 Planning in a Changing Environment\\" said in French?","completion":"In French, \\"2.3 Planning in a Changing Environment\\" can be translated to \\"2.3 Planification dans un environnement en évolution.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation for better understanding: - 'Planning': This term in English refers to the act of creating a plan or strategy, which aims to achieve specific goals and objectives. In French, it can be translated as 'Planification,' which is the act of organizing a series of activities, events, or tasks in a strategic and orderly manner. - 'Changing': In English, this adjective describes something undergoing some form of alteration or transformation. In French, it can be translated to 'en évolution.' This phrase denotes the ongoing process of growth, development, or change. - 'Environment': An environment refers to the external factors, conditions, or surroundings that influence an individual, system, or process. The term can be translated to 'environnement' in French. So, when we combine these words in French, we get \\"2.3 Planification dans un environnement en évolution,\\" which essentially means planning in a context that is continuously undergoing changes or transformations, thus requiring flexibility and adaptability to navigate successfully."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Usage: \\"He confirmed his suspicions and confronted Hawthorne\\" is the main clause. It is the main clause because it tells us the primary action happening in the sentence (i.e., the confirmation of suspicions and confrontation). Part #2: Determine the object of the main clause. Usage: \\"his suspicions\\" is the object. In this case, \\"his suspicions\\" is the object because it is what is being confirmed by the subject \\"he\\". Part #3: Identify whether the object is singular or plural. Usage: \\"suspicions\\" is plural. The object \\"suspicions\\" is plural because it refers to multiple suspicions, not just one. Part #4: Label the object as \\"Singular\\" or \\"Plural\\" based on your judgment. Usage: Label it as \\"Plural\\".

Options: [+] negative [+] positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful","completion":"To determine whether the phrase \\"ineffable, elusive, yet inexplicably powerful\\" is positive or negative, let's analyze each word step-by-step: 1. Ineffable: This word means something that is too great or extreme to be expressed in words. It usually has a positive connotation as it implies something extraordinary or beyond words. 2. Elusive: This word means difficult to find, catch, or achieve. It can have both positive and negative connotations depending on the context. In this phrase, it might suggest that the subject is hard to grasp or understand, which could be seen as either intriguing (positive) or frustrating (negative). 3. Inexplicably powerful: This part of the phrase indicates that something possesses great power without a clear or obvious explanation. This generally has a positive connotation, as it implies something mysterious and awe-inspiring. In conclusion, the phrase \\"ineffable, elusive, yet inexplicably powerful\\" has a mixture of positive and slightly ambiguous connotations.

She stands outside for a few seconds, before going in to the house. Shanks (Bobby Cannavale), the cop escorting her, tells her not to get used to fresh air. He lets her in to the hall, and Shanks tears off the police crime scene tape that had been left there. After they get inside, someone comes to fit her ankle bracelet, and they tell her she cannot move more than 100 feet from the detector in the hallway. Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles.

Q: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of single whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) session applied prior to submaximal exercise on the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the concentration of lipid peroxidation products, total oxidative status, and the level of cytokines in blood of volleyball players. The study group consisted of 18 male professional volleyball players, who were subjected to extremely cold air (-130°C) prior to exercise performed on cycloergometer. Blood samples were taken five times: before WBC, after WBC procedure, after exercise preceded by cryotherapy (WBC exercise), and before and after exercise without WBC (control exercise). The activity of catalase statistically significantly increased after control exercise. Moreover, the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was lower after WBC exercise than after control exercise (P < 0.001). After WBC exercise, the level of IL-6 and IL-1β was also lower (P < 0.001) than after control exercise. The obtained results may suggest that cryotherapy prior to exercise may have some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The relations between the level of studied oxidative stress and inflammatory markers may testify to the contribution of reactive oxygen species in cytokines release into the blood system in response to exercise and WBC.

Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.)

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Simon Corbell (born 21 November 1970) is a former Australian politician and Deputy Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. He was also Attorney-General, Minister for Health, Minister for the Environment and Minister for the Capital Metro. Hypothesis: Simon Corbell is a former politician because he was voted out of office.","completion":"While it is possible that Simon Corbell is a former politician due to being voted out of office, the context provided does not contain sufficient information to support or confirm this hypothesis. There could be a variety of reasons why a politician might no longer hold office, and merely stating that Corbell is a former politician does not identify the specific reason for his career transition. Let's consider alternative explanations, and discuss why the given hypothesis may not be definitive. 1. Voluntary retirement: Simon Corbell might have decided to retire from politics voluntarily after serving for a particular duration or accomplishing certain goals. It is not uncommon for politicians to leave office after several years, especially if they have a desire to explore other career opportunities or spend more time with their family. 2. Term limits: Some jurisdictions have term limits in place, which could limit the number of terms a politician can serve in a specific position or capacity. If this was the case, Corbell would have had to leave office regardless of his popularity or success as a politician. 3. Change in personal circumstances: A change in personal, health, or family circumstances may have led Corbell to step down from his political role. For example, he might have faced health issues that made it challenging to carry on with the demanding responsibilities of his role. Alternatively, he might have needed to support loved ones during a personal or family crisis. 4. Redirection of career: Corbell may have decided to redirect his career and focus on other opportunities that matched his skills and interests. He might have moved to another governmental position or even switched to the private sector to pursue other professional goals. 5. Losing party support: Politicians often need the support of their political party to run for office, and sometimes a party may decide to endorse another candidate for the position. In that case, the politician may still be active in the political sphere, but not in an elected capacity. In summary, while it is possible that Simon Corbell is a former politician because he was voted out of office, this hypothesis cannot be drawn conclusively from the provided context. The context only establishes that Corbell is a former politician and lists some of the roles he held in office. We would need more information to determine the specific reason for the end of his political career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

In the fanfily traditional cultural patterns confer (~z~,) leadership on one or both of the parents. In other cases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders, although there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment. Although leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of research have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of \\"natural leaders.\\" It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; rather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group. Furthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader, research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \\"get things done.\\" Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.

Consider the context: Lighting a match in a dark tunnel suggests that the primary goal is to improve visibility in the dim environment. 2. Evaluate the options: - Starting fire: While a match can be used to start a fire, in a dark tunnel, starting a fire may not be the primary purpose, as there is no information on any materials that need ignition. Moreover, a fire inside a tunnel could be dangerous. - Illumination: This is the most logical option, given the context. A match produces a small flame that can provide temporary light, making it easier to navigate the tunnel and improve visibility. - Heat: Although a match does produce heat, the amount is too small for providing significant warmth in a tunnel. Also, the match would burn out quickly, so the heat benefit would be minimal. - Making fire: This option is similar to \\"starting fire,\\" and faces the same issue that there's no mention of materials or reasons to start a fire. Plus, it has the same safety concerns. - Frustration: This choice doesn't seem as plausible, because lighting matches out of frustration is not a common or reasonable response to stress or dismay. 3.

Movie title: In the Valley of Elah Movie plot: The film tells the story of military police veteran Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon) and their search for their son Mike (Jonathan Tucker). A soldier recently returned from Iraq, Mike has suddenly gone missing. Deerfield's investigation is aided by a police detective (Charlize Theron), who becomes personally involved in the case. They find Mike's body, dismembered and burned. Military officials initially attempt to block the police investigation; they suggest Mike's death was due to drug-related violence. His platoon mates who last saw him, lie to Deerfield and the police. Deerfield tells the police that although he suspects the soldiers are lying about something, he believes they could not have killed their comrade. It turns out that Deerfield is wrong. The soldiers had killed and dismembered Mike after a seemingly insignificant quarrel. The soldier who confesses to Deerfield and the police seems emotionally detached from his words and actions, apparently to suggest he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder from events of the war.
