Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: An Interesting Biography with nice comic book interpretation of Kafka's works. Review: This book is a biography of Franz Kafka. Throughout the book we get summaries of Kafka's important works and we get to see Crumb's visual interpretation of these stories. That is the best part of the book for me. The biographical side is also very good, explaining a bit of why Kafka wrote like that.While reading the book, I felt like it is hard to call most of it a comic book, because it has a lot of prose. The parts of the book where we get to see Crumb interpret Kafka's stories definitely feel like a comic book, but the biography section doesn't. However, I thinks this works very well in the book, it makes the stories more alive when the images tell more than just being a drawing.I enjoyed the book, it is worth reading. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is positive. Step 1: Identify the key aspects being reviewed. In this case, the elements being reviewed are: - The comic book interpretation of Kafka's works - The biographical aspect of the book - The structure of the book, including the prose and comic elements - The experience of reading the book Step 2: Assess the reviewer's opinion on these aspects. The reviewer has expressed the following about the elements: - They found the visual interpretation of Kafka's stories to be the best part of the book. - The biographical side of the book was \\"very good.\\" - While acknowledging that not all parts felt like a comic book, the reviewer believes that this format works well and makes the stories more alive. - They enjoyed reading the book and found it worth reading. Step 3: Analyze the overall tone of the review. Since the reviewer has expressed predominantly positive opinions on the aspects being reviewed, the overall tone of the review is positive. They compliment the visual interpretation, biographical content, and structure of the book, and clearly state that they enjoyed the book and it is worth reading."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Options: A). no B). yes","completion":"A) No While both questions ask for differences between Catholicism and another Christian denomination, the religions compared with Catholicism are different. In the first question, the comparison is made with Episcopalianism, while in the second question, it's made with Lutheranism. Therefore, the questions do not have the same meaning. Now, let's discuss the main differences between Catholics and these two denominations. 1. Episcopalians (The Episcopal Church) and Catholics: The Episcopal Church is a part of the Anglican Communion, also known as the Church of England. It was created during the Reformation and is rooted in English Christianity. a. Authority: The most significant difference between Episcopalians and Catholics comes down to authority. Catholics believe the Pope is the highest authority on earth, while Episcopalians do not recognize papal authority. Episcopalians, rather, rely on the Book of Common Prayer to make important decisions together at general conventions. b. Sacraments: While both Episcopalians and Catholics recognize seven sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Matrimony, and Holy Orders), their interpretation and practice differ. The Catholic Church has stricter rules surrounding the sacraments. c. Women and Married Clergy: The Episcopal Church allows the ordination of women and married men, which the Roman Catholic Church does not. d. Views on Divorce: Additionally, Episcopalians generally have a more permissive view on divorce and remarriage in the church. 2. Lutherans and Catholics: Lutheranism was born from the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther, a German monk. a. Justification: One of the main distinctions lies in their beliefs about justification, or how people are saved. Catholics believe in justification by faith and works, which means that faith in God and performing good deeds are both necessary for salvation. Conversely, Lutherans believe in justification by faith alone, meaning faith in Jesus is all that's needed for salvation. b. Authority: Like Episcopalians, Lutherans also do not recognize the Pope as an authority figure. The Lutheran Church is democratic, with leaders elected from among the congregation by the congregation. c. Sacraments: Lutherans only recognize two sacraments—baptism and the Eucharist—as they believe these two were explicitly given by Jesus in the Bible. d. Clergy: The Lutheran Church, similar to the Episcopal Church, allows for the ordination of women and married individuals, whereas the Catholic Church permits only unmarried men to become priests. In conclusion, the questions do not have the same meaning as they address differences between Catholicism and two different Christian denominations, both with unique beliefs and practices."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: \\" When you sign a mortgage document, there's a promissory note that lenders are supposed to keep that details all the specifics of the loan agreement. During the housing boom, unscrupulous lenders underwrote so many loan documents and filed them away or sold them off, content simply to know they had made money. Now, many of the documents cannot be found, partly because they were sent off when the mortgage was securitized. The short story is this: if the lender cannot find the note, foreclosure can effectively be postponed, if not stopped completely. Keep in mind that the note should be available to download in your online account. Making the lender \\"produce the note\\" can be effective, especially if the lender used less-than-savory means of getting you to agree to the loan, but it's not a long term strategy for success. You can buy a lot of time if the lender can't produce the note, but in most cases you won't be able to stop foreclosure once the note is found. If you can manage to sell the house before the foreclosure of your home actually clears, you can keep whatever equity you still have invested in the home. It may be hard to sell your home on such a quick turnaround, but it's definitely possible, especially with the market heating up. Read here for more tips on how to sell your home quickly. When a property is about to be foreclosed on, a database attempts to make sure that the ownership of the mortgage — from the time you signed the papers up to the present moment — is clear and unambiguous. This way, the courts can recognize the legality of the foreclosure. Because so many mortgages were bundled into complex securities and traded on the marketplace, the chain of title is often not clear and ambiguous. If you can successfully question the database that keeps track of the chain of title, you may be able to keep your home. The database that keeps a record of the chain of title is called the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS. It was established specifically in order to track the chain of title, a tall task given the rate at which many mortgages were being securitized and then traded. But some courts are skeptical of MERS' legitimacy. One popular foreclosure defense rests on forcing the lender to independently verify the chain of title without using MERS. In order to save your home from foreclosure using the chain of title defense, you're probably going to need a lawyer. This may be a bit more expensive than some of the other options, but it's a defense that's quickly gaining traction. in lieu of foreclosure. If you have few other options, you can always ask the lender's loss mitigation department if they're willing to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This is a document where you legally agree to transfer ownership of the deed over to the lender in exchange for the ability to walk away owing nothing to the lender. If you don't think you'll be able to hold onto your house, this option can be especially attractive if you owe a significant amount on monthly payments in arrears. You may be able to negotiate a cash deal to cover some of your moving expenses. The lender usually provides several thousand dollars for this, so make sure to ask for it if you are returning the deed. Summary:","completion":"When signing a mortgage document, a promissory note detailing the loan agreement specifics should be maintained by the lender. However, during the housing boom, some lenders underwrote numerous loan documents and misplaced or sold them. If the lender cannot find the note, foreclosure might be postponed or potentially stopped. However, this isn't a long-term strategy, and foreclosure may still occur if the note is eventually found. Selling the house before foreclosure is an option to retain any remaining equity. Regarding the chain of title, the Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS) database is utilized to track ownership of mortgages and confirm the legality of foreclosures. Challenging the legitimacy of MERS in courts is gaining traction as a foreclosure defense. In this case, hiring a lawyer is beneficial to navigate the complexities. Lastly, homeowners can consider a deed in lieu of foreclosure, where they transfer ownership to the lender and walk away debt-free. This option may also include cash deals to cover moving expenses. Overall, multiple strategies exist to combat or mitigate foreclosure, and seeking legal advice is recommended to determine the best course of action."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of that which had become the most commonly used drilling fluid by 2009? Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

Cesc Fabregas faces Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates this weekend as Chelsea host the Gunners at Stamford Bridge. We asked Arsenal fan site Highbury House just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them, especially since he's been playing so well. If you wanted a symbol of the divide among Arsenal supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than Cesc Fabregas. There is an on-going debate, both within the Emirates and on the numerous websites devoted to the club, about Arsene Wenger and his continued tenure and Barcelona’s sale of Fabregas to Chelsea has rubbed salt into those wounds. For many of us, Cesc epitomised the great things Wenger achieved over so many years. He was the lingering ember, still smouldering in Barcelona, that so many Arsenal fans believed could re-ignite Wenger's reign and breathe quality back into a central midfield that had become dull. Cesc Fabregas (right) will line up for Jose Mourinho's high-flying Chelsea against Arsenal this weekend. Fabregas has been the driving force behind Chelsea's improved creativity and goal scoring this season. He never spoke badly of the club, even after forcing the move that hurt so many of us. I could see why he wanted to go at the time, though. Barcelona had exerted a strong pull under Pep Guardiola and it was Cesc's homeland. All the rumours about him refusing to play for us in pre-season and feigning injury were disturbing for sure but fans’ forgiveness tends to be in proportion to the player's quality and nobody could dispute Cesc had that in abundance. After the FA Cup success the word was that Wenger would push the boat out in the summer and sign the players that just about everybody in football knew we needed. So, when it became clear that the golden boy was available and Arsenal had a clause in his contract of sale that gave the club the right of first refusal, at a discount price, then what was the problem? Sign him, Arsene. The problem was that our manager didn't see it that way at all. Arsene Wenger played a key role in shaping Fabregas at Arsenal into the talented player you see today. Fabregas became club captain at Arsenal and is pictured here celebrating a goal with Robin van Persie. After several attempts Fabregas finally left Arsenal to return his boyhood club Barcelona in summer 2011. Now, whether this was for purely footballing reasons in that he didn't want to inhibit the growth of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey or, as Cesc has said, because of the presence of Mesut Ozil. Or was it a bit of rather ill-judged payback for some shoddy behaviour against the man who had made him the great player he undoubtedly is? But the awful fact of the matter is that Arsenal said no and took a percentage of the transfer fee to, of all clubs, Chelsea. Fabregas is showing the midfield creativity at Chelsea that Arsenal would have benefited from this season. Will Wenger's decision not to resign Fabregas come back to haunt Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this weekend? Those of us who have watched Mourinho's team through gritted teeth this season couldn't have failed to have noticed that he is doing rather well for them. In fact, he puts the opposition under pressure just about every time he gets the ball in their half. Unfortunately for us and in my opinion, Cesc was exactly the player we needed and as Wenger seems to see Ozil as a left-winger I really can't see the sense in not signing him. The sudden drop in Ramsey's form and his subsequent two-month injury, plus the inconsistent nature of Jack's game has made the decision look worse and worse with each passing day.

However, Wenger declined, and now Fabregas has become a driving force in Chelsea's success, causing Arsenal fans to question the decision not to sign him, especially as he could have provided the midfield creativity that Arsenal currently lacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: JACKMAN, Maine (AP) — Leaders in a Maine town say they will meet with their town manager, who has come under fire for espousing white separatist views. Jackman town manager Tom Kawczynski (kuh-ZIN-skee) recently made public comments bashing Islam and calling for preservation of white European heritage in northern New England. The Portland Press Herald reports local officials are scheduled to meet with him Tuesday. Town lawyer Warren Shay said Sunday the town manager's beliefs aren't shared by Jackman officials and \\"do not reflect the beliefs of the townspeople in general.\\" Kawczynski and Jackman town officials didn't return phone calls from The Associated Press. The Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce president says businesses in the area \\"do not condone\\" Kawczynski's views. Many social media users are calling for Kawczynski to quit or be fired. ||||| Jackman Town Manager Thomas Kawczynski said Saturday his days as an employee of the small northwestern Maine town are probably numbered after he came under fire Friday for his views on racial separation and anti-Islamic comments. But he said he has no plans to quit his job. Kawczynski also said he was sorry for any negative impact his views have had on the town and local businesses. He said he was not motivated by hate and denied being a racist. Related Headlines Maine town manager under fire for promoting white separatism Jackman Town Manager Tom Kawczynski poses in front of his New Albion flag. Photo coutesy Tom Kawczynski Meanwhile, Jackman selectmen remained silent Saturday about Kawczynski while the Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce Facebook page filled up with public comments about Kawczynski and his New Albion website. The chamber issued a statement Saturday condemning Kawczynski’s comments. Jackman, population 862, is in Somerset County near the Canadian border. The town bills itself as “a tourist friendly region” on its website. Kawczynski, who was hired in June, started posting his ideas on his website in November and has regularly posted anti-Islamic and anti-feminist comments on Gab, a social networking service associated with the far right. Kawczynski said living in northern Maine, where most people are white, allows him to “experience the joys of living in a monoculture.” He said he opposes Islam because it’s “not compatible with Western culture.” On the New Albion website he wrote, “I believe in all people, living as they choose, in free determination. For the people of New England, our folk are white people of European ancestry and ideas, emphasizing the value of work, communing with nature and a society based upon order. While I am not an absolutist on race understanding, the many complications created by the American system, I do believe to the extent we voluntarily separate, the happier every group will be as they regain self-determination.” He also attacked feminists on social media. “It’s no accident unattractive women make up the vast majority of feminists, ” he said on Gab this month. “Their issue is less with the roles men and women play, and more with resentment about the lack of attention they draw from men due to these attributes.” Kawczynski said in a telephone interview Saturday he had not heard from the selectmen or the town’s lawyer, Warren Shay, since the controversy erupted Friday. When reached by phone Saturday, Shay said he was not immediately ready to speak about the controversy. The town manager posted comments on Gab Saturday about his doubts that he would remain on the job. “I’m guessing I should be working on my resume as my public sector career looks likely to draw to a close in one form or another,” he wrote. “Do any gabbers need a smart writer who has plenty of skills to do independent work from home? I plan on writing a book about this all now.” Kawczynski said Saturday that he planned to fight for his right to free speech and did not intend to resign. He has created a crowd fund on the Hatreon website. Hatreon lacks the hate speech restrictions of other crowd funding websites. “Funds given to this project will serve to sustain Tom Kawczynski of New Albion during any legal fight about the effort to lose his job due to expressing free speech in support of Western Civilization, positive white identity, and against Islam,” the post on Hatreon said. Three of the four Jackman selectmen – Jayme French, Charles Lumbert and Scott Smith – did not respond to multiple phone calls and phone messages Saturday, while the fourth, Alan Duplessis, answered his phone to say: “We are working through our attorney. I can’t comment on that. We really appreciate you calling.” Gary Hall, president of the Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce, issued the following statement Saturday: “We the business community of Jackman, would like to state that we do not condone the current view of Tom Kawczynski. We believe in American values of freedom, diversity and inclusiveness. At this time, we are calling on our selectmen to take appropriate measures and protect our community for which so many have come to know and love. To ensure due process is followed, we ask for your patience as this issue is resolved.” When Kawczynski’s comments were reported in news stories Friday, critics pounced on his views. They included the Rev. Christina Sillari of First Parish Church, a Unitarian Universalist church in Portland. “It’s really awful what he’s doing,” she said. Kawczynski said Saturday his phone had been ringing continuously with anonymous hate calls. Kawczynski is a 2003 graduate of Swarthmore College, where he studied British history. He was a courier and legal clerk in Pennsylvania, where he tried to run for Congress. He last worked for a private contractor in New Hampshire. He grew up in Arizona. He said both his parents are deceased and he is the sole provider for his family. He said his wife suffers from Lyme disease. Kawczynski said New Albion is a reference to New England. Albion is the ancient name for Britain. The flag he designed for the New Albion organization, which features a golden tree and pine cones, is based on the St. Andrew’s Cross, which has its roots in Scotland, and is not based on the Confederate flag, Kawczynski said.

Dave Evans, born David Howell Evans on August 8, 1961, is an Irish musician, songwriter, and record producer. He is better known as The Edge and is a founding member, guitarist, and keyboardist of the globally renowned rock band, U2. Born in Barking, East London, Evans and his family moved to Dublin, Ireland, when he was young.

But the truth is, even here in Singapore, security cannot be taken for granted. It is a small nation that has no natural resources to speak of, even something as basic as water is constantly threatened to be cut off by Malaysia. Months after the September 11thattacks on US oil, a plot to bomb American soldiers near their military base in Singapore was uncovered by the local authorities. The United Nations has tried for more than half a century to architect peace for the world. But it has clearly failed. The grand horrors of the World Wars may have stopped but only in the forms they had existed before. When the enemy is unseen and there are no front lines, have we in fact created a more peaceful and secure place? Where have we gone wrong? Perhaps it is because the international body has never understood that peace was, is, and will never be something it can manage. Not recognizing this truth, the methods it provides are often short-lived and some even dangerous. Solutions for threatening situations tend to require the countries to carry out economic and political reforms so that they will become idealized democratic society like America or Britain. The UN fails to consider that hundreds of years of evolution gave rise to these strong democracies. So the result is further chaos and corruption, worse for all. Actually, an international organization or a government cannot possess peace to give away, but there are those who do possess it. Those who own peace are us, as individuals who cherish life, not our own but all others'. The act of achieving peace lies in us when we choose to respect social and cultural differences and appreciate that all our lives are fragile.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the given equation -23*p + 13*p + 30 = 0 for p, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms The equation involves two terms containing p (-23*p and 13*p). We'll combine them to simplify the equation. (-23 * p + 13 * p) = -10 * p So, the simplified equation becomes: -10 * p + 30 = 0 Step 2: Isolate p To solve for p, we need to isolate p in the equation. First, we will move the constant term to the other side of the equation by subtracting 30 from both sides. -10 * p = -30 Step 3: Solve for p Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is -10, to get the value of p. p = -30 / (-10) Step 4: Simplify Dividing -30 by -10 gives us: p = 3 So, the solution to the equation -23*p + 13*p + 30 = 0 for p is p = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Similar to starting any business, starting a home decorating business involves creating a solid business plan. Your business plan should include information such as the budget for your business, the type of clients you wish to have, and the medium you will use to reach your clients. Decide whether you will be a product-driven decorator or will be a consultant who does not sell products. There is room for both types of decorators in the industry. Remember to consider how and from where you will purchase your inventory, and don’t forget to include costs such as insurance and vehicle maintenance. You may need to consult with several specialists for help in this area, as requirements vary by state, county and municipality. Make sure you have the appropriate business license before decorating any homes on commission. The Department of State can provide you with the business licensing and permit requirements for you to start a business in different states. Keep in mind that these requirements may vary widely based on state. Consult an insurance agent to help you find the proper coverage to protect your personal assets from business liabilities. Talk to a tax professional to learn how to ensure that your company is paying the correct amount of taxes. See an attorney or consult the Department of State (for your state) for guidance in incorporating your company. Startup costs for decorating businesses are often relatively low and you likely won’t need a big budget to begin.Two must-haves are a good computer and reliable transportation that is also in good condition. Your basic startup costs will include the purchase of sample books, business cards, software, and promotional tools (such as brochures or any advertising you might like to do). You'll likely need to prepare a certain amount of working capital to start your decorating business. Unless you plan to work from a home office, you'll need to pay rent for an office space, electricity and internet access. You may need to pay for parking space for yourself and your future clients. A good business name will be something that is evocative, professional, and memorable. Thinking about choosing a name that is imaginative to show your clients your creative side. However, it's probably best to avoid a name that's too \\"cute\\" or trendy. Your business name should provide insight into the kind of professional work your interior decorating company will provide. Give your company name a lot of thought. Selecting a business name is one of the most important steps in planning your business. Don’t underestimate the power of your name. Some of the best names for businesses are simply a combination of your name and what you do; for example, “Jake Collins Decorating”. Advertising can follow many different paths. You may want to start spreading word of your business by word of mouth; to do this, you should speak with as many members of your community as possible. Let them know about your business and encourage them to contact you with any potential inquiries. Make sure you attend any markets or trade shows where people might be going to look for goods for their homes, and discuss your availability as an interior decorator. Once your business is official, you can start advertising in newspapers, on radio, or on television. This is a great way to spread information about your business without depending on word of mouth alone. You will reach a much larger audience this way. A great way to advertise your decorating business is by starting a website. You should fill this website with as many pictures as possible of your home designs and decorations. Other decorators and designers, as well as architects and real estate agents, may be able to offer you referrals. If there is any sort of builders or decorators guild in your area, join it to start connecting with other professionals in your line of work. Using social media is a great way to network with other professionals, and to promote your business. Keep an active blog so that people can see what you're doing in a day-to-day manner. Using your online presence to promote other people's work encourages them to promote your work as well. Summary:","completion":"Starting a home decorating business requires a solid business plan, including information on budget, client types, and marketing strategies. Decide on your role as a product-driven decorator or consultant and consider inventory sources and costs. Consult with specialists for licensing, insurance, tax, and incorporation requirements, as these may vary by location. Startup costs are typically low, with essential expenses being a good computer and reliable transportation. Select a professional and memorable business name, and use multiple advertising channels, such as word of mouth, print, radio, television, and web presence. Networking with other professionals and joining local guilds can also help generate referrals and grow your business."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Geoff McArthur, likely a former or current member of the team, observes that a short walk around the campus in summer is enough to showcase how much the football culture has evolved since his freshman year. The author mentions that the Golden Bears football team had only won a single game in the year 2001, which indicates that the team was struggling significantly during that time. Additionally, the team holds the longest Rose Bowl drought among all the Big Ten and Pac-10 teams, which means they have gone the longest time since participating in the prestigious Rose Bowl game, one of the major college football bowl games traditionally played between the champions of the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences. In the past, the school was more recognized for its history of protests and political activism, rather than its prowess on the football field.

Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement.

The emotions to choose from are: happy, sad, angry, or other. It is key to examine the language used in the text, consider the context, as well as any explicit emotions mentioned by the speaker. The guidelines provided are not specific, so you'll need to use your judgment and understanding of language and emotions to arrive at the appropriate response. You need to determine whether the person communicating seems to be in a state of happiness, sadness, anger, or another emotional state. Keep in mind that emotions can sometimes be complex, and there may be more than one emotion present in the text. Now let's apply these guidelines to the given input: \\"geve me a solution i didn't ask for a solution i don't have a problem i have no life no gf i feel suicidal\\" Start by looking at words and phrases that might indicate emotional state. You can see phrases such as \\"i didn't ask for a solution,\\" \\"i have no life,\\" \\"no gf,\\" and especially \\"i feel suicidal.\\" These phrases give us a clear indication that the speaker is not expressing happiness or anger. It is clear that this person is in a state of distress and is expressing a feeling of extreme sadness, possibly even depression, suicidal thoughts further indicate profound distress and emotional turmoil. Hence, the output for this input would be \\"sad.\\" Remember, interpreting emotions in text can be difficult due to lack of facial cues and tone of voice, it is important to carefully read and interpret the text to determine the underlying emotion.

Caught out: Radio presenter Burden has hit out over the BBC's move to Salford. Many BBC staff have never made a secret of their disdain for their new northern base. But one presenter has taken the sniping to a new level...by making an on-air joke accusing the Corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered. The gaffe came when BBC Five Live breakfast show host Rachel Burden was interviewing Olympic cycling hopeful Laura Trott, who won two gold medals at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, about her success. But when Miss Trott, 19, joked about accidentally leaving the medals in her car, Miss Burden quipped: ‘What? Around here?’ The suggestion that the car was at risk of being broken into caused fury among radio listeners in Salford, who help to pay 35-year-old Miss Burden’s wages through the licence fee and say the city is being unfairly reviled as a crime hotspot by BBC staff. Edward Reid, a legal worker, said of Tuesday’s interview: ‘It’s time presenters like Rachel kept their prejudices to themselves rather than airing them to listeners. She is employed to do a job, not pass snide remarks about an area which she knows little or next to nothing about. Grow up.’ Joanna Smith, 29, a clerical worker, said: ‘It’s just ignorance really. Salford does have a reputation as a hard city but so has London – they need to get a grip.’ Salford MP Hazel Blears said of Salford Quays, where the BBC is based: ‘I go down there on a regular basis and there’s always a lot of activity. It seems like a safe place to be. In any urban environment you get the odd incident.’ This week it emerged that BBC managers have offered staff in Salford personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios. However, crime rates for Shepherd’s Bush, home to the BBC’s White City London headquarters, are higher than in Salford, and its figures for violent crime and robbery are way above the national average. Furthermore, recent figures show that although Salford remains slightly above the national average for violence and robbery, crime there has dropped. The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced. Left behind: Laura Trott, centre, with her gold medal following at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north. Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford. But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000. ‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said. Double winner: Laura Trott with her Gold Medal after winning the Women's Omnium during day four of the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford. She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’ A spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.' Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford. Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios. And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’. In a move costing an estimated. £1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments. including Sport, Children’s and Radio 5 Live to the Media City site. BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut. on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the. programmes which air from the futuristic complex. Fears: The BBC's £200m Media City development in Salford. Staff were told that it was a 'different kettle of fish' from West London. Incidents there over the past year include:. The offer of personal security applies. particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning. In a leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian. Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said. the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff. ‘I’ve been looking at on-site security. on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the. reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’ The BBC’s buildings at White City have. private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter,. while the Tube station is yards away. Concerned: Rhian Roberts, left, head of development for BBC Radio 5 live and Sports Extra, said Salford was a 'different kettle of fish' to west London and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late. By contrast, the Salford Quays area. has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is. relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by. security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles. In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the. head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site –. said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff. Mr Chebrika. also reassured staff that the site had 300 CCTV cameras, guards on. constant patrol and a 24-hour control room. In spite of these precautions,. however, a wide range of crimes were reported by BBC employees since. last year including assault, spray-paint damage and thefts. Paul Newman, head of communications. for Peel Media, said that the Salford complex includes more than 50. commercial businesses – including Costa Coffee, Wagamama and Prezzo –. and 378 apartments. He said: ‘From day one our policy has. been to, on request, offer escorts to people who want to get to their. cars or the tram stop, particularly late at night.’ The crime rate has dropped in Salford. in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for. violent crime and robbery. Upping sticks: Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid present BBC Breakfast, just one of the programmes that has been forced to relocate to the north. Leafy: BBC Television Centre in White City, west London, where staff had previously been based before the move to Salford. Last year a student staying at a hotel in. Salford Quays was shot dead in what police described as an ‘unprovoked. attack’. However, crime rates for the Shepherd’s Bush area around White. City are higher than Salford and its figures for violent crime and. robbery are well above the national average. John Merry, leader of Salford City Council, yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city. ‘This is just scaremongering,’ he. said. ‘It is not unusual for complexes like MediaCityUK to have high. levels of security, whether in Salford, London or any other city.’ BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid. and Bill Turnbull were teased yesterday over their move to Salford. Shaun Ryder, of the Happy Mondays, said: ‘I only live four minutes away. ... great to have you on in the North.’ When Ryder started asking Turnbull. where exactly in Cheshire he would be living, the presenter replied:. ‘Careful’, acknowledging that the travel and residential arrangements of. BBC broadcasters in the North are intended to be kept off screen. Turnbull then joked: ‘All back to Shaun’s for some breakfast – he’s closest!’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1. BBC Five Live breakfast show host, Rachel Burden, made an on-air joke suggesting that Salford, the location of the BBC's new northern base, may have higher crime rates. The comment caused outrage among Salford residents who felt their city was being unfairly maligned. 2. Many BBC staff members have expressed disdain over the move to Salford and some, such as BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins, opted out of relocating. 3. Salford MP Hazel Blears defended the city and the BBC's Salford Quays location, stating that there is a lot of activity in the area and it feels safe. 4. BBC staff in Salford have been offered personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios, despite the fact that crime rates in Shepherd's Bush, London (the previous location of BBC headquarters) are higher than in Salford. 5. The relocation of the BBC to Salford's Media City site has cost an estimated £1.5 billion and involved moving 2,500 staff across five departments, including Sport, Children's, and Radio 5 Live. 6. The BBC apologized for Rachel Burden's comment, stating that it was an off-the-cuff remark and no offense was intended. In summary, the article discusses the controversy surrounding BBC's relocation to Salford and the on-air joke made by presenter Rachel Burden, which sparked anger among local residents. It also highlights the defensive stance of Salford MP Hazel Blears and the measures taken by the BBC to ensure staff safety at the Salford Quays location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

In the Chinese zodiac, years are represented by twelve different animals, and each animal is associated with a cycle of five elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Each full cycle of the zodiac takes 60 years to complete, as each animal sign combines with each of the five elements, creating a unique combination. The Chinese zodiac cycle begins with the Rat and proceeds in this order: Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. In 1998, the year fell under the Tiger. The combination of Tiger and Earth element creates an Earth Tiger year. Tigers are seen as brave, confident, strong, and independent creatures in Chinese culture. Individuals born in the Year of the Tiger are typically known for their charismatic and dynamic personality. They have a natural ability to lead and inspire others with their captivating presence. Being an Earth Tiger, people born in 1998 are expected to be more grounded, practical, and reliable than other Tiger counterparts. They possess the Tiger's natural courage and enthusiasm but are also responsible and attentive to their surroundings. Some notable individuals born in the Year of the Earth Tiger (1938 and 1998) include: 1. Michael Caine (born March 14, 1938) - A renowned British actor. 2. Natalie Wood (born July 20, 1938) - An American actress who reached fame during the mid-20th century. 3. Shawn Mendes (born August 8, 1998) - A Canadian singer-songwriter known for his hit songs, such as \\"Stitches\\" and \\"Treat You Better.\\" In conclusion, 1998 was the Chinese year of the Earth Tiger, a year that combined the natural strength and charisma of the Tiger with the stability and practicality of the Earth element."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Verve were an English rock band formed in Wigan in 1990 by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP The band's physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of the band's second album, 1995's A Northern Soul, produced by Owen Morris. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of A Storm in Heaven and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher, dedicated the song \\"Cast No Shadow\\" on the album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? to Ashcroft, and Ashcroft returned the gesture by dedicating the song \\"A Northern Soul\\" to Noel. The band released the album's first single \\"This Is Music\\" in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \\"On Your Own\\" in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \\"History\\", which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \\"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with \\"History\\" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away.\\" Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he spent only a couple of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances for all of 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York.

At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175.

When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft.

Write a title for this article: Grete Waitz, the Norwegian schoolteacher who won more New York City Marathons — nine — than anyone else, and whose humility and athleticism made her a singularly graceful champion and a role model for young runners, especially women, died Tuesday in Oslo. She was 57. Her death was confirmed by Helle Aanesen, the manager of Aktiv Mot Kreft (Active Against Cancer), the foundation Waitz founded in 2007. In 2005, Waitz had received a diagnosis of cancer, though she never publicly revealed what kind. She lived in Oslo, and she and her husband, Jack, also had a home in Gainesville, Fla. In 1991, Runner’s World magazine named Waitz the female runner of the quarter-century, and she was perhaps the pre-eminent female distance runner in history. She twice set the world record at 3,000 meters, and she set world records at distances of 8 kilometers, 10 kilometers, 15 kilometers and 10 miles. But it was in the marathon, the 26.2-mile symbol of human endurance, that Waitz most distinguished herself, setting a world record of 2 hours 32 minutes 30 seconds the first time she ran one, in New York in 1978, and subsequently lowering the world standard three more times. In addition to her New York City victories, Waitz won the London Marathon twice, the Stockholm Marathon once and the world championship marathon in 1983. “She is our sport’s towering legend,” said Mary Wittenberg, the president of the New York Road Runners. “I believe not only in New York, but around the world, marathoning is what it is today because of Grete. She was the first big time female track runner to step up to the marathon and change the whole sport.” Grete Waitz (whose name was pronounced GREH-tuh VITES) was not simply a champion, however; she was also something of a pioneer. At the time of her first New York victory, women’s distance running was a novelty. Just 938 out of 8,937 entrants in the 1978 New York marathon were women — in 2010, 16,253 of 45,350 entrants were — and the women’s marathon would not be added to the Olympics until the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where Waitz finished second to Joan Benoit Samuelson. “I lost a mentor and a role model,” Samuelson, 53, said Tuesday, a day after running the Boston Marathon in 2:51:29. She decided to run at the last minute, Samuelson said, because, although she had been battling back problems, she was inspired by Waitz’s courage. “What will endure forever is that she was able to balance a competitive career with the most gracious lifestyle, and a character that emanated good will,” Samuelson said. Remarkably, Waitz, a champion track runner, ran her first marathon as a lark, with the encouragement of her husband, who was also her coach, and who told her that a trip to New York would be like a second honeymoon for them. Even in training she had never run more than 13 miles, and the science of the sport was young enough that her dinner the night before the race included shrimp cocktail and filet mignon, hardly the load of carbohydrates that even today’s rankest amateurs know to consume. As she recalled in later interviews, the last 10 miles of the race were agony, and she was so angry at her husband that when she crossed the finish line, she tore off her shoes and flung them at him. “I’ll never do this stupid thing again,” she yelled. She was, however, hooked. The next year, she finished the race in 2:27:33, beating her record by almost five minutes and becoming the first woman to officially run a marathon faster than two and a half hours. Her legendary status was assured. In her home country, her New York victories conferred on her the status of a national hero; a statue of her stands outside Bislett Stadium, an international sports arena in Oslo, and her likeness appeared on a Norwegian postage stamp. She established a 5-kilometer race in Oslo that eventually expanded to 40,000 runners, and in 2007, she started her foundation, which sponsors runners in major races and supports cancer hospitals and patient centers.

What is the answer: What is the name of the Irish whiskey illicitly made from barley?","completion":"The name of the Irish whiskey illicitly made from barley is \\"Poitín\\" (pronounced as \\"potcheen\\" or \\"poteen\\"). Poitín has a long, rich history deeply rooted in Irish tradition and culture. Dating back to the 6th century, Poitín is one of the oldest distilled beverages in the world, often regarded as the predecessor of modern Irish whiskey. Its name is derived from the Irish word \\"pota,\\" which means \\"pot.\\" This is a reference to the small copper pot stills that were historically used in the distillation process. Poitín was typically produced in rural homes and hidden away in remote areas to evade the watchful eye of the British authorities who sought to control and heavily tax the production and sale of whiskey in Ireland. The primary ingredient for Poitín is malted barley, but it can also be made using other grains, sugar beets, or potatoes. The fermentation process uses a mixture of these ingredients along with water and yeast. After several days of fermentation, the liquid, known as \\"wash,\\" is ready for distillation. The wash is heated until it reaches the boiling point of ethanol, allowing the vapor to be collected and condensed back into liquid form. This process is often repeated multiple times to increase the alcohol concentration. Despite its illicit nature, Poitín became a fundamental part of Irish culture and society. It was often used to mark special occasions like weddings, funerals, and harvest celebrations and played a significant role in the bonding of communities. Poitín was also used for medicinal purposes and as a form of currency in economic transactions. The Irish government criminalized the production of Poitín in 1661, marking the beginning of its association with the term illicit. However, this ban did little to quash its production or its popularity. Covert distillers, known as \\"moonshiners,\\" continued to produce Poitín in well-hidden locations in the Irish countryside, using traditional recipes that have been passed down through generations. In the late 20th century, the Irish government began to acknowledge the historical and cultural importance of Poitín, and in 1997, it was granted a Geographical Indicative Status by the European Union. This means that Poitín is now recognized as a product unique to Ireland, much like Champagne is to France. In the same year, a legal version of Poitín was launched, the production of which adheres to strict guidelines set by the Irish government. Today, multiple brands produce legal Poitín, which can be found in a variety of establishments, both in Ireland and across the globe. However, the illicit and mystical charm of traditional Poitín continues to capture the imagination of many, and its clandestine production remains a strong representation of Ireland's enduring spirit and resilience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: An aspiring juggler is learning to juggle pins. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, we can infer a potential connection with the hypothesis, though more information may be needed to confirm it conclusively. Here is a detailed explanation: Premise: A man wearing a hat with blond dreadlocks holds juggling pins under a blue sky. In the premise, we are given the following pieces of information: 1. The man's appearance: He is wearing a hat and has blond dreadlocks. 2. The man's belongings: He is holding juggling pins. 3. The setting: It occurs under a blue sky. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: Hypothesis: An aspiring juggler is learning to juggle pins. The hypothesis offers more contextual information: 1. The man's goal or profession: He is an aspiring juggler, possibly looking to gain skill or experience in juggling. 2. The activity being undertaken: The man is learning to juggle using pins, which are a common object to juggle. The premise and the hypothesis are correlated through the mention of juggling pins. However, the distinction lies in their wording, in which the premise suggests that the man is merely holding the pins, while the hypothesis goes a step further and states that he is learning to juggle them. Although the presence of juggling pins implies that the man might be an aspiring juggler or at least interested in juggling, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise alone. Additional information, such as observing the man actually practicing juggling or the man's own confirmation of his aspirations, would be needed to confirm the hypothesis definitively. In summary, while there is a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entirely true based on the premise.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which was smaller, households with one or more children under 18 or households with someone over 65?","completion":"Title: Comparing Households: One or More Children Under 18 vs. Households with Someone Over 65 Introduction At the crossroads of demography and family life, an essential aspect of understanding the dynamics of society lies in the composition of households. In this article, we will examine and compare two types of households in terms of size - those with one or more children under 18, and those with someone over 65. The comparison will provide insights into the living arrangements and socio-economic trends of different age groups. Statistical Data Overview Before diving into the analysis, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of household composition. Households can be defined as a group of individuals residing together under one roof, sharing fundamental resources such as food, housing, and financial assets. Historically, households have evolved from large, extended families to smaller units, usually containing a nuclear family with two adults and a few children. More recently, households have diversified even further, encompassing various living arrangements, such as single-parent families, cohabiting couples, and adult children living with parents. Households with One or More Children Under 18 Families with children form a significant part of the population in most countries. In the United States, according to the 2019 American Community Survey, the number of such households amounted to approximately 33.3 million. These households typically include married couples with children, single-parent families, and cohabiting couples. Households with children often reflect the dynamics of childcare, education, and other social services. Additionally, they are vital in identifying trends in family size, childbirth, and child-rearing practices. Households with Someone Over 65 With the increasing global longevity and aging population, households with seniors over 65 years of age have become increasingly common. In the United States alone, the number of households with someone over 65 was over 31.4 million in 2019, as per the American Community Survey. Such households include seniors living independently, with a spouse or partner, or with other family members or caregivers. Notably, this type of household carries considerable importance when considering healthcare services, social security expenditures, geriatric facilities, and retirement policies. Comparing Household Sizes Having laid out the statistical background, we can now compare the sizes of households with one or more children under 18 and households with someone over 65. Given that there were approximately 33.3 million households with children under 18 and 31.4 million households with someone over 65 in the United States in 2019, households with one or more children under 18 appear more common. This prevalence of households with children under 18 may be influenced by several factors. First, these families reflect the past few decades' birth rates that increased the overall population growth. Moreover, cultural norms, such as marriage and having children, still play a significant role in family formation and sustainability. Finally, there has been a noticeable trend of adult children residing with their parents longer due to economic factors, further adding to this cohort's number. On the other hand, a relatively smaller number of households with someone over 65 can be attributed to the later stages of life, often accompanied by a decrease in life expectancy and an increase in the mortality rate among seniors. However, these numbers have been growing steadily as the global population sees a rise in the overall aging population. As such, the number of households with someone over 65 is expected to increase in the coming years. Conclusion In conclusion, households with one or more children under 18 are more common than households with someone over 65 in terms of size. This difference is attributed to the dynamics of population growth, family formation, and social and economic factors. As the population continues to age and family structures evolve further, it is crucial to understand and cater to the diverse needs and living arrangements of different households. By doing so, we can ensure a more sustainable, inclusive, and efficient provisioning of services and resources for all members of society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Last week, we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days, at least. Now, here we are again, an entire Wednesday later, prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead. So, wipe the Cheeto dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body-shaped imprint you've made on your bed. Your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably won't be short -- on average, unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks, a number that hasn't changed much in the last six months. But of course, you should aim to make it as brief as possible. \\"The longer you're laid off, the harder it is to get back in the market,\\" says Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's connection director. Act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit-chat over a box of donuts (with other people, that is). One positive note: The whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think (\\"funemployment,\\" anyone?). Last year, an Australian study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs. Maybe this'll be the best thing that ever happened to you. (Cheerleader jump! Cheerleader jump! Rah! Rah!) Read on for a few social network to-dos to get you back in the rat race. Target your pleas. Last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status (in short: Be brief, be upbeat, and only tell those who could specifically help you). A similar principle is at play as you're seeking out potential business contacts to bug. \\"A mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note,\\" Williams says. A better approach: Figure out something (or someone) you have in common with the individual, and send a personalized note along with your Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn request. \\"You have to get them to be interested in your situation,\\" she adds, \\"because people are busy, and why should they worry about your career?\\" Stalk potential employers. Not literally, of course. But when job-searching online, most people tend to think about job boards such as Monster.com and Craigslist.com. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings (and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites), massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with \\"duster-duck\\" -- meaning they're disorganized, crowded and teeming with humanity. Sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision, when corporate policy requires it. Months-old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they've been filled. And in the journalism world, for example, a listing on industry tracker MediaBistro.com can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications. Go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators, but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime. Brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you, and figure out how you can keep dibs on them. \\"That way you'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they're doing industry-wise,\\" Williams says. If the company's striking out on a new project that matches your skills, you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher-up over there, for example. And if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for Company X, you can swoop in. Poke around their website for an RSS feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader (such as Google Reader) for easy stalk-age. Follow the company on LinkedIn (go to the company tab along the top, search, and follow) to see who's leaving (and who will, presumably, leave behind a vacancy), and what current employees are in your circle -- they're your goldmines in the \\"Whom do I address this cover letter to?\\" game. Downplay the layoff in your job apps. Here's the thing: If you're the right candidate, then you're the right candidate -- whether you're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job-searching. While there's no shame in having been let go (at this point, we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy), your cover letter should shimmer with hireability, not with the grayish Braille of woe-is-me teardrops. Think of it this way: If you come across as defensive, insecure or bitter about the layoff, you'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager's mind. But if you're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas (and, oh yeah, it comes up in the interview that you're looking for a new job because you don't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and, hey, here's a recommendation letter from your former boss), you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet. And in this earthquake of an economy, a little catlike agility is a very good thing. Highlights:","completion":"1.

He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835.

Native Hawaiians (Hawaiian: \\"kānaka ʻōiwi\\", \\"kānaka maoli\\", and \\"Hawaiʻi maoli\\") are the indigenous Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands or their descendants. Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report for 2000, there are 401,000 people who identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 141,000 people identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone. The majority of Native Hawaiians reside in the state of Hawaii (two-thirds), and the rest are scattered among other states, especially in the American Southwest, and with a high concentration in California. The history of Native Hawaiians, like the history of Hawaii, is commonly classified into four major periods: One hypothesis is that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawaii in the 4th century from the Marquesas, and were followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who then conquered the original inhabitants. Another is that a single, extended period of settlement populated the islands. Evidence for a Tahitian conquest of the islands include the legends of Hawaiiloa and the navigator-priest Paao, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of \\"Kahiki\\" (Tahiti) and introduced many customs.

Hampshire (, ; abbreviated Hants) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. It is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. Hampshire is the largest county in South East England and remains the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county in all contemporary boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1890, Hampshire was the fifth-largest county in England. It now has an overall area of , and measures about east–west and north–south. Hampshire's tourist attractions include many seaside resorts and two national parks: the New Forest and the South Downs (together covering some 45% of the county).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How can I repair a corrupt file? How can I repair a corrupted file?","completion":"Yes, these two questions have the same meaning as they both refer to the process of fixing a file that has been damaged or altered in a way that affects its usability. In both questions, \\"corrupt\\" and \\"corrupted\\" imply that the file's original content has been compromised and cannot be accessed normally. The goal of the user likely is to restore the file (if possible) so that it can be used again. To provide a detailed answer to this question, let's look at various steps you can take to repair a corrupt or corrupted file: 1. Identify the file type: Before attempting to repair the file, it's essential to know its type, such as a text document, image file, or video file. Each file type may require a different method to fix corruption. 2. Use backup copies: If you have a backup of the file which was created before the corruption occurred, you can simply replace the corrupt file with the backup version. 3. Repair via built-in tools: Some software applications, such as Microsoft Office, have built-in features that can help diagnose and repair corrupted files. Look for the 'Open and Repair' or similar options in the application's menu. 4. Use third-party repair tools: There are many specialized tools available for different file types (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, JPEG, etc.). These tools can be either free or paid and can be found with a simple Google search. Some examples include Stellar Repair for Word, Kernel for Excel, and SysInfoTools PDF Repair. 5. Convert the file: You can try converting the file to another format or an updated version. For example, if you have a corrupted Word document, you can try converting it to a different format like RTF (Rich Text Format) or opening it in another Word-compatible software such as Google Docs, and then save it back in the original format. 6. Open file in a different software: Sometimes, corrupt files can still be accessed with other software programs that are similar in function. For example, if you have a damaged video file, you can try opening it in a different media player like VLC Media Player. 7. Use a hexadecimal editor: Hexadecimal editors, also known as hex editors, can be used to examine and modify the binary data of a file manually. However, using a hex editor requires advanced knowledge of file formats and is not recommended for inexperienced users. 8. Seek professional help: If the file holds critical information, consider hiring a data recovery professional to repair the file. Although this may be more expensive, professionals have more extensive experience, knowledge, and tools to retrieve and repair corrupt files. Please note that the success of repairing a corrupt or corrupted file depends on the severity of the damage, and in some instances, it may not be possible to recover or repair the file. In such cases, it's crucial to learn from the experience and implement a reliable data backup and protection strategy to minimize the risk of data loss in the future. Regularly backing up important files, using antivirus software, and safely disconnecting storage devices will help prevent file corruption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jan wanted to move a desk into the corner of the family room but the","completion":"desk was extremely heavy, so she enlisted the help of her friend, Mark, to carefully maneuver it into place. The decision to move the desk was not one taken lightly by Jan, as she knew it would require considerable effort due to the sheer weight and size of the desk. It was an old and antique piece, which had been in the family for generations and held significant sentimental value. She wanted to create a more functional workspace for herself and her children, and moving the desk to the corner of the family room seemed like the perfect solution. In preparation for the move, Jan cleared a path within the room to make it as easy as possible for her and Mark to relocate the desk. She removed any unnecessary obstacles, ensuring a straight path to the designated corner. Additionally, Jan placed several thick blankets on the floor to protect both the desk and the hardwood floor from potential damage during the moving process. Once Mark arrived, both Jan and Mark put on gloves to protect their hands and proceeded to inspect the desk for the best points where they could exert force without risking injury or damage to the desk. Finding the most suitable points on the sides of the desk, they each bent their knees and kept their backs straight while lifting it off the ground. Jan and Mark communicated throughout the entire process, making sure to move in unison and in a slow, controlled manner. Their careful approach paid off, as they successfully avoided any scratches, dents, or other damages to the desk or floor. After reaching the designated corner, both Jan and Mark gently lowered the desk into its new spot. They took a moment to appreciate their hard work and shared a sense of camaraderie from having accomplished this challenging task together. Jan then spent some time arranging her office supplies on the desk’s smooth surface, feeling a sense of satisfaction and motivation with her newly reorganized workspace. Once everything was neatly arranged and in place, Jan thanked Mark for his help and they shared a well-deserved break, enjoying a cup of coffee together as they marveled at how the desk looked in its newly appointed corner. Jan knew she couldn't have moved the desk without Mark's help, and she was grateful for his friendship and willingness to lend a hand. In conclusion, with the help of her friend Mark, Jan was able to successfully move the desk into the corner of the family room. The newly reorganized workspace not only served as a functional area for Jan and her children, but also preserved the sentimental value of the antique desk while breathing new life into the family room. The experience, though challenging, ultimately strengthened the bond between Jan and Mark and reminded them of the importance of teamwork and friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This type of organizational system is best for people who tend to categorize events chronologically in their minds, though it really just boils down to a matter of preference. To organize your personnel files chronologically, you’ll create a separate file for each employee. Within that employee file, you will include all of the pertinent documents in chronological order. For example, one employee’s file might begin with a completed job application, résumé/CV, and W-4, then add newer documents behind – like annual performance evaluations. This type of organizational system is best for people who tend to look at the bigger picture more, though personal preference is the main determining factor. For this type of organization, you’ll need to group files by document type, keeping all similar files together for every employee. For example, you could have one file that contains all of the employee drug tests, another one for all employee performance evaluations, and yet another for necessary medical records. Within each document type grouping, you should organize the files alphabetically to make it easier to find each employee’s forms as needed. Most governments have laws in place related to what documents a company is required to keep for each employee. Make sure you check with local and national laws to ensure that you’re maintaining your personnel files according to their requirements. Your personnel files should include all information related to the hiring/application process and the relationship between the employee and the company. This includes documents related to performance evaluations, employee commendations, and even disciplinary measures taken. Most laws require businesses to maintain documentation (even after an employee has been terminated) for at least 3 years, though it’s recommended to keep them for a minimum of 5 years to cover your bases in case an unforeseen issue arises. While it’s important to organize and maintain your original documents, it’s also a good idea to make electronic copies of those documents. This could come in handy in case anything happens to the hard copies – lost, damaged, destroyed, etc. Remember to continuously back up your electronic copies to make sure your safety net is up-to-date.

Wall is believed to have been built by Canaanites.","completion":"Title: Unearthing a 3,700-year-old Architectural Marvel: The Mysterious Canaanite Wall Introduction A team of archaeologists have recently uncovered a massive and ancient wall thought to have been constructed around 3,700 years ago. The wall, which is made of boulders weighing between 4 to 5 tons each, stands at a staggering height of 26 feet. This architectural marvel not only highlights the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the ancient people who built it, but also elicits deep-seated questions about the techniques and tools they may have employed. A Herculean Task One of the most striking aspects of the wall's construction is the sheer size and weight of the boulders used to build it. According to the archaeologists, each individual boulder weighs between 4 to 5 tons. Such a feat leaves both experts and laypeople alike to wonder how the ancient inhabitants of the region were able to transport and assemble these colossal stones. As one of the archaeologists on the project put it best, \\"I don't know how to do it today without mechanical equipment.\\" The wall's existence is a testament to its builders' determination, patience, and creativity. Defensive Architecture The wall appears to have been strategically positioned to defend a path leading to a spring. The architects behind this monumental feat were probably well aware of the importance of securing access to essential resources, such as water. Springs were crucial for supporting human civilization, and by creating a defensive barrier, the wall efﬁciently protected this vital resource while guaranteeing control over it. A Canaanite Edifice The wall is believed to have been built by the Canaanites, a group of people who resided in the area of modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Syria and Jordan during this period. The Canaanites were home to a diverse range of cultures and backgrounds, and many biblical historians link them to some of the oldest accounts mentioned in the Bible. This ﬁnding, therefore, serves as a window into the lives and capabilities of an ancient and enigmatic society. Implications and Future Research The discovery of this 3,700-year-old Canaanite wall presents a unique opportunity for historians, archaeologists, and researchers in the ﬁeld of ancient architecture. The incredible ingenuity required to build such a structure using rudimentary tools and methods provides insight into the skills and techniques of the people. In addition, the defensive purpose of the wall sheds light on the social and political climate of the time, revealing important information about the priorities and concerns of those who resided in the region. Continued studies of the wall, as well as similar ancient structures, can broaden our understanding of the development of technology, architecture, and societal organization across various epochs of human history. Conclusion The wall, constructed from massive 4 to 5-ton boulders and reaching a height of 26 feet, stands as a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Canaanites and their advanced architectural prowess. The defensive nature of the wall highlights the importance of securing valuable resources, such as water, while also giving us a glimpse into their society and culture 3,700 years ago. As research and exploration continue, this fascinating discovery will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into the lives and capabilities of those who came before us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: As discussed earlier, sit in team formation and designate a dealer. Grab your Euchre deck and have the dealer give each player 5 cards and assemble the kitty. Starting to the person left of the dealer, rotating clockwise, ask each player whether or not he wishes to declare the suit that is showing as trump until someone does (or a new cycle begins). If he does wish to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pick it up.\\" If he does not want to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pass,\\" or declares a pass by knocking on the table. He/She then discards one of their other cards (usually a low card of the non-trump suit). If a rotation of the circle is completed without anyone telling the dealer to \\"pick it up,\\" the card is turned face down and another rotation ensues. During this rotation, a player can call trump of any suit other than the one that was originally turned up. If the rotation completes without anyone calling trump, the deal is forfeited and passed clockwise to the next person in the circle. It's generally wise to only call a trump suit if you have a good hand. Otherwise, stay mum. Each player must follow suit -- meaning if a player has a card of the same suit as was led, he must play it on that trick. If a player does not have a card of that suit, he can trump the trick, or simply throw a card off suit. The highest card of the suit that was led takes the trick, unless a trump card is played. The highest card of trump will win any hand. If you lay a card that does not follow suit but you do have a card that does, this is called a \\"renege.\\" If another player calls you out on what you've done, they receive 2 points. If you are going alone, however, the penalty is 4 points (for whichever side is guilty). Because each game of Euchre is so short, it's a little easier to memorize the cards. Think about what cards you believe your opponents are holding to determine how to lead off and what to throw away. For example, if the dealer adds the original trump card to his hand, don't forget it. If you are leading and have two or more trump cards, go with those. Always lead a high trump if your partner called it; it'll help them locate the missing cards. Otherwise, work in a sequence. Say diamonds are trump -- lead with the Ace of Spades or Clubs to try to win it. Don't hold onto your good cards. Euchre goes fast -- if you act slowly, you'll miss your opportunity to use them. When opportunity knocks, answer the door. \\" Once one team gets to 9 points, this means they are \\"in the barn.\\" You must announce this with great enthusiasm, since it typically indicates that you are about to win the game. If you really want to have fun with it, have one partner interlock their fingers together, and flip upside down with the thumbs making \\"udders\\" and let the other partner \\"milk\\" them. The five tricks of Euchre can go by pretty fast, so it's best to keep score as you go. Use the 6 and 4 cards to keep tabs. Once a team reaches ten, you'll probably want to play again. Switch teams if skill sets are better suited in different combinations. Summary:","completion":"This article explains the rules of the card game Euchre: players sit in teams and a dealer is designated, who gives each player five cards and assembles the kitty. The players declare the trump suit in clockwise order, starting from the dealer's left. If no one declares a trump suit after a full rotation, the dealer flips the top card face down and another rotation begins. Players must follow suit when playing a card, but if they don't have a matching card, they can use a trump card or play off-suit. The highest card of the trump suit or the led suit wins the trick. Reneging is penalized with points deductions. In Euchre, card memorization is essential. Leading with multiple trump cards is a good strategy and leading a high trump when your partner called it is helpful in locating missing cards. Since Euchre is quick-paced, acting fast and using your good cards is vital. Teams announce when they reach nine points (also known as \\"in the barn\\"), and the game continues until a team reaches ten points. Scorekeeping is important, and switching teams for better skill sets is recommended for subsequent games."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first provide definitions of the key terms and then compare and contrast them. 1. Irony: Irony refers to a situation, event, or outcome in which there is a significant difference or disconnect between what is expected and what actually happens. It is often used in literature, speech, or humor to create a surprising or interesting effect. 2. Contradiction: A contradiction occurs when two or more statements are opposed to one another, making it impossible for both to be simultaneously true. It can happen in logical statements, arguments, or claims. 3. Paradox: A paradox is a statement or situation that seems to be self-contradictory or absurd, yet may contain a hidden truth or valid reasoning. Paradoxes often challenge our understanding of logic or force us to think more deeply about a subject. Now, I will answer each question. Question 1: The difference between irony, contradiction, and paradox lies in their nature. Irony pertains to the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes, while contradiction involves the opposition of two statements or claims. Finally, a paradox is a seemingly self-contradictory or absurd statement that may have an underlying truth. Question 2: A paradox contains statements or elements that seem to contradict each other but might reveal a hidden truth upon closer examination. It provokes thought and often offers a new perspective on a topic. Conversely, a logical contradiction shows the clear opposition of two statements or premises in a logical argument, which makes the overall argument invalid. Comparison of questions 1 and 2: Although there is some overlap in the subject matter of both questions, they are not the same question. Question 1 addresses differences among irony, contradiction, and paradox due to their nature, while Question 2 focuses on the specific difference between paradox and logical contradiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The stirring action heated the spoon: While stirring might produce some friction, it's not enough to heat the spoon significantly. 2. Warm air in the room heated the spoon: This is also not likely, as the air in the room would not be hot enough to make the spoon very warm without causing discomfort to the student. 3. Heat from the soup was transferred to the spoon: This option seems the most plausible, as the soup was heated on the stove, making it hot. When the metal spoon was immersed in the hot soup, the heat from the soup transferred to the spoon due to the metal's conductivity. 4. The student's hand transferred heat to the spoon: The student's hand would not be warm enough to heat the metal spoon significantly; the hand would also quickly feel uncomfortable if it were to transfer that much heat. Based on this analysis, the most likely reason for the metal spoon becoming warm is that the heat from the soup was transferred to the spoon.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

Context: The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration. Question: How many years did the Russo-Turkish war last? Answer:","completion":"The Russo-Turkish War lasted for approximately one year. It began in 1877 and ended in 1878. The war was ignited by the rising tension between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire and was primarily a result of conflict of interest in the Balkans region. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano and later the Treaty of Berlin, which led significant territorial losses for the Ottoman Empire and gains for Russia. However, the territories gained by Russia during this war became a central point of conflict in the Georgian-Armenian War of 1918, as discussed in the context above. The territories were returned to the Ottoman Empire as per the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed by Russia in March 1918. This further led to the dissolution of the Transcaucasian collective and the declaration of independence by Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Subsequent treaties and military actions led to complex territorial control dynamics between these new nation states and the withdrawing Ottoman Empire, culminating in the short border conflict between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy).

Part of a standing popularity is among accountants, programmers, telemarketers and other office workers across the nation. GeekDesk, a California firm that sells desks raised by electric motors, says sales will triple this year. Standers give various reasons for taking to their feet: It makes them feel more focused, prevents drowsiness , and makes them feel like a general even if they just push paper. (Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfels works standing up. So does novelist Philip Roth.) But unknown to them, a debate is spreading among ergonomics experts and public-health researchers about whether all office workers should be encouraged to stand--to save lives. Doctors point to surprising new research showing higher rates of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even mortality among people who sit for long stretches. A study earlier this year in theAmerican Journal of Epidemiologyshowed that among 123,000 adults followed over 14 years, those who sat more than six hours a day were at least 18 percent more likely to die during the time period studied than those who sat less than three hours a day. \\"Every rock we turn over when it comes to sitting is astonishing,\\" said Marc Hamilton, a leading researcher on inactivity physiology at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. \\"Sitting is harmful.

Here is a question: What are geckos ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to this question, \\"What are Geckos?\\" would be a description. Geckos are a diverse and widespread group of small to medium-sized reptiles belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, within the larger order Squamata, which also includes snakes and other lizards. There are more than 1,500 known species of geckos found across various regions worldwide, including Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Typically, geckos inhabit warm climates and can be found in numerous ecosystems, such as deserts, rainforests, grasslands, and even urban environments. Geckos are characterized by several unique features. Their most famous trait is their outstanding ability to climb and adhere to various surfaces, including smooth, vertical or overhanging ones. This ability is facilitated by specialized adhesive toe pads consisting of millions of hairs (called setae) which interact with surfaces at the molecular level, utilizing van der Waals forces. This enables geckos to effectively stick to a wide range of materials without the need for sticky secretions or suction cups. Most gecko species are nocturnal, meaning they are active primarily during the night. They have large eyes with vertically elliptical pupils, which can dilate widely, allowing them to capture as much light as possible in low-light conditions. Geckos also possess excellent vision, which helps them locate food and detect potential threats. Geckos exhibit various patterns of coloration and markings, ranging from vivid hues to dull shades, often allowing them to blend with their environment. These colors and patterns can also change based on their mood, temperature, or stress levels. In certain gecko species, these changes can be quite dramatic. Geckos are predominantly insectivorous, feeding on a diet mainly comprising insects and other small invertebrates. Some species, however, are known to consume fruits and nectar as well. Geckos have unique feeding behavior where they use their long, sticky tongues to catch their prey. Geckos reproduce through laying eggs, and many gecko species are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs that hatch outside the mother's body. Some species, however, exhibit ovoviviparous reproduction, where embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. These fascinating creatures have cultural significance in various parts of the world, often symbolizing good luck and prosperity. They also hold scientific interest due to their unique features, such as their adhesive abilities and capacity for regeneration, inspiring innovations in areas like materials science and biomedical research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Occasionally honorary appointees are, incorrectly, referred to as Sir or Dame - Bill Gates or Bob Geldof, for example. Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive, then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order including use of the title of Sir and Dame for the senior two ranks of the Order.

They both state essentially the same thing: the National Railway Company of Belgium, historically, was responsible for managing rail transport in the country. Additionally, both sentences clarify the acronym of the company in both French and Dutch languages, which is NMBS and SNCB respectively. The use of paraphrasing allows for the expression of the same idea in slightly different ways, with somewhat different grammar or structure while retaining the original meaning.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The full scale of spending on private contractors by the UK’s biggest police force is laid bare today as the nation’s most senior officer is summoned by MPs to account for millions of pounds in wasted public money. A leaked list seen by The Mail on Sunday shows the Metropolitan Police has signed deals worth £3.5 billion with more than 300 companies, to supply everything from high-tech weaponry to sandwiches. The huge sums will be scrutinised when Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe appears before a powerful group of MPs on Tuesday, with Scotland Yard under pressure to save more than £500 million without losing officers from the streets. Mounting costs: The Metropolitan Police have been criticised for their spending including £500,00 going on cleaning up horse manure. Full details of the Met’s spending with private firms, spanning more than a decade and with some contracts ongoing, reveal the force is paying out:. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is the first time that we have received such a comprehensive list about the expenditure of a police force. We will be exploring some of the expenditure with the Commissioner when he appears before the Committee on Tuesday.’ Joanne McCartney, chairwoman of the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘I think procurement at the Met does need to be looked at. We have raised issues with the Met’s spending on dog kennelling before. Its IT costs have been looked at before. ‘I think the budget needs to be tightened, otherwise it will mean fewer police officers being employed.’Jenny Jones, the deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘Police officers tell me they see waste all the time at the Met. Aiming high: The force spent £21.1million on weapons and armour. They tell me it costs the Met £100 just to put a whiteboard up in their office. The police officers say they get angry because it means bobbies on the beat are cut back. There is waste at every level of the organisation.’ With national responsibility for counterterrorism and protecting VIPs as well as keeping Londoners safe, the Met currently has 31,548 officers, a further 2,738 police community support officers and another 20,000 civilian staff. Like other forces, it must cope with 20 per cent cuts to main Home Office funding, but the Met is yet to finalise how it will make savings totalling £548 million by 2015-16. The Met is behind schedule after the phone-hacking scandal led to the departure of three senior figures, including the Commissioner, while much of the past year was spent preparing for the Olympics. However, although salaries account for a large proportion of bills, the Met cannot easily lose officers after London Mayor Boris Johnson made an election vow to protect police numbers. Frying squad: £920,000 went on 'bread and morning products' His Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Stephen Greenhalgh, has said that only about 500 posts will be cut and has promised to ‘sweat’ the assets and introduce ‘smarter procurement’ at an organisation he described as an ‘enormous beast’. Mr Greenhalgh told the Home Affairs Select Committee in September that he was ‘staggered’ by how much the force spends on IT. It also employs 802 in-house computer maintenance staff because counterterrorism officers are worried about the security risks of using outside external contractors. Mr Greenhalgh said the Met did not need a ‘plethora of expensive buildings’ and spent a ‘staggering’ £200 million on running them. Last month, the force announced plans to sell its New Scotland Yard headquarters, famous for its revolving sign, in an attempt to save money. The reassuring presence of police stations across London is also under threat, with proposals to replace them with counters inside supermarkets and cafes. The full list of the Met’s 319 contracts with private companies, some dating back as far as 2003, suggest many more areas where the axe is likely to fall. According to the document, the total value of the listed deals is £3.5 billion. A third of this has gone on IT alone. The money spent on food and drink to be sold in canteens includes £920,000 on ‘bread and morning products’ and £148,000 on fruit squash. The outlay on weapons and armour included £3.2 million on Tasers, £7,000 on ‘grenade boxes’, £641,000 on ammunition for sniper rifles and £400,000 on Heckler & Koch pistols. A Met spokesman refused to say what its Recon Scout robots were used for on ‘security grounds’. The document also shows the force has spent more than £40,000 on storing evidence relating to their investigation into the death of Mr Litvinenko, who detectives say was killed with the poison polonium-210 in 2006. Fire power: The outlay on weapons and armour included £3.2 million on. Tasers (pictured), £7,000 on 'grenade boxes', £641,000 on ammunition for. sniper rifles and £400,000 on Heckler & Koch pistols. Among £13.7 million-worth of vehicles bought were a Volkswagen Caravelle people carrier, 18 Ford Transit vans, mountain bikes, multi-vehicle transporters and six Jaguars. A Scotland Yard spokesman could not explain why it leased five electric cars for £64,000. In total, £10.9 million was spent on caring for animals – both those used by the force and those seized from the public. This included a £500,000-a-year deal with Balfour Beatty to remove manure from horse stables and dispose of it, and £1.3 million on ‘forage/bedding’. A further £22.6 million was spent on clothing, ranging from £151,876 for ‘embroidered inspector epaulettes’ to £46,134 on riot police balaclavas. Major contracts included £280 million to clean and maintain police buildings, £107 million to provide concessionary travel for officers and £220 million to repair the Met’s fleet of vehicles. Millions of pounds were also spent on fees for doctors who check on the health of suspects in custody. More unusual items of spending included £62,000 to improve oil storage at a bothy near Balmoral, £600,000 for ‘conflict management services’ and £358,696 to build a ‘temporary armoury’ in an ‘underground car park’. A spokesman for the Met declined to comment on individual contracts. He insisted: ‘The Met gets best value for money through stringent procurement processes.’ A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘The Mayor’s Office has put tough new processes in place to monitor spending, cut out waste and ensure more money goes towards frontline policing.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article highlights the Metropolitan Police's expenditure on private contractors, which totals £3.5 billion with more than 300 companies, for various services and supplies ranging from high-tech weaponry to sandwiches.

Write a title for this article: Wednesday, February 23rd 2011, 4:00 AM TAMPA - Don't think for a second that Hank Steinbrenner didn't intend to jab Derek Jeter with his line on Monday about \\"players building mansions,\\" no matter how much the Yankee owner was back-pedaling Tuesday. This is a page right out of the old George Steinbrenner playbook, and Hank suddenly seems to have decided to take up for the late Boss when it comes to calling out star players. Essentially Hank was reminding Jeter that the Yankees agreed this winter to pay him a lot more money than they think he is worth, so he better go out and earn it. And while Jeter, whose Tampa-area mansion has attracted much attention locally, laughed it off Tuesday, he has to know this only further heightens the scrutiny on him this season as he tries to bounce back from hitting .270 and prove his career is not in significant decline. Put it this way: If the captain gets off to a slow start, his countdown to 3,000 hits this season may not be so warm and fuzzy. As it is, the onus is likely to be on the Yankee lineup to make up for a lack of dominant starting pitching in 2011, which means Jeter needs to hit and be on base for the thumpers in the middle of the lineup. His history is that he responds in a big way to criticism. When The Boss himself got on Jeter for his nightlife activities before the 2003 season - remember the subsequent Visa conga-line commercial? - the shortstop hit .324 and helped lead the Yanks back to the World Series. Of course, he turned 29 that year, and he'll turn 37 this year. All of which makes for some fascinating intrigue, especially now that Hank has escaped the dungeon in which he had apparently been locked for a couple of years. He's not George, to be sure. George wouldn't have backed off his obvious knock on Jeter so quickly, as Hank did Tuesday, saying, \\"You don't win five rings by being complacent. So it was definitely not Derek I was talking about.\\" From everything you see and hear about Hank, he doesn't have George's bully side. So while he made his point about Jeter one day, he seemed concerned the next about bruising his shortstop's feelings. Still, Hank did stick to his theme, hammering the Yankees as a whole for not being hungry enough last year. Obviously such a theme would carry more weight if the club had missed the playoffs, rather than reaching the ALCS, but then, as we've come to learn, when Hank shoots from the hip, his comments are more scattershot than measured. Indeed, Bud Selig has already reacted to Hank's ranting about revenue-sharing, calling brother Hal Tuesday to remind him of the gag order the commissioner has placed on the subject.

Article: The Communist Party of Germany featured similar attitudes. In Die Welt, a communist newspaper published in Stockholm[e] the exiled communist leader Walter Ulbricht opposed the allies (Britain representing \\"the most reactionary force in the world\\") and argued: \\"The German government declared itself ready for friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the English–French war bloc desires a war against the socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the working people of Germany have an interest in preventing the English war plan.\\" Question: The British army was considered to be what by Walter Ulbricbht?","completion":"Walter Ulbricht, the exiled communist leader of Germany, regarded the British army as part of \\"the most reactionary force in the world.\\" In his statement published in Die Welt, a communist newspaper in Stockholm, Ulbricht expressed his opposition to the allies, represented by Britain and France. Ulbricht's view of the British army, as well as Britain and its allies, was rooted in the historical, political, and ideological context of the time. During the era in which Ulbricht was active, the world was divided by conflicting ideologies – primarily between communism and capitalism. Ulbricht, as a devoted communist, saw the capitalist, imperialist nations, like Britain and France, as enemies of the socialist cause and working-class people. For Ulbricht, the British and French war alliance posed a significant threat to the Soviet Union, which was the major power representing and championing socialism and communism at the time. He believed that the British and their allies were actively seeking a war against the Soviet Union to weaken or even eliminate the power of socialism in the world. In contrast, the German government, at least in rhetoric, had declared its willingness to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, an approach that Ulbricht saw favorably, especially given his devotion to communism. Ulbricht's perspective on the British forces, therefore, was shaped by his ideological convictions and the geopolitical dynamics of the time. In his eyes, the British army, as part of \\"the most reactionary force in the world,\\" represented an obstacle to the advancement and consolidation of socialism on the global stage. He urged the Soviet people and working people of Germany to prevent the plans of the British and their allies, which he believed were aimed at starting a war against the Soviet Union, the bastion of socialism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The foreign currency got more expensive and they had problems with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks, but didn't have those problems. Which country had a more shadow market problems? Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]","completion":"Based on the information provided, it appears that Booneland experienced more significant shadow market problems compared to Bradland due to the changes in their foreign exchange controls. When Booneland altered their foreign exchange controls, the foreign currency became more expensive, leading to difficulties with a shadow currency exchange. Foreign exchange controls are policies that restrict or guide the flow of foreign currencies and investments in and out of a nation. These controls can have multiple purposes, such as protecting a country's financial stability, safeguarding the value of its currency, or giving the government more control over financial decisions and trade policies. However, these controls can also produce unintended consequences, such as the rise of shadow markets. In contrast to Booneland, Bradland did not change their foreign exchange controls, and the people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks. As a result, Bradland did not experience many problems associated with shadow currency exchanges. The hint provided suggests that foreign exchange controls can lead to the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies, which is likely what has happened in Booneland's case. In the shadow market, people may engage in illegal transactions by exchanging their weaker national currency for a stronger foreign currency at a significantly higher exchange rate than the one set by the government. This informal market can create distortions in the national economy and provide incentives for criminal activities, such as money laundering, tax evasion, and currency speculation. Furthermore, as the hint indicates, the effectiveness of exchange controls can be difficult to determine as they may not always achieve their intended purpose. In some cases, they might exacerbate the very problems they intended to solve, making it even harder to manage the flow of foreign currencies and investments. Booneland's experience serves as an example of how foreign exchange controls can lead to unintended consequences, such as the emergence of shadow markets. In conclusion, Booneland faced more shadow market problems due to the changes in their foreign exchange controls, which caused the foreign currency to become more expensive and resulted in difficulties with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland, on the other hand, did not experience such issues as they did not change their policies, and their citizens were more cautious and risk-averse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs. Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves. He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts. Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The next day, Ed arrives at the Baldwins' house in a modified World War II-era snowcat, explaining that he intends to take Michael and his family to North Pole City to prove that Santa Claus is real and reveal the damage that is being done.

A:","completion":"The Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) is a Soviet 14-cylinder, two-row, air-cooled radial aircraft engine that can trace its origins back to a series of engines leading back to an American engine. The development process involved successive modifications and improvements to existing engines to cater to various performance needs of the Soviet aviation industry. The ASh-82 was derived from the Shvetsov M-62 engine, which itself was the product of development efforts based on the Shvetsov M-25. Before delving further into the evolution of these engines, it is essential to understand the birth of the M-25 engine. The Shvetsov M-25 was a Soviet licensed version of the American Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine. This nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial aircraft engine was developed by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation in the 1930s. The Cyclone 9 was widely utilized in various aircraft, particularly in military applications, and played a significant role in propelling aviation technology during that era. In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union realized the need for advanced aircraft engines to bolster their military and aviation capabilities. They purchased a license to manufacture the Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine and began producing their own version, which was designated the Shvetsov M-25. This engine was an influential foundation for the later Soviet radial engines, as it was integrated into many aircraft types and continuously improved. As both the aviation capabilities and the performance requirements grew in the Soviet Union, the M-25 underwent multiple changes, upgrades, and developments. One key result of this ongoing process was the Shvetsov M-62. The M-62 was an enhanced version of the M-25, boasting more power and better performance characteristics. It featured increased displacement, a higher compression ratio, a new two-speed supercharger, and a higher overall output, making it suitable for larger and faster aircraft. However, the demands of the aviation industry did not stop there. The development of the Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) continued from the foundation set by the M-62. One of the most significant changes in this engine was the transformation from a single-row, nine-cylinder layout to a 14-cylinder, two-row configuration. This new design improved cooling efficiency and allowed for even higher power output. The ASh-82 went on to power numerous Soviet military aircraft, such as the Lavochkin La-5, La-7, and Tupolev Tu-2. In summary, the Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) Soviet radial aircraft engine had its roots in the American Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine. The Soviet Union acquired a license to produce their own version, the M-25, which formed the basis for the development of the M-62 and eventually the ASh-82. The series of engines showcase the continuous evolution and progression of aircraft engine technology as well as the Soviet Union's efforts to maintain a robust aviation industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. One day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of \\"frustration \\". They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat me. I will have to keep building my tunnels. Question: Which of the following is NOT the lesson from the ant farm? Options: A: The ants have the spirit of teamwork.

Summarize: If you can manage to grab a large object, such as a plank or a piece of rafter, you'll greatly increase your chances of survival. The object will absorb some of the impact when you land, taking a little stress off of your bones. If you're falling next to a building, or off a cliff in the wilderness, do your best to break your fall into segments by hitting a ledge, a lower cliff, a tree, or another object. This breaks up the momentum of your fall and divides it into several shorter falls, which gives you a much better chance of surviving. If your knees and elbows are locked and your muscles are rigid, the impact of the fall will do more harm to your vital organs. Don't hold yourself stiff. Do your best to relax your body so that when you hit the ground your body is more easily able to take the impact. One way to remain (relatively) calm is to focus on performing the steps that lead to greater survival rates. Stay aware of your body, moving your arms and legs to make sure they aren't locked. Possibly nothing is more important to surviving a fall (or simpler to do) than bending your knees. Research has shown that having one's knees bent at impact can reduce the magnitude of impact forces 36-fold. However, do not bend them too far - only keep a slight bend so they are not locked. No matter what height you fall from, you should always try to land on your feet. Landing feet-first concentrates the impact force on a small area, allowing your feet and legs to absorb the worst of the blow. If you are in any other position, try to right yourself before you hit the ground. Fortunately, attaining the feet-first position seems to be an instinctive reaction. Keep your feet and legs tightly together so that both your feet hit the ground at the same time. Land on the balls of your feet. Point your toes slightly down before impact so that you will land on the balls of your feet. This will allow your lower body to more effectively absorb the impact. Once you land on your feet, you will fall either to the side, front or back. Try to avoid falling on your back. Falling to the side is statistically best. If you can't manage that, try to fall forward instead, breaking your fall with your arms. When you fall from a great height onto land, you will usually bounce. Some people who survive the initial impact (often with a feet-first landing) suffer a fatal injury on their second impact. You will most likely be unconscious when you bounce. Cover your head with your arms by placing your arms on the sides of your head with your elbows facing forward (and projecting in front of your face), and your fingers laced behind your head or neck. This covers a large portion of your head. With all the adrenaline flowing in response to your flight, you may not even feel injured upon landing. Even if you are not visibly injured, you may have sustained fractures or internal injuries that must be treated immediately. No matter how you're feeling, get to a hospital as quickly as possible.","completion":"To increase one's chance of survival when falling from a great height, taking several steps can help absorb and distribute the impact forces effectively. Firstly, grabbing a large object like a plank or a piece of rafter can help absorb some of the landing impact, reducing stress on bones.

After landing feet-first, try falling to the side, which is statistically the best, or fall forward and use arms to break the fall.

James Michael \`\`Jimmy'' Anderson, OBE (born 30 July 1982) is an English cricketer who plays for Lancashire and England, in all forms of the game. Widely regarded as one of the game's greatest fast bowlers, he is known for his swing bowling, being able to swing the ball both ways and is adept at extracting late swing. Currently holding the record of most wickets for England in both ODI cricket and Test cricket, Anderson is the only English bowler, and the 6th overall, to pass 500 test wickets. is jimmy anderson the best bowler in the world?","completion":"While it is difficult to definitively say that Jimmy Anderson is the best bowler in the world, there is no denying his exceptional skill and numerous accomplishments that place him among the top bowlers globally. Various factors contribute to the overall assessment of a bowler's excellence, including personal statistics, impact on the team, consistency, and longevity. It is essential to recognize that opinions on the best bowler in the world are often subjective and influenced by personal biases and allegiances. A comprehensive look at Jimmy Anderson's career achievements and abilities can provide valuable context for evaluating his position among the best bowlers in the world. With over 600 Test wickets to his name, Anderson is the highest wicket-taker among fast bowlers in Test cricket history. This record is a clear testament to his mastery and consistency in the longest format of the game, making him an undeniable legend in Test cricket. Furthermore, Anderson's ability to generate considerable swing with the ball while maintaining exceptional control makes him a challenging adversary for batsmen. His prowess with both the new and the old ball and expertise in extracting late swing further solidify his status as a fearsome fast bowler. Another factor that highlights Anderson's greatness is his longevity in the sport. Fast bowling is physically demanding, and it is rare for a fast bowler to consistently perform at the highest level for an extended period. Anderson's ongoing career of nearly two decades at the top level speaks volumes about his dedication, fitness, and durability. Taking these factors into account, there is little doubt that Jimmy Anderson is one of the best bowlers in the world. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are other exceptional bowlers, like Dale Steyn, Glenn McGrath, and Wasim Akram who similarly have outstanding records and unique skill sets that make them strong contenders for the title. As cricket is a continuously evolving game with various formats and playing conditions, the best bowler in the world can be a matter of personal opinion or preference, depending on what factors one considers most significant. Nevertheless, Jimmy Anderson certainly ranks among the elite bowlers in the history of the game, and his enduring success has cemented his status as a true legend of cricket."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Open warfare broke out in 1352, when John V, supported by Venetian and Serbian troops, launched an attack on Matthew Kantakouzenos. John Kantakouzenos came to his son's aid with 10,000 Ottoman troops who retook the cities of Thrace, liberally plundering them in the process. In October 1352, at Demotika, the Ottoman force met and defeated 4,000 Serbs provided to John V by Dushan. This was the Ottomans' first victory in Europe and an ominous portent. Two years later their capture of Gallipoli marked the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, culminating a century later in the Fall of Constantinople. Meanwhile, John V fled to the island of Tenedos, from where he made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Constantinople in March 1353. John VI Kantakouzenos responded by having Matthew crowned as co-emperor, but John V Palaiologos, enlisting Genoese support and relying on the declining popularity of Kantakouzenos, succeeded in entering the capital in November 1354. John VI Kantakouzenos abdicated and retired to a monastery. Matthew held out in Thrace making war upon the Serbs in 1356. Then Matthew gathered an army of 5,000 Turks and marched on Serres the Serbian held capital of John Ugleisha.

Context: Canada's Armed forces operate out of 27 Canadian Forces bases (CFB) across the country, including NDHQ. This number has been gradually reduced since the 1970s with bases either being closed or merged. Both officers and non-commissioned members receive their basic training at the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.

I also learned many English songs and lots of interesting things about American culture. When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future. Carla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro I spent last year studying English in London. I'm from a small town, and London is a very big city. Sometimes I felt it was too big. There were so many people to talk to, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family, and I really missed my two cats. My roommate was always using our telephone, so I hardly had the chance for a nice long talk with my parents. I think it was a good experience for me, but I'm glad to be home! Alvin Chen - Hong Kong Studying in New Zealand was a fun experience for me, but it was also lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week----with lots of homework. I also kept a diary of my experience. I like to write, and I wrote two or three pages in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things about the culture. I'm really glad I went. Question: Where did Mariko visit?

Individuals often have a tendency to lump all debt together, when in reality debt differs significantly in cost, value, and risk. Knowing these differences helps you recognize which debt to tackle first.","completion":"In the following paragraph on how to start living a debt-free life, the discussion will continue by suggesting practical steps on prioritizing and tackling different types of debt, managing finances effectively, and avoiding future debt. Here's an outline of the possible content: 1. Prioritize your debt a. Pay off high-interest, unsecured debt first - For instance, credit card debts and payday loans typically have higher interest rates than secured debt. By focusing on reducing these debts first, you can save more money on interest charges and prevent them from ballooning. b. Consider refinancing or consolidating secured debts - If you have multiple secured debts such as mortgages, auto or student loans, explore the possibilities of refinancing or consolidating them if it leads to a lower interest rate. This can help in reducing the total debt repayment amount and make it easier for you to manage. 2. Develop a budget and track your expenses a. Create a realistic budget that suits your lifestyle and financial goals. Allocate chunks of your monthly income to essential expenses (rent, groceries, utilities), debt repayment, and savings. Stick to this budget to avoid unnecessary spending. b. Track your expenses and analyze your spending habits. Identify areas of excessive spending and find ways to cut back. For instance, if you spend too much on entertainment, look for inexpensive alternatives or limit your outings. 3. Establish an emergency fund a. Set aside money in an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses that would otherwise force you to rely on credit cards or loans. Start by saving a small amount each month and aim to build a fund that can cover at least three to six months' worth of living expenses. 4. Automate your debt payments a. Ensure timely debt repayments by setting up automatic deductions from your bank account towards your loans or credit card balances. This will help you avoid late payment fees and maintain a healthy credit score. 5. Review and monitor your credit a. Regularly review your credit reports to ensure accuracy and detect any fraudulent activity. Also, monitor your credit score and stay informed about factors affecting it. 6. Seek professional assistance a. If you feel overwhelmed by your debt situation, consider seeking the help of a financial advisor or a credit counselor. They can help create a personalized plan to pay off your debts and provide advice on improving your financial health. 7. Develop healthy financial habits a. Adopt long-term financial habits that focus on savings and responsible spending. For example, create a shopping list and avoid impulse purchases, use cash instead of credit for everyday expenses, and only take on debt for necessary investments like education or housing. By following these steps, individuals will not only effectively manage and eliminate their current debt, but also significantly reduce the risk of accumulating future debt. These strategies will empower them to create a stable financial foundation to work from and achieve their long-term financial goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in.

Illinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider says the party strongly rejects Jones' views and \\"his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District.\\" Nominations closed in December, meaning Jones, who openly states his anti-Semitic and white supremacist beliefs on his campaign website, is almost certain to appear on the ballot.

Jones has denounced Republican Illinois Gov.

Despite strong opposition to Jones' candidacy from the Illinois Republican Party, he is likely to appear on the ballot, unopposed in the March 20 primary. \\"I hate Illinois Nazis,\\" proclaimed John Belushi's character in the iconic film The Blues Brothers. One can't help but wonder how Belushi's character would react to Arthur Jones, the 70-year-old former leader of the American Nazi Party. Jones, who refers to the Holocaust as an \\"extortion racket,\\" has lost heavily in the district's GOP primary seven times over the last 20 years. However, with no other Republican candidates running in the primary, Jones appears to have a clear path to the nomination. Illinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider has denounced Jones and his views, stating that the party \\"strongly rejects Jones' candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District.\\" Although nominations closed in December, Jones, who openly states his anti-Semitic and white supremacist beliefs on his campaign website, is almost certain to appear on the ballot. Jones was removed from the race in 2016 after running unopposed for the GOP nomination when members of the Illinois Republican Party questioned the legitimacy of his nominating petitions. However, according to the Chicago Tribune, he seems to have obtained legitimate signatures this time around. Jones has criticized both Republican Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and President Donald Trump in the past, accusing Trump of having \\"surrounded himself with hordes of Jews.\\" But regardless of his potential nomination, prospects look grim for Jones' electoral success. The Washington Post reports that the district is heavily Democratic, and Jones is expected to lose to either Rep. Dan Lipinski or Democratic primary challenger Marie Newman in November.

Just like my fellow yelper, I too had purchased a warranty for 99.00. For some reason 6 months later the TV would turn but no picture. I called FRY's and they transferred me to the warranty department. I was told that someone would come to my home to fix it. In a few days 2 technicians from an LG approved company (no Frys) came and took 2 min. to let me know that I needed a new panel. They said they would be back next week to fix it. Three weeks go by, no call, no show. I called the company back and asked for status. They told me that Fry's denied the claim. They said I should call Fry's for more information. I called Fry's and they said they denied it because it was too expensive to purchase the new panel. I asked then why did I purchase this warranty for if it doesn't do me any good? They transferred me to a manager, Gabriel. He said I could exchange it. I told him I didn't want to do that because it's not a regular TV. Its an LG EZ Sign TV. He said he would check on it and that he or someone else would get back to me. It's been 3 days. No call from anyone. I won't be holding my breath. I'm still patiently waiting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s, I was in awe of this film. Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Europe and USA made you relate with what Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in your mind the \\"tyrannical\\" establishments and big business interests. The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert, the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water, painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even the staid British Airways did it a few years ago) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased their fan following after the film was released. You see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment films have more substance--facts, documentation, fine performances, and superb screenplays. Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a flawed genius. Even viewing Antonioni's \\"Blow Up\\" today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe. \\"Zabriski Point\\" has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens. The visual and aural (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) allure of the film still remains. The lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in USA extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film. Today, Antonioni seems out of \\"sync.\\" But watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors--Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies at the swimming pool, the cops at the air-strip. The real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.","completion":"The sentiment of the review can be interpreted as mixed to positive, with the reviewer appreciating the film for its historical significance and the emotions it evoked when it was first released. The writer acknowledges the film's visual and aural appeal, impact on popular culture, and its reflection of the events happening in the 1970s. Although the lead actors were not seen as exceptional, they were described as \\"cute and natural.\\" The reviewer also recognizes the talent and vision of the director, Michelangelo Antonioni, and his mastery of the medium, even though they believe his work may feel somewhat dated today. However, the sentiment becomes more negative when the reviewer reflects on their impression of the film after seeing it again 30 years later. They mention that the movie has lost its appeal and feels outdated when compared to contemporary anti-establishment films that have more substance in terms of facts, documentation, performances, and screenplay. Additionally, the reviewer feels that Antonioni's influence is now considered \\"passe\\" and his work is \\"out-of-sync.\\" In summary, the sentiment of the review seems to be predominantly positive when looking back on the film and its historical context, but the reviewer has lingering feelings of disappointment and disillusionment when comparing it to modern film standards. Nonetheless, they still acknowledge and respect Antonioni's skills as a filmmaker and his significant contributions to cinema."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Review: I've followed The Motels since 1982's All Four One album, but it's their greatest hits package that stands out. 19 tracks, all of them great post-punk and punk songs. It's difficult to categorize The Motels because they incorporate elements of punk, new wave and adult contemporary. Their individual albums are not quite as solid as this hits package, but you might want to listen to 1982's All Four One cd. The Motels disbanded in 1985, after the release of Shock. Martha did a solo cd in 1987, and then in 1990 this hits package was released. The hits are all here: \\"Only the Lonely\\", \\"Take the L\\", \\"Suddenly, Last Summer\\" and \\"Shame\\" plus other non-hits like \\"Icy Red\\", \\"So L.A.\\", \\"Who's Problem Am I?\\", \\"Kix\\", \\"Total Control\\" and \\"Danger\\".

Translate this to English?","completion":"The Community industrial designs system and the international registration system established by the Geneva Act complement each other. In detail, the Community industrial designs system refers to the design protection system within the European Union, providing protection for the appearance of a product resulting from its features such as lines, contours, colors, shape, texture, or materials. This system is governed by the Council Regulation (EC) No. 6/2002, which is a legal framework that aims to harmonize the rules for protecting designs within the EU member states. Under this system, when a design is registered, it offers protection of that design throughout the entire European Union as a Registered Community Design (RCD). On the other hand, the international registration system established by the Geneva Act, known as the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs, allows designers to protect their designs globally by filing only one application at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This system simplifies the process of obtaining protection for designs in multiple countries and reduces costs, time, and administrative efforts. The Geneva Act came into existence in 1999 as a revision of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs, and it enhances the international design registration system by providing more flexibility, diversity, and cooperation among its member states. Hence, both the Community industrial designs system and the international registration system established by the Geneva Act complement each other by providing different levels of design protection - one at the European Union level and the other at a global level. These systems facilitate designers to efficiently register and protect their designs in multiple jurisdictions while optimizing the entire registration process. By working in conjunction with each other, the two systems significantly contribute to the development, promotion, and enforcement of intellectual property rights related to industrial designs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its purpose was the negotiation of a treaty to replace the Treaty of Sèvres, which, under the new government of the Grand National Assembly, was no longer recognised by Turkey. The conference opened in November 1922, with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Turkey. It heard speeches from Benito Mussolini of Italy and Raymond Poincaré of France. At its conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the \\"freedom of the straits\\", which was Britain's main concern. The matter of the status of Mosul was deferred, since Curzon refused to be budged on the British position that the area was part of Iraq. The British Iraq Mandate's possession of Mosul was confirmed by a League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain in 1926. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of their goals and on 30 January 1923 issued a statement that they did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a \\"basis of discussion\\". The Turks therefore refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to Ismet Pasha to sign, and when he refused the Foreign Secretary broke off negotiations and left that night on the Orient Express.

A: This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: In the context of the sport of football (soccer), only the goalkeeper can handle the ball with their hands, but under specific conditions. The rules of the game indicate that the goalkeeper can use their hands only within the penalty area, which is an 18-yard box surrounding their goal. The purpose of these rules is to provide a fair and balanced gameplay experience, as well as to define the roles and responsibilities of different players on the field. When inside the penalty area, the goalkeeper is allowed to handle the ball to block shots, catch crosses, and initiate their team's attacking moves by distributing the ball to their teammates. However, when outside of the penalty area, the goalkeeper must follow the same rules as other players, and handling the ball will result in a free kick for the opposing team. It is essential to remember that there are specific instances when even the goalkeeper is not allowed to handle the ball with their hands, such as receiving a back-pass from their teammate using feet or when they are already holding the ball. In such cases, they are expected to play the ball with their feet like any other player on the field. In summary, only the goalkeeper can handle the ball with their hands, but this privilege is restricted within the penalty area and subject to specific rules and conditions. Violation of these rules might result in penalizing the offending team, potentially providing the opposing team with an advantage, such as a free kick or even a penalty kick if the infringement occurs within the penalty area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is the client Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch? The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly! The pig - confused about everything he has seen - goes to psychiatrist Dr. Cy Kosis for counseling. Kosis realizes he needs counseling (and joins his client on the couch) when he sees the Barnyard Dawg flying by the window.

Write a text based on this summary: candidates withdraw from local elections in nepal Text:","completion":"Title: Unprecedented Wave of Withdrawals Hit Local Elections in Nepal In a surprising turn of events, numerous candidates have decided to withdraw from the upcoming local elections in Nepal. The move has left political analysts and the electorate questioning the state of democracy in the country. This unprecedented wave of withdrawals has the potential to reshape the political landscape and further complicate the already challenging process of democratic governance in Nepal. Nepal, a small landlocked country sandwiched between India and China, has experienced severe political turmoil in the past. The country transitioned to a democratic system of governance after years of autocratic rule and a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006. However, the journey towards establishing a stable political establishment has been fraught with challenges, including the elusive search for political consensus among various national and regional political players. The recent announcement by several candidates to withdraw from the local elections has intensified the ongoing debate surrounding the functionality and integrity of Nepal's political system. The reasons for these withdrawals are manifold but appear to stem from a combination of personal, political, and financial considerations. Firstly, some candidates have cited a lack of confidence in the electoral process as their primary reason for withdrawal. The increasing instances of violence and intimidation at the polls have led to heightened concerns about the safety and security of those running for office. Moreover, allegations of vote rigging and other forms of electoral malpractice have further undermined the credibility and trust in the electoral system. Another contributing factor is the dissatisfaction with the political parties themselves. Many candidates who have withdrawn from the race have cited disillusion with their party's internal workings and lack of transparency in the nomination process. The perception of nepotism and favoritism within party structures, along with the underrepresentation of women, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups, has led to an erosion of faith in the very institutions meant to uphold democratic values. Moreover, financial pressures have also caused some candidates to rethink their electoral ambitions. Running for office is an expensive endeavor, with significant outlays required for campaigns, advertising, and general logistics. For many prospective candidates, the daunting prospect of raising the necessary funds was enough to dissuade them from pursuing their political ambitions. It is worth noting that the wave of withdrawals has affected various political parties across the spectrum, with both the ruling and opposition parties witnessing a similar trend. This phenomenon serves to underscore the deep-rooted issues that plague the political system in Nepal. The implications of these withdrawals on the local elections are far-reaching and could significantly alter the political landscape at the grassroots level. The withdrawal of prominent candidates has the potential to pave the way for less experienced individuals to fill the positions. This could lead to a lack of qualified leadership, mismanagement, and incompetence – the very issues that a functioning local government needs to combat. Furthermore, these withdrawals have the potential to weaken the local democratic process by eroding public trust in the electoral system and reducing voter turnout. The absence of strong candidates may make people feel disillusioned by the electoral process and less likely to participate. The Nepalese government, the election commission, and political parties must take this issue seriously and strive to address the underlying factors responsible for this sudden exodus. Robust policy measures aimed at ensuring the safety and security of candidates, promoting transparency in the nomination process, addressing the underrepresentation of marginalized groups, and offering financial support to lesser-endowed candidates are just a few initiatives essential to bolster the electoral process. In conclusion, the recent wave of candidate withdrawals from local elections in Nepal signifies a concerning trend of disillusionment and instability within the political sphere. It is crucial for the success of democracy in the country that urgent and tangible steps are taken to redress these issues, thereby ensuring the integrity, credibility, and strength of local governance, and ultimately, the democratic process itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Paragraph: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.

Given the context: How would you describe Bailey? pick from the following. [+] happy to be done with work; [+] tired and ready for bed; [+] busy; Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it would be appropriate to describe Bailey as a combination of tired and ready for bed and busy. The reason behind this characterization is as follows: 1. Tired and ready for bed: Bailey works at night, which implies that they might be following a nocturnal schedule and are often awake during the hours when most people are asleep. This can be quite physically and mentally draining due to the body's natural sleep cycle and the fact that the majority of people in society tend to be active during the day. Following a night shift, Bailey goes to the store early in the morning, which means that they likely have limited time to rest between work and their personal errands. This can certainly contribute to feelings of tiredness and the desire to go to bed once their tasks are completed. 2. Busy: In addition to working at night, Bailey also finds time to run errands such as going to the store early in the morning. This demonstrates that they have a packed schedule and a good amount of responsibilities, both professional and personal, to manage. As a result, it is quite conceivable that Bailey leads a busy life, trying to juggle multiple roles and tasks. While it is possible that Bailey may also be happy to be done with work, there is not enough context provided to confidently infer that emotion. Happiness could vary depending on their level of satisfaction with their job or personal circumstances, which the information given does not elucidate.

Answer the following question: Process: - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed - Different kinds of sickness are formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more bacteria present happens, how will it affect less bacteria enters the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis considers alterations or disturbances in a system or process, which can cause changes in the dynamics of that system. In the context of the given question, the perturbation refers to the presence of either more or fewer bacteria than normal in the body. To analyze if this perturbation has an effect on the process, we must first understand the process itself. When bacteria enter the body, they pass through various barriers such as skin and mucous membranes before reaching the bloodstream. Once present in the bloodstream, the circulating bacteria will come into contact with various types of cells that constitute the immune system. These immune cells are designed to detect and eliminate pathogens, such as bacteria, from the body. When bacteria invade and attack cells in the body, the immune system responds with a heightened inflammatory response to try and destroy the bacteria. If the immune system is successful in this process, it will effectively protect the body from infection. However, if the immune system is unable to neutralize the bacteria or if the infection is left untreated, the spread and impact of the bacteria on the host's cells can lead to cell death. The death of these cells can result in different kinds of illness or sickness, depending on the specific type of bacteria and the organ system affected by the infection. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis in this context, we will analyze how an altered amount of bacteria entering the body (either more or less than usual) could affect the process: 1. More bacteria entering the body: If more bacteria than normal are present in the body, the immune system will need to work harder to protect the host. The increased bacterial load may overwhelm the immune system and lead to a higher chance of cells being attacked and killed, resulting in more severe or prolonged sickness. The indirect effect of this can be the immune system becoming overloaded, causing a negative impact on overall health and potentially making the host more susceptible to other infections. Furthermore, administering antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection could potentially lead to antibiotic resistance due to the presence of a larger population of bacteria. 2. Less bacteria entering the body: If there is a lower amount of bacteria entering the body, the immune system may be more effective at neutralizing the pathogens before they can cause significant damage to cells. The reduced bacterial load can result in a quicker recovery time, with fewer cells being attacked and killed, and milder symptoms of sickness. An indirect effect of this scenario is that the host's immune system remains functional and does not become overwhelmed, maintaining a good level of overall health and a lower risk of secondary infections. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis, regarding the change in the amount of bacteria present in the body, can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of bacterial infection. These effects can manifest themselves in the form of severity of sickness, immune system function, duration of illness, and potential development of antibiotic resistance. The overall health of the affected individual and the body's ability to combat infections depend on the balance between the bacterial load and the effectiveness of the immune response."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following statements best explains this difference? Select from: (i). Eukaryotic cells are smaller than prokaryotic cells. (ii). Eukaryotic cells have less DNA than prokaryotic cells. (iii). Eukaryotic cells have more cell walls than prokaryotic cells. (iv). Eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells.","completion":"(iv). Eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells. To understand why eukaryotic cells do not divide as quickly as prokaryotic cells, it is crucial to know the differences between the two types of cells in terms of their size, genetic material, and structure. The statement that best explains this difference is that eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells. Although some elements of the other statements might be true or contribute to the overall difference in cell division rates, the primary cause lies in their structural complexity. Size and DNA content: Eukaryotic cells are generally bigger than prokaryotic cells, and eukaryotic cells have more DNA than prokaryotic cells. In fact, eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, which houses their genetic material, while prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and have a single, circular DNA molecule floating in the cytoplasm. Thus, statements (i) and (ii) do not accurately explain the difference in replication speed. Cell walls: Statement (iii) is incorrect, as eukaryotic cells typically have fewer cell walls than prokaryotic cells. Among eukaryotes, fungi and plant cells have cell walls, while animal cells do not. Prokaryotic cells, however, generally have a cell wall, often consisting of peptidoglycan. Structural complexity: Eukaryotic cells are structurally more complex than prokaryotic cells, leading to a slower rate of cell division. This complexity results from the presence of numerous membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts in plant cells. Additionally, eukaryotic cells possess a more extensive and elaborate cytoskeleton than prokaryotic cells, which plays a crucial role in orchestrating cell division. The process of cell division in eukaryotes involves a series of carefully regulated steps, including DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and the dismantling and reformation of the nuclear envelope. The presence of multiple chromosomes also makes the segregation process more complicated in eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes. Moreover, the mitotic spindle, which is involved in chromosome separation, has to be carefully assembled and disassembled during eukaryotic cell division. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, can divide more rapidly due to their simpler structure and relatively lower amount of genetic material. The process of prokaryotic cell division, called binary fission, is far less complicated than eukaryotic cell division and involves fewer steps. As a result, prokaryotic cells can reproduce much faster than eukaryotic cells, potentially dividing multiple times per hour. In conclusion, the primary reason eukaryotic cells do not divide as quickly as prokaryotic cells is their increased structural complexity. This complexity necessitates more extensive and intricate cellular processes during division, leading to a slower rate of reproduction compared to the simpler, more streamlined binary fission seen in prokaryotic cells."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The given statement is from the perspective of a decision-maker involved in negotiations. They are briefly explaining that they have resolved to continue the discussion regarding a new agreement between the European Union (EU) and Russia. This is despite the unspecified incidents that happened in Georgia in the month of August. It is insinuated that these events had the potential to disrupt or end these negotiations. To further understand the context, it's crucial to be aware that the EU and Russia have a vast, complex and significant relationship, encompassing an array of issues from trade and economic cooperation to security and political dialogue. This relationship has, however, often been characterized by tension and disagreement, influenced by various socio-political events, not least those that relate to Georgia, a country that has its own complicated history with Russia.

She attended Edinburgh Acting School and took part in the Edinburgh Fringe. She also long participated in her parish church's pilgrimages to the Knock Shrine, County Mayo, Ireland, and sang there at the Marian basilica. In 1995, she auditioned for Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People. In 1999, Boyle submitted a track for a charity CD to commemorate the Millennium produced at a West Lothian school. Only 1,000 copies of the CD, Music for a Millennium Celebration, Sounds of West Lothian, were pressed. An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \\"not a one-trick pony.\\" Hello! said the recording \\"cement[ed] her status\\" as a singing star. In 1998, Boyle recorded three tracks--\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Killing Me Softly\\", and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--at Heartbeat Studio, Midlothian. She used all her savings to pay for a professionally cut demo, copies of which she later sent to record companies, radio talent competitions, local and national TV. The demo consisted of her versions of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"; the songs were uploaded to the Internet after her BGT audition. After Boyle won several local singing competitions, her mother urged her to enter Britain's Got Talent and take the risk of singing in front of an audience larger than her parish church. Former coach O'Neil said Boyle abandoned an audition for The X Factor because she believed people were being chosen for their looks. She almost abandoned her plan to enter Britain's Got Talent believing she was too old, but O'Neil persuaded her to audition nevertheless. Boyle said that she was motivated to seek a musical career to pay tribute to her mother. Her performance on the show was the first time she had sung in public since her mother died. In August 2008, Boyle applied for an audition for the third series of Britain's Got Talent (as contestant number 43212) and was accepted after a preliminary audition in Glasgow. When Boyle first appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the city's Clyde Auditorium, she said that she aspired to become a professional singer \\"as successful as Elaine Paige\\". Boyle sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables in the first round, which was watched by over 10 million viewers when it aired on 11 April 2009. Programme judge Amanda Holden remarked upon the audience's initially cynical attitude, and the subsequent \\"biggest wake-up call ever\\" upon hearing her performance. Boyle was \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" by the strength of the reaction to her appearance. Afterwards, Paige expressed interest in singing a duet with Boyle, and called her \\"a role model for everyone who has a dream\\". Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was credited with causing a surge in ticket sales in the Vancouver production of Les Miserables. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of the musical, also praised the performance, as \\"heart-touching, thrilling and uplifting\\". Boyle was one of 40 acts that were put through to the semi-finals. She appeared last on the first semi-final on 24 May 2009, performing \\"Memory\\" from the musical Cats. In the public vote, she was the act to receive the highest number of votes to go through to the final. She was the clear favourite to win the final, but ended up in second place to dance troupe Diversity; the UK TV audience was a record of 17.3 million viewers. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) became concerned by press reports about Boyle's erratic behaviour and speculation about her mental condition and wrote to remind editors about clause 3 (privacy) of their code of press conduct. The day after the final, Boyle was admitted to The Priory, a private psychiatric clinic in London, Talkback Thames explained, \\"Following Saturday night's show, Susan is exhausted and emotionally drained.\\" Her stay in hospital attracted widespread attention, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown wishing her well. Cowell offered to waive Boyle's contractual obligation to take part in the BGT tour. Her family said \\"she's been battered non-stop for the last seven weeks and it has taken its toll [...but...] her dream is very much alive,\\" as she had been invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the White House. Boyle left the clinic three days after her admission and said she would participate in the BGT tour. Despite health concerns, she appeared in 20 of the 24 dates of the tour, and was well received in cities including Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dublin, Sheffield, Coventry, and Birmingham. The Belfast Telegraph stated that \\"Despite reports of crumbling under the pressure..., she exuded a confidence resembling that of a veteran who has been performing for years\\". Boyle's first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released on 23 November 2009. The album includes covers of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"You'll See\\" as well as \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", and \\"Cry Me a River\\". In Britain, Boyle's debut album was recognised as the fastest selling UK debut album of all time selling 411,820 copies, beating the previous fastest selling debut of all time, Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream also outsold the rest of the top 5 albums combined in its first week. In the US, the album sold 701,000 copies in its first week, the best opening week for a debut artist in over a decade. It topped the Billboard chart for six straight weeks and although it narrowly failed to become the best-selling album of 2009, with sales of 3,104,000 compared to 3,217,000 for Taylor Swift's Fearless, it was one of only two albums to sell over 3 million copies in the US, and was also the top selling \\"physical\\" album of 2009, with only 86,000 of its sales coming from digital downloads. This has in turn garnered more media attention, as mentioned by People magazine. In Italy, it was the first album of the month in the Italian No. 1 Account by a non-Italian artist ever. In only a week, it sold more than 2 million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest selling global female debut album. On 13 December 2009 she appeared in her own television special \\"I Dreamed a Dream: the Susan Boyle Story\\", featuring a duet with Elaine Paige. It got ratings of 10 million viewers in the United Kingdom and in America was the TV Guide Network's highest rated television special in its history. In November 2009 it was reported that Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" would be the theme song of the anime movie Eagle Talon The Movie 3 which was later released in Japan on 16 January 2010. Boyle performed for Pope Benedict XVI on his tour of Britain in 2010. In May 2010, Boyle was voted by Time magazine as the seventh most influential person in the world.

Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant). That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordans home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordans final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.

One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern.

A more suitable and detailed answer to the question would be: Winston Churchill attended several schools throughout his early life, which were pivotal in shaping his future as a prominent statesman and his contributions during World War II. Churchill's formal education began at St. George's School in Ascot, Berkshire, which he joined in 1882 at the age of eight. However, he struggled academically and did not enjoy his time at the school, partly due to the strict environment and frequent punishments. His poor performance led to his parents transferring him to Brunswick School in Hove in 1883, where he showed an aptitude for English, but his overall academic performance was still below average. In 1888, at the age of thirteen, Churchill joined Harrow School, an all-boys boarding school in London. Although his academic struggles continued, particularly in subjects like Latin and mathematics, he began to develop an interest in history and military strategy. He excelled in these areas, which would later prove essential to his political career and leadership during World War II. During his time at Harrow, Churchill also joined the Harrow Rifle Corps, where he gained practical experience in military drills and rifle shooting. After his time at Harrow, Churchill aimed to join the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, but it took him three attempts to pass the entrance exams. He was eventually accepted, and from 1893 to 1894, Churchill attended the Royal Military College, where he enjoyed the structured and disciplined environment. He graduated with honors and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, shortly after which he embarked on the illustrious political and military career that would define his legacy. In conclusion, while the given answer option highlights Winston Churchill's family background, it does not address his educational history. To answer the question of where Winston Churchill went to school, it is essential to discuss institutions like St. George's School, Brunswick School, Harrow School, and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which played a significant role in molding his character and future achievements."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Q: Met, asn, trp, and gln connect together like beads on a necklace and are an example of what type of acids?

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: Two campers were in the woods over the week-end.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about.

Gordon Parks, the prolific black Life magazine photographer, made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around! Based upon the true story of two NYC cops - later dubbed Batman and Robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs, this is a cop-buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula. Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here. Man, early '70s NYC must have been a terrible place to be a police officer, from the looks of movies like this and \\"Serpico.\\" These two cops start out as safety-division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time. But instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers. They have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption, boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets, ruthless drug kingpins, and a nasty ghetto neighborhood. Both David Selby and Ron Leibman are fantastic in the leads; part of the entertainment is watching Leibman's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance, and Selby's acting is low-key and wry. These two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination. Director Parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography, does not shy away from the grittiness of the story. Rather, the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit. Adding to this realism is the fact that the real Hantz and Greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film, and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists. It is a real tribute to the effectiveness of Parks' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy.

Article: Most of the time, we choose colors for decorating based on our personal taste and our sense of aesthetics . But, a number of color experts believe that colors have an effect on our emotions and that it would be wise of us to be conscious of that before settling on a definite choice. Some of the effects of colors are well known and accepted by most people. In fact, those effects have been the subject of serious research and experiments and have been scientifically proven. But not all scientists agree on the validity of the results. When we become interested in the psychological effects of colors, it is important to know that not all societies share our opinion of those effects on our emotions. What we hold as an \\"objective\\" observation on a color is often nothing more than a reflection of our cultural belongingness, which has attributed properties to that color for generations. Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? In part, because it is very difficult to separate the psychological from the symbolic, the symbolic aspects are definitely cultural. Often, and this without our realizing it, they influence our understanding of colors and the following emotions - both psychological aspects. Black and white are good examples. In western countries, black is considered serious, dramatic and sometimes sad. People are warned against its potentially depressing effects on decoration. Black is the traditional color of mourning. White, on the other hand, is associated with purity, peace and optimism. For those reasons, white is the traditional color of bridal dresses. No one would think of attending a funeral in white. Any more than it would occur to a bride to wear black. We simply remain convinced that it is not in the \\"nature\\" of those colors. Yet, in certain oriental countries, it is white, not black that is the color of mourning.

One of the main reasons it is challenging to separate the psychological from the symbolic aspects is that these symbolic associations are often so deeply ingrained in our understanding of colors that they influence our emotions and the way we perceive the world around us. These cultural associations can be passed down through generations, making it difficult to see colors without the filter of cultural symbolism. The example of black and white demonstrates how different cultural perspectives can shape our understanding of colors. In Western countries, black is typically associated with seriousness, drama, and sadness, while white is linked to purity, peace, and optimism. However, in certain Eastern cultures, the color white is actually associated with mourning, reflecting a completely different meaning. This cultural influence makes it challenging for people from different backgrounds to have a truly objective discussion about the psychological effects of colors. Furthermore, the scientific research on the effects of colors has not reached a consensus, and not all scientists agree on the validity of the results. This uncertainty in the scientific field adds another layer of complexity when trying to establish objectivity in discussing colors and their emotional impact. In summary, the main reason it is not possible for us to hold a truly objective discourse on the subject of color psychology is the significant influence of cultural backgrounds, symbolic associations, and differing scientific opinions. These factors create an intricate web of subjectivity that makes it challenging for individuals or groups to discuss and understand colors without personal and cultural biases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"1979\\" is a song by American alternative rock band, The Smashing Pumpkins, and serves as the second single from their third studio album, \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" The song was released on October 23, 1995, in the United Kingdom. The title, \\"1979,\\" is a reference to lead singer and songwriter Billy Corgan's birth year and an ode to the nostalgia of youth. The Smashing Pumpkins, formed in Chicago in 1988, consist of lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan, guitarist James Iha, bassist D'arcy Wretzky, and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The band is known for their diverse musical style, incorporating elements of alternative rock, heavy metal, gothic rock, and electronica. \\"1979\\" is a departure from the band's typical heavier sound, taking on a more melodic and dreamy approach. The lyrics explore themes of youth, nostalgia, and the fleeting nature of time. The song is memorable for its distinct guitar riff and Corgan's soft, introspective vocal delivery. The music video for \\"1979,\\" directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, depicts the band as teenagers driving around their suburban neighborhood wreaking havoc and attending a house party. The video's concept, like the song itself, explores a sense of youthful freedom and chaos, capturing both the excitement and the uncertainty of adolescence. \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" the album that features \\"1979,\\" was released on October 24, 1995. The ambitious double album spans two hours and includes a wide range of musical styles, from heavy rock to mellow ballads. It received widespread critical acclaim and topped the Billboard charts upon its release. \\"1979\\" is considered one of The Smashing Pumpkins' most iconic and successful songs. It reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. In addition, \\"1979\\" garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and its music video earned multiple nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, winning Best Alternative Video.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much!

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

But let me make it simpler for a five-year-old. When Einstein came up with general relativity, it was a new idea to explain how things like planets and stars move.

Its members consist of record labels and distributors, which the RIAA says \\"create, manufacture and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legally sold recorded music in the United States.\\" The RIAA headquarters is in Washington, D.C. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name . The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in late 2008 . - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in July 1999 by Benny Brown, the label specializes in country music. The label's general manager is Jon Loba. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Jason Aldine Williams (born February 28, 1977), known professionally as Jason Aldean, is an American singer.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway.

Question: \\"What type of media did Norte Dame have for those who listened to news on ear buds but not visually\\" Context: \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Notre Dame had a radio station for those who listened to news on earbuds but not visually.

Subtract the constant term (1209) from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable. This helps to get rid of any constants that don't involve the variable we're solving for. 119*h + 1209 - 1209 = 19 - 1209 119*h = -1190 3. Now we have an equation where the left side is only a multiplication of the variable (h) and a constant (119). To solve for h, we need to undo the multiplication and isolate the variable. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the constant (119) in front of the variable (h). (119*h) / 119 = -1190 / 119 h = -10 4. Now we've solved for h.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Here's a question: Where can a grain of sand cause a person a lot of pain and possible damage sight? Here are possible answers to this question: - eye - clam - bathing suit - shoes - beach I believe the correct choice is \\"eye\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"eye,\\" and there are several key reasons why a grain of sand in the eye can cause a person substantial discomfort and potentially damage their sight. First, let us consider the structural and functional aspects of the human eye. The eye is a delicate and highly sensitive organ, featuring multiple components working together to provide our sense of sight. Key components include the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and the optic nerve, amongst others. Each of these components plays a specific role in the overall process of vision, and any direct damage or irritation to any of these parts can result in disruption of that process. Now, let's examine how and why a grain of sand can inflict pain and potentially harm these components: 1. Corneal abrasion: The cornea is the transparent outer layer at the front of the eye, responsible for refracting light onto the lens and retina. A grain of sand coming into direct contact with the cornea can cause corneal abrasion or a scratch to the surface. Because the cornea has a high concentration of nerve endings, even a tiny scratch can cause significant pain, tearing, and sensitivity to light. 2. Inflammation: When a foreign object, like a grain of sand, enters the eye, the body's natural response is to produce inflammation. This can manifest itself as redness, swelling, and discomfort in the affected area. Prolonged inflammation may even lead to complications in vision or cause other eye-related issues. 3. Infection: If the grain of sand carries bacteria or other pathogens, and it lodges itself within the eye, it can introduce infection to the sensitive ocular structures. Left untreated, such an infection can cause further inflammation, pain, and potentially permanent damage to one's sight. 4. Irritation to other structures: Apart from the cornea, a grain of sand could also irritate other structures within the eye, such as the conjunctiva – the clear, thin membrane that covers the sclera (white part) and inside of the eyelids. This could lead to conjunctivitis, also known as \\"pink eye\\", which can be highly uncomfortable and contagious in some forms. In comparison to the other options listed - clam, bathing suit, shoes, and beach - none of these alternatives pose a direct threat to one's sight and intense pain in the same manner that a grain of sand can when it enters the eye. These alternatives may indeed cause discomfort in other ways, such as a grain of sand within a shoe causing abrasion on the foot, or sand in a bathing suit leading to chafing; however, these scenarios do not present the same level of risk to a person's vision as the \\"eye\\" option does. In conclusion, a grain of sand entering the eye can be not only incredibly painful but can also lead to complications such as corneal abrasion, inflammation, infection, and damage to other ocular structures. For these reasons, the \\"eye\\" is the correct choice in answering the question of where a grain of sand can cause a person the most pain and potential sight-related issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: A. no; B. yes;","completion":"A. No, the questions have different meanings. The first question asks about how a decrease in oil prices can affect people's everyday life. When oil prices go down, it usually means things like gasoline for cars and other things that use oil become cheaper. This can make people happy because they save money when they fill up their cars with gas or use things made from oil. The second question is about an agreement or MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Abu Dhabi to store some of Abu Dhabi's crude oil in India's reserves. This might affect global oil prices in the future, but it's not the same as asking how a decrease in oil prices affects people's lives directly.

I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments.

For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished. Answer this question please: Which island experienced more environmental degradation? A:","completion":"Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation due to the overhunting of a few animal species, contributing to their extinction. Although both islands have similar ecosystems and are identical in size, the difference in human behavior and their impact on the flora and fauna of each island led to distinct environmental outcomes. Caribu island's natives hunted multiple animal species, which likely caused local reduction or loss of species in their habitat. This decline in the number of animal species ultimately led to a decrease in local biodiversity. When biodiversity loss occurs, it can have a cascading impact on the entire ecosystem. Food webs and food chains become disrupted, as the extinction or reduction of a single species can adversely affect all other organisms that depend on it, whether directly or indirectly. On the other hand, Hiji island had inhabitants that were pescatarian and rarely fished. This indicates that the people of Hiji island had a lesser impact on the habitats and populations of local species. As a result, the island's biodiversity was likely more stable and resilient, allowing the ecosystem to maintain a healthier balance of flora and fauna. The ecological effects of biodiversity loss are usually countered by efforts to preserve or restore the affected ecosystems. However, in the case of Caribu island, the permanent extinction of some species means that the consequences are irreversible, leaving lasting harm to the environment. Reduced biodiversity also leads to decreased ecosystem services, negatively affecting the quality of life not only for the native inhabitants who depend on the surrounding environment for various resources but also posing a threat to global food security. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation as compared to Hiji island due to the human activities and their impacts on the local biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

PUBLISHED:. 06:32 EST, 13 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:03 EST, 14 November 2012. The crippling rise in university tuition fees has fuelled the biggest increase in the cost of living for more than a year, official figures revealed yesterday. Inflation jumped to 2.7 per cent in October, up from 2.2 per cent in September. This means it has been above the Government target of two per cent since November 2009, when it stood at 1.9 per cent. The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation rose to 2.7 per cent - a bigger-than-expected increase after falling steadily since June. The rise of nearly 20 per cent in. education costs helped push up the figure, said the Office for National. Statistics. It is the largest monthly increase in this category since. its records began in 1996. Tuition fees rose to up to £9,000 a year from September. Andrew Goodwin, of accountants’ Ernst. & Young’s ITEM Club, said the sharp rise in the Consumer Price. Index was ‘a very nasty surprise’ at a time when Britons are still. suffering a squeeze on their incomes. The ONS figures also showed that the price of essentials was still rising. Between September and October,. clothes and shoes cost 1.2 per cent more and food jumped 0.5 per cent,. with the rise blamed mainly on meat, fish, fruit and sugar. The cost of living has risen sharply, fuelled by increases in food prices and the trebling of tuition fees. The Treasury said the figures were. ‘disappointing’ as experts predicted the Consumer Prices Index would. break through three per cent by the New Year. Inflation had been steadily falling in recent months after peaking at 5.2 per cent in September 2011. But the rate of rises in prices. continues to outstrip pay increases for those in work, leaving millions. of families worse off every month in real terms. The ONS said education costs jumped by 19.1 per cent last month - the largest increase since records began. It follows the government’s decision to increase tuition fees from £3,375 to up to £9,000. The decision to increase tuition fees to £9,000, which triggered angry protests and clashes between students and police, has fuelled a sharp rise in inflation. Terrible. weather this summer has blighted crops, in particular potatoes and. carrot harvests. As a result food prices have risen sharply. Since. last month’s most of the big energy firms have announced major. increases in prices which are likely to bump up inflation in the coming. weeks and months. Some experts think CPI could reach 3.5 per cent by the middle of next year. James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, said he expected inflation to rise to 3 per cent by January.Economist Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said the inflation data provides an ‘uncomfortable backdrop’ to the Bank of England’s inflation report tomorrow. ‘Nonetheless, we still think that the weakness of economic activity will bring inflation down further in time,’ he added. This week the government managed to quell a rebellion from Tory backbenchers over a planned 3p rise in fuel duty with a promise that more help for hard-pressed families will be announced in next month's autumn budget. Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This is a worrying increase in the inflation rate. But instead of easing the squeeze, the Government is adding to the cost of living crisis for people on low and middle incomes.’","completion":"This news article tells us that the cost of living for people in the UK went up a lot because of university tuition fees getting higher. Inflation, which is when prices of things we buy go up, increased from 2.2% to 2.7% in October 2012. The price of things like clothes, shoes, and food also went up, making life harder for many families. The government says they are disappointed with these numbers and they think they will keep going up. This is important because when prices go up, it can be tough for people to afford what they need."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You should find the maximum absolute difference between 2 integers in the list. The absolute difference is the absolute value of one integer subtracted by another. The output should be a single integer which is the largest possible absolute distance. Problem:[22, 1, 84, -19, -30, -6, 64, 12] Solution:","completion":"1. First, to solve this task, we need to find the maximum and minimum values in the list. List: [22, 1, 84, -19, -30, -6, 64, 12] 2. Initialize two variables called max_value and min_value, and assign to them the first element of the list as their initial values. max_value = 22 min_value = 22 3. Iterate through the list to compare each element with the current max_value and min_value, updating them accordingly. 4. For 1, since it's smaller than min_value (22): - Update min_value: min_value = 1 5. Continue iterating through the list and comparing each element: - For 84, update max_value (84 > 22): max_value = 84 - For -19, update min_value (-19 < 1): min_value = -19 - For -30, update min_value (-30 < -19): min_value = -30 - For -6, no updates needed - For 64, no updates needed - For 12, no updates needed 6. Now, we have the maximum value (84) and minimum value (-30) in the list. 7. To find the maximum absolute difference, calculate the absolute value of max_value subtracted by min_value: max_abs_difference = abs(84 - (-30)) = abs(84 + 30) = abs(114) = 114 8.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please write a short summary for the following article: Visualizing 'Officer-Involved' Deaths Across America: Photos A cookie-cut subdivision, a mall parking lot, a rural country road. Linking these unremarkable pockets of America, and hundreds of places just as ordinary, is the fact that they’ve all been sites where people were killed by U.S. police officers in a variety of situations. Josh Begley, a research editor at The Intercept, an investigative journalism outlet focused on governance, surveillance, civil liberties and security, launched the project Officer Involved to visualize these dispersed locations, creating an ever-evolving portrait of death with each site represented by a Google Maps screen grab or by a Google Street View still image. Both the detachment of the Maps birds-eye-view and the soft-focus and warped perspective of Google Street View have the effect of unnerving the viewer. The accompanying caption info is simply the victim’s name followed by the city and state where death occurred. Officer Involved “is an immersion in the environment of someone’s last moments,” writes Teju Cole in the introduction to the project, with the relentlessness of Google’s mechanical eyes and capture ratcheting a mood of disturbed natural order that runs through the work. “It’s a lot of ghosted intersections,” says Begley. The names of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice are etched in our collective memory, inspiring the Black Lives Matter movement and igniting a national debate about violence, institutional racism and police oversight. However, for the few names we know and remember, there are hundreds that are quickly forgotten, if acknowledged at all. One of the more remarkable things about Officer Involved is that the data upon which it is built did not exist until very recently. In the wake of the high profile killings such as Garner, Brown and Rice, journalists, activists and politicians alike wanted answers. However, solid statistics were not readily available. Police forces, sheriff departments and federal agencies had not been required to keep figures on officer-involved deaths and there certainly was no central database. Fatal Encounters a database administered by Reno News & Review journalist D. Brian Burghart has slowly amassed records on officer-involved deaths dating back to the year 2000, but real-time statistics have never been reliably accessible. Until now. Early in 2015, The Guardian set about sourcing and presenting information in The Counted, which uses local news reports, among other sources, to count the death. Yet, Begley cannot be sure The Counted has a complete set of data. He is confident, however, that The Counted is the most complete data set out there. “The Guardian has a team of top-notch journalists—and the weight of a great institution behind them,” says Begley. “In the absence of official data, theirs is the best we’ve got.” In 2016, Federal authorities intend to catch up to the watchdog efforts of journalists. In December 2015, the FBI announced the launch of a database counting officer involved deaths. It has, for the past decade, underestimated the deaths by over 50% citing annual figures of 423, when The Guardian counted 1136 in 2015 alone. Politicians in some states have also begun efforts to chart figures in their own jurisdictions. In September, California’s Attorney General Kamala Harris launched OpenJustice, a transparency initiative that tracks arrests, custody and arrest-related deaths and the assault and killing of law enforcement officers. For Officer Involved, Begley uses two bits of code that rely heavily on Google’s Geocoding API, which converts addresses into geographic coordinates. The journalist ran one set of locations against the Static Maps API, and another set against the Street View API. (You can find a sample of the code here.) Begley conceived of the idea with Maya Raiford-Cohen, a young writer who has reported on the #BlackLivesMatter movement, among other things. When The Guardian published The Counted, Raiford-Cohen and Begley were both at an academic conference in Florence, Italy about black portraiture. Under a Tuscan sun, more than 5,000 miles from the deaths that concerned them, they pored over the information. “One of the first things Maya saw was how complete many of the data fields appeared to be—there are street addresses, for instance—so I started playing with the Google Maps API and examining what the data might be able to show us.” It didn’t take long for Begley to modify the script. Sensitively pairing the visuals with the memory of a human life cut short was much more taxing. “The bulk of my time was spent looking at the photographs,” says Begley. “Modifying Street View angles, and trying to sit still with the notion of premature death.” So far, Begley has generated 615 tiles, representing a little over half of the deaths recorded by The Guardian in 2015 alone. The Intercept rolled out Officer Involved in June 2015 yet, inasmuch as Begley is interpreting others’ reporting, he insists that the project is art, not journalism. He also maintains a perspective about the extent, or not, to which Officer Involved shifts the conversation. “Credit where it’s due: Mariame Kaba, Mervyn Marcano, Jesse Williams, Ashley Yates, dream hampton and the #BlackLivesMatter founders—Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi—have all done more to change the conversation about race and policing in this country than any visualization of data ever could.” Still, some are moved by visual “evidence” more than words or statistics. Sometimes an image gets to the point more directly. For those people, Begley and Raiford-Cohen’s Officer Involved is another point of entry into our current and urgent discussions about race and policing. Pete Brook is an independent writer and curator whose work focuses incarceration, power and images. He is founder of Prison Photography and editor of Vantage.

And the answer is?","completion":"The drink sometimes referred to as \\"Adam's ale\\" is water. This expression is derived from the biblical story of Adam, the first human created by God in the religious narratives of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The term \\"Adam's ale\\" implies that water was the only drink available to Adam in the Garden of Eden and symbolizes the pure and natural state of life during that time. Furthermore, it suggests that water is essential to all humans' existence and survival, as it would have been for Adam himself. Water is a fundamental and indispensable resource for everyone, as it is vital for numerous bodily functions, such as maintaining temperature, conducting metabolic processes, and providing the means for absorbing nutrients. Additionally, water is a part of implementing proper hygiene practices and contributing to our overall health. Historically, expressions like \\"Adam's ale\\" often arose from cultures or communities that valued purity or cleanliness in their daily lives. For example, during the Middle Ages, some people were known to avoid consuming alcoholic beverages, as they believed such substances were detrimental to their health or spirituality. On the other hand, clean water symbolized virtue and discipline by representing the original state of life. In summary, the drink known as \\"Adam's ale\\" refers to water, drawn from the biblical narrative of Adam, the first human, and represents the purity and importance of water throughout human history. As a fundamental resource for all life, water is crucial for our survival and maintaining overall well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation.

The popular Ariana Grande look swept the school and Angela became more popular than Betty because","completion":"of her uncanny resemblance to the pop star. Her long high ponytail, winged eyeliner, and oversized sweatshirts became the ultimate style inspiration for many of the students. Here's how it all began and the consequences it had on the school's social dynamics. Step 1: Recognizing the trend Initially, it was a handful of trend-savvy students who started replicating Ariana Grande's look by adopting her hairstyles and makeup techniques. Slowly but surely, the style began to gain traction as more and more students joined the bandwagon. The trend was mostly fueled by the endless admiration for Ariana Grande and her extraordinary style, which girls across campus wanted to recreate. Step 2: Angela's transformation Angela, a relatively average girl in terms of popularity, took on the challenge of replicating the Ariana Grande look more intensively than anyone else. She spent hours researching different makeup tutorials and carefully studying Ariana's fashion choices. With her naturally similar facial features, it wasn't long before Angela emerged as the perfect embodiment of the pop icon, further popularizing the trend and captivating the attention of both her peers and teachers. Step 3: The shift in popularity As Angela's transformation became more noticeable, she started receiving compliments and admiration from students and even teachers. This newfound attention significantly boosted her self-confidence and social standing. She began hanging out with a more popular crowd, and as a result, her friendship with Betty—once her best friend—started fading. Step 4: The growing divide between Angela and Betty Betty, who had always been a popular girl at school, could not keep up with the Ariana Grande trend. Her attempts to replicate the style were futile, making her feel increasingly left out of the new social circle. The growing distance between her and Angela eventually led to both emotional and social consequences: Betty's jealousy and insecurity increased, and she found herself losing friends to the ever-growing \\"Ariana\\" fan club. Step 5: The impact on the school's social landscape The Ariana Grande trend elevated Angela's social status and reshaped the school's popularity hierarchy. Cliques formed around those who could pull off the Ariana look best, leaving others like Betty feeling alienated or rejected. The once-harmonious school environment slowly turned into a battleground of competition, with people constantly vying for attention and trying to outdo each other in terms of style — with Angela as their ultimate inspiration. In conclusion, the Ariana Grande look created a seismic shift in the social dynamic of the school. Angela's successful transformation into an Ariana doppelgänger led to the disruption of friendships, a new hierarchy based on style and appearance, and a culture of emulation and competition among students. While this change awarded Angela fame and acclaim, it also brought along less desirable consequences, as friendships became collateral damage in the pursuit of popularity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why: 1. Structure: The sentence follows the rules of English syntax, which dictate the ordering of words in a grammatically correct sentence. In this case, the sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, which is the standard structure in English. The subject is \\"The tigers\\", the verb is \\"hunt\\", and the object is \\"prey\\". 2. Vocabulary: The sentence uses standard English vocabulary that is easily understood by English speakers. The words \\"tigers\\", \\"hunt\\", \\"prey\\", and \\"night\\" are all easily recognizable as English words, and their meanings are clear within the context of the sentence. 3. Clarity: The meaning of the sentence is clear and can be easily understood. It communicates that the tigers carry out the action of hunting prey during the nighttime. There is no ambiguity or confusion in the message being conveyed. 4. Completeness: The sentence is complete and does not leave the reader wondering about any missing information. It provides enough information about the subject, verb, and object to create a coherent idea. 5. Tense and Agreement: The verb \\"hunt\\" is in the present tense, which is appropriate because the sentence is describing a general fact about the activities of tigers. Furthermore, the subject \\"tigers\\" agrees with the verb \\"hunt\\" in this case, as both of them are plural in form. This agreement is essential for linguistic acceptability.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down each statement and think step by step. Premise: \\"But while creativity may exist, it doesn't necessarily exist over and over again.\\" This statement acknowledges the existence of creativity, but suggests that it might not be a recurring phenomenon. Hypothesis: \\"Creativity exists over and over again throughout time.\\" This statement claims that creativity is indeed a recurring phenomenon that happens repeatedly across time. Now, considering the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: Step 1: Identify if the statements are in agreement or disagreement. The premise and the hypothesis disagree with each other, as one suggests creativity might not be recurring, while the other asserts that it is. Step 2: Determine if one statement contradicts or negates the other. The premise suggests that the recurrence of creativity is uncertain (\\"doesn't necessarily exist over and over again\\"), while the hypothesis declares that it does. They have conflicting viewpoints but the premise does not completely dismiss the possibility of the recurring creativity. Step 3: Assess whether one statement can support the other as true. Since the premise leaves room for doubt regarding the recurrence of creativity, it doesn't necessarily invalidate the hypothesis, but it also doesn't support it. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true. The premise and hypothesis have opposing viewpoints, and the premise does not provide enough evidence or foundation for the hypothesis to be proven true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Analyze the first sentence In the sentence \\"Blow on the soup to cool it down,\\" \\"blow\\" serves as a verb meaning to exhale air gently through the lips. The purpose of blowing in this context is to reduce the temperature of the soup. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence In the sentence \\"The fuse blew,\\" \\"blew\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"blow.\\" Here, it means a sudden and powerful release of energy caused by an electrical overload, resulting in the failure of the fuse. The purpose of blowing in this context is to protect the electrical circuit by stopping the current when it becomes excessive. Step 3: Compare the meanings and contexts of the two sentences In the first sentence, \\"blow\\" means to exhale air gently to cool something down. In the second sentence, \\"blow\\" refers to a sudden release of energy causing a fuse to fail. The meanings are different.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Science/Tech.","completion":"(2). Sports. Tiger Woods, one of the most accomplished and influential golfers in the history of the sport, has expressed his desire to play a more substantial role in the US Ryder Cup team's future decision-making process. Woods, along with the rest of the American team, faced difficulties during the biennial Ryder Cup event held earlier this month. The Ryder Cup is a prestigious golf competition that takes place every two years, pitting the best players from the United States against those from Europe. In recent years, the European team has dominated the event, leading to questions regarding the performance of the US team and the decisions made by its leadership. Tiger Woods' desire to have more say in the team's future stems from his extensive experience and success in the sport. Woods has secured 15 major championships during his career, and remains a leading figure in golf even as he has faced personal and physical challenges off the course. Woods has played in eight Ryder Cups thus far, and his perspective could provide valuable insight into building a successful strategy as the US team looks to contend with the European powerhouse in upcoming competitions. In order for Woods to have a greater influence on the US Ryder Cup team's decision-making, he could consider several paths. One possibility could be working toward a role within the team's management structure, such as becoming a vice-captain or eventually taking on the role of captain. This would afford him a more direct channel of communication with the players and facilitate his involvement in roster and strategy decisions. Alternatively, Woods could also become a mentor or advisor to both the team's players and the captain. His wealth of experience, knowledge of the game, and status as a respected figure in golf could provide the US team with valuable guidance and motivation. Woods' involvement in these capacities could propel the team toward improved performance and greater accomplishments in future Ryder Cup events. In conclusion, the topic is focused on the realm of sports, specifically golf, and highlights Tiger Woods' aspirations to impact future US Ryder Cup team decisions. Woods has a wealth of experience that could aid the decision-making process as the team looks to improve their performance against European golfers. By playing an active role in team management or serving as a mentor and advisor, Woods could use his influence and expertise to help shape the US Ryder Cup team's future success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Napalm Death are a British extreme metal band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, England, in 1981. While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band's career since 1992's Utopia Banished, although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado as the replacement of one-time guitarist Bill Steer; following Pintado's departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him. Napalm Death are credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of incomprehensible growls, or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, fast tempos, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. With the departure of Broadrick and Bullen, the band had to look for new members. Guitarist Bill Steer played in a band based in Liverpool, called Carcass and given the affinity between the bands, he joined Napalm Death while still playing an active role in Carcass. The band asked a friend, Coventrian (Lee Dorrian), to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the band (he had organised a number of concerts for the band), even though he had never been in a band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the Scum LP at Rich Bitch studios in May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records. Bill Steer also came third place on Decibel Magazine's \\"Top 20 Death Metal guitarists of all time.\\" The band promptly lost another member just after they undertook a short tour after the release of Scum. Jim Whiteley left the group (and subsequently joined Weston-Super-Mare based band Ripcord with whom the aforementioned tour had been shared) and Shane Embury (former drummer of Unseen Terror) moved to bass. The band then appeared on two compilation records ('North Atlantic Noise Attack' and the 'Pathological Compilation'), recorded two Peel sessions and a split 7\\" with Japanese band S.O.B. They also returned to Rich Bitch studio once more and recorded their second album: From Enslavement to Obliteration. A follow-up release to \\"Enslavement...\\" came in the form of the six song 12\\" EP \\"Mentally Murdered\\", which was to be the last recording with the Harris/Steer/Dorian/Embury line-up. This EP was recorded at the Slaughterhouse Studios and took on a slightly different sound, blending grindcore with death metal. Following the release, Napalm Death were featured on national television in the United Kingdom in a heavy metal special by Arena (BBC 2). The band continued to tour, but as soon as they came back home from Japan, in July 1989, Steer and Dorrian left the band: Steer decided to dedicate himself full-time to Carcass, while Dorrian formed the doom metal group Cathedral. The group recruited Jesse Pintado (ex-Terrorizer) on guitar and Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway (ex-Benediction) as vocalist. This line-up took part in the Grindcrusher tour organised by Earache Records and featuring fellow label-mates Carcass, Bolt Thrower and Morbid Angel. The group recruited Mitch Harris (ex-Righteous Pigs) as second guitarist after the tour.

Brett wanted to properly clean up Neil's blonde dyed hair so","completion":"Brett studied various hair care techniques and products to achieve the best results. He did some research online about the most effective ways to help restore Neil's hair health, color, and texture without damaging it further. Brett took detailed notes and prepared a list of the necessary supplies: sulfate-free shampoo, a deep conditioner, clarifying shampoo, a wide-tooth comb, a soft towel, and a hair mask containing hydrating and restorative ingredients. Once he was ready, he invited Neil to his apartment for a hair intervention. Neil, a bit skeptical, reluctantly agreed, knowing that his hair needed help after the unsuccessful dye job left it dull, tangled, and dry. Once Neil arrived, Brett shared his research findings and laid out the plan to rejuvenate Neil's hair. The first step involved washing the hair with the sulfate-free shampoo, as sulfates could further strip and damage the hair. They went to the bathroom, and after having Neil lean over the tub, Brett gently massaged the shampoo into his hair, being sure to distribute it evenly and carefully. After a thorough rinse, Brett moved onto the second step, which was using a deep conditioner. He applied a generous amount of the conditioner to Neil's hair while making sure to avoid the roots. As the conditioner worked its magic, Brett gently went through Neil's hair with the wide-tooth comb to untangle any knots and equally distribute the product. He advised Neil to let the conditioner sit for a few minutes to allow for maximum absorption. While they waited, Brett and Neil discussed various hair care tips and tricks to maintain healthy hair, like minimizing heat styling and using silk pillowcases to reduce friction and breakage during the night. After the conditioner had done its job of moisturizing and repairing Neil's hair, Brett rinsed it out with lukewarm water, making sure not to leave any residue behind. The next step involved using the clarifying shampoo to remove any remaining dye and product build-up from Neil's hair. Brett massaged this shampoo into Neil's hair much like the sulfate-free shampoo, making sure to create a rich lather. After rinsing twice, he noticed a considerable improvement in the hair's brightness and clarity. Finally, the last step in the process was to apply the hair mask. Since Neil's hair was slightly damp, Brett deemed it perfect for the mask as the hair shaft would be open, allowing the ingredients to penetrate deeply. He applied the mask, focusing on the mid-lengths to the ends of Neil's hair as these parts required the most hydration. He combed Neil's hair to ensure even distribution and advised him to let the mask sit for at least 15 minutes. As they waited, Brett provided additional recommendations, like getting a trim to remove split ends and scheduling regular deep-conditioning treatments to maintain hair health. Once the 15 minutes were up, Brett rinsed the mask out of Neil's hair with cool water to close the hair cuticle and lock in moisture. When they were done, Neil examined his hair in the mirror. In just a few hours, his hair had drastically improved in appearance and felt much healthier. It was significantly softer, shinier, and more manageable than it had been in a long time. Neil thanked Brett profusely for his help, promising to heed his advice and properly care for his hair going forward. Brett, satisfied with the outcome, was glad he could help his friend. Not only had they managed to improve the appearance and health of Neil's hair, but they had also strengthened their friendship through the experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Obama Parries With House GOP on Budget, Immigration Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call Obama arrives at the Capitol for a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, accompanied by House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving. President Barack Obama continued his push for a grand bargain, an immigration overhaul and the rest of his agenda in a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, but GOP leaders immediately shut the door on any compromises that would include new taxes. Obama appealed to Republicans to come to the table on a bipartisan budget package — saying he’s willing to back 2 in spending cuts for every 1 in tax revenue — and he argued that reaching agreement on immigration would benefit them politically. But he also told them balancing the budget over the next 10 years is not on his priority list. Republicans thanked the president for the rare sojourn to the Capitol and said they hoped that this would start a new dialogue with the president on a range of issues. But many lawmakers said deep suspicions and divisions remain. GOP leaders immediately held a news conference where they praised the president’s visiting but reiterated their opposition to his tax demands. “If the president wants to let our unwillingness to raise taxes get in the way, then we are not gonna be able to set differences aside and focus on what we agree on,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said. Cantor suggested that there are “low-hanging fruit” among spending cuts that both sides support. And Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said he’s heard the president before but that it was good for his members to hear it. “Republicans want to balance the budget, the president doesn’t. Republicans want to solve our long-term debt problem. The president doesn’t. We want to unlock our energy resources to put more Americans back to work. The president doesn’t. But, having said that, today was a good start, and I hope that these kind of discussions can continue,” he said. Obama, members said, talked about areas where he was willing to trim entitlements, including adopting a stingier measure of inflation and means-testing Medicare — but he explicitly tied those proposals to new revenue. Or, in the words of Boehner, he threatened to hold cuts “hostage.” “He does not want balance the budget in 10 years and he wants tax increases and he wants new spending, but other than that we are close,” quipped Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. Obama also faced tough questioning on the sequester-related closing of White House public tours — the president pointed the finger at the Secret Service, causing an audible gasp in the audience. When the president announced in the middle of the meeting that white smoke had been seen at the Vatican — signifying a new pope — Rep. Billy Long of Missouri seized the occasion. “Billy just blurted out, as Billy does, ‘Does that mean we’ll have tours at the White House?’ and it broke the place up and even the president laughed at that,” Nebraska’s Lee Terry said. Obama reportedly replied that tours of the Vatican were still available. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Disqus ||||| President Barack Obama tangled with House Republicans for more than an hour Wednesday, answering questions on topics ranging from whether the White House spends too much time campaigning to how serious the administration is about slashing the nation’s deficit. Republicans focused on political issues — quizzing Obama on why his White House stopped giving tours after the sequester took effect. But the House GOP also delved into policy, where Republicans heard Obama say he doesn’t want to balance the budget in 10 years. That’s the challenge issued by Rep. Paul Ryan in the GOP budget unveiled on Tuesday. Text Size - + reset BTC: Obama's tax problem Paul Ryan questions Obama's 'charm offensive' It was the first opportunity House Republicans had in nearly two years to directly confront Obama, a president that many of them were elected by lambasting, and all of them tried to defeat in 2012. The exchange — which was serious, but interspersed with a few jokes — allowed the GOP lawmakers to vent on a range of concerns, including the time they think Obama spends campaigning against them. They’re concerned that Obama’s not committed to lowering the deficit and whether the president’s so-called “charm offensive” in reaching out to lawmakers to strike a grand bargain on the deficit is sincere. Obama shook hands and answered private questions after the session, a source said. The meeting was part of an aggressive outreach effort by the president to Hill lawmakers to try and find common ground on the deficit. On Tuesday, Obama met with Senate Democrats, and on Thursday, he will meet with Senate Republicans and House Democrats. Obama met with Senate Democrats on the Hill on Tuesday. A White House official called the meeting a “good, substantive exchange” and said Obama “enjoyed the conversation.”The aide said that the two parties didn’t need to agree on everything to compromise on some things. “The President handled a variety of questions on a range of topics from the members and reinforced his strong desire, especially now that the election is over, to find bipartisan common ground on a range of legislative priorities,” the aide said. The president heard from old and new faces. None of the issues that surfaced, though, were a complete surprise. Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) — the Republican Policy Committee chairman — brought up a familiar hobby-horse for House Republicans: that Obama is always campaigning. He asked about Organizing for Action’s (OFA) meeting. He complained that Obama called Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) before Boehner on election night. Obama said that wasn’t true and that he had called Boehner, but Boehner had gone to sleep, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The speaker said the president was right, the source said. Lankford argued that Obama is too focused on defeating House Republicans instead of “saving the next generation” from debt problems. He then mentioned Bill Clinton working successfully to balance the budget and asked if he’d commit to balancing the budget in 10 years, as Ryan’s budget dictates. “OFA is organized around issues rather than 2014,” Obama said in a lengthy, 10-minute answer to Lankford, according to a source inside the meeting. ||||| House Republicans peppered President Obama with pointed questions on the budget, White House tours and the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline during an hourlong meeting Wednesday that yielded no major breakthroughs between the two divided parties. While the exchanges during Obama’s first meeting in nearly two years with his chief opponents on Capitol Hill were polite, they only underscored the wide ideological gulf between the reelected Democratic president and the Republican House majority. “It didn’t change anything at all. He didn’t offer anything new,” said Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), a close ally of Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerTrump’s new weapon? The bully pulpit President-elect Trump: Please drain the student loan swamp GOP leaders face crunch in Trump's first 100 days MORE (R-Ohio). ADVERTISEMENT Obama spent a majority of the meeting taking questions from members hand-picked by the Republican leadership. The topics ranged from the nation’s fiscal impasse to immigration, guns, cybersecurity, Israel, Keystone and the cancellation of White House tours due to sequestration spending cuts. The president told lawmakers he believed they had “about a nine-month window” to act on major budget priorities like overhauling the tax code, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. On immigration, Obama spoke in frank political terms and sought to dispel Republican suspicions that he would rather see comprehensive legislation fail so he can use the issue as a hammer on the GOP in 2014. A victory on immigration, he told the lawmakers, would help Republicans more than it would help Democrats in 2014. But, Cole quoted Obama as saying, “it needs to happen, and I want to work toward it.” In a press conference afterward, Boehner John BoehnerTrump’s new weapon? The bully pulpit President-elect Trump: Please drain the student loan swamp GOP leaders face crunch in Trump's first 100 days MORE thanked the president for coming, and described the meeting in classic Washington vernacular. “I think that we had a very frank and candid exchange of ideas and frankly I think it was productive,” he said. Yet when asked what specifically came out of the meeting that was positive, the Speaker referred only to a tone that he called “respectful” and “very good.” Boehner, who has often served as a conduit between the White House and his conference, said it was good for Republican lawmakers to hear from the president directly, even if the message was familiar. “I heard what the president had to say. I’ve heard it before,” he said. “I thought it was good for all of our members to hear it, so they can have an understanding of where’s he’s coming from. We’ve got big problems in this country that need to be addressed. We’re willing to get them addressed. I hope the president continues his outreach.” About the only news that Obama brought to House Republicans, multiple lawmakers said, was the announcement that there was a new pope. While billions outside the closed-door meeting learned through television about the historic selection, House Republicans learned from the president. There’s “white smoke at the Vatican. We don’t know a name,” Obama told the members after receiving a message. “Does that mean you’ll open up the White House for tours?,” asked Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.). Over the laughter of the attendees, Obama chuckled. “No, but it means they’ll open the Vatican,” he said. Leaving the meeting, a smiling Obama spoke briefly of the election of a pope, saying “we look forward to hearing about it.” Of the meeting itself, Obama was terse. “It was good. I enjoyed it,” he told reporters. “It was useful.” Obama earned a standing ovation from Republicans when he entered the meeting, the second of four sessions the president is having on Capitol Hill this week with House and Senate Republicans and Democrats, and there was only one moment of testiness, according to a number of GOP lawmakers in the room. Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, asked why Obama ended the White House tours in light of the sequester, instead of the annual Christmas party or congressional picnic. The president pointed blame at the Secret Service, saying they didn’t want to have to furlough staff and opted instead to cut non-essential tasks. Members responded with “groans in disbelief,” said one Republican, prompting Obama to caution: “Now, now, let’s be respectful.” “In fairness, the president said he’s looking into ways to get school groups in, and that would take less [security personnel] because you could check them in advance,” a separate lawmaker conceded, noting that it takes a lot of Secret Service to check in the dozens of tourists who take tours of the White House. The most significant point of contention, however, remained the central impasse that has divided the White House and congressional Republicans for more than two years: the federal budget. Under the leadership of Rep. Paul Ryan Paul RyanWhy the GOP shouldn't get too cocky after winning in November Trump eyes House members for Cabinet jobs Trump’s new weapon? The bully pulpit MORE (R-Wis.), House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a budget resolution that eliminates the federal deficit within a decade through steep spending cuts and entitlement reforms. Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), asking the first question of Obama, sought a commitment from the president for a 10-year balanced budget. Obama said no. “The president tactfully said ‘That’s not my priority, my priority is not slowing the recovery down and the long-term economic health of the country,’ ” Rogers said. Obama instead talked about balancing the budget “in principle,” lawmakers said, meaning eliminating all deficits except for payments of interest on the debt. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said the president’s definition of a budget that balances “in principle” is like “telling a family that your budget balances without counting the interest on your credit card debt or your mortgage.” “It matters,” Walden said. Lawmakers also pressed Obama on the approval of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline from Canada, a long-standing priority for Republicans who argue its construction would expand U.S. energy and create jobs. Obama said a decision will arrive soon, but lawmakers emerged split over whether or not he suggested that he’s leaning toward approval. Obama lingered after the meeting to shake hands and chat privately with members. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry Jeff FortenberryWHIP LIST: Republicans breaking with Trump Pence rallies GOP before final stretch Pence to House GOP: Trump needs your help MORE (R-Neb.) said he approached Obama afterward and asked the president “about conscience rights,” a reference to the administration’s decision to require most employers to cover birth control for their workers — something Fortenberry has fought tooth and nail. “I did want to raise this because this is a deep concern for some of us,” Fortenberry said. He asked Obama “if there’s an opening to reconsider the administration’s position.” Fortenberry did not reveal Obama’s response, but said he felt as if Obama took his concerns seriously. Republicans told Obama he is welcome to address their conference “anytime,” although some doubted the usefulness of the discussion, saying it could improve — but not fix — the deficit of trust between the two sides.

Michele Bachmann Michele BachmannMichele Bachmann on Trump victory: ‘God did this’ The right-wing wants a revolution, and we had better pay attention Bachmann: Trump, GOP feud isn't a 'civil war' MORE (R-Minn.), who ran to unseat Obama in 2012, said the president “used a lot of big, fluffy generalities.” “He called for bipartisanship as long as we agree with him and his positions,” she said. “He continually restated the obvious over and over. He said he was willing to do hard things, and he never said what those hard things were.” Cole, however, said he thought members came out of the meeting “with a higher opinion of Obama than going into the meeting.” “We’ll see what comes of it. That’s what matters,” said Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. “The question is, is this just the latest chapter in the never-ending campaign?” — Published at 2:28 p.m. and updated at 8:36 p.m. ||||| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Talk about white smoke: I am told, by Republican sources, that President Obama got standing ovations at the beginning and end of his meeting today with House Republicans on Capitol Hill - his first such meeting in four years.

On entitlement reform, he made it clear he was willing to push Democrats to make tough cuts but only if Republicans agreed to higher tax revenues. He also mentioned the strong bi-partisan commitment to Israel, which he will visit next week. He was asked about eight questions, including these: Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma accused Obama of being too focused on defeating Republicans and asked, \\"Can we agree that we need to get to a balanced budget in 10 years?\\" The president responded by saying that domestic spending had already been cut deeply, and that balancing the budget too quickly would hurt the economy. Rep. Candace Miller of Michigan asked about the cancellation of White House tours. The president said it was a Secret Service decision. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana asked about offshore oil drilling and the Keystone pipeline. The president said there were broad areas of agreement on energy, but that it was important to have a broader energy policy beyond fossil fuels. He said a decision on the Keystone pipeline would be coming \\"soon.\\" Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, asked if Obama and Republicans agreed on some entitlement reforms (specifically, means-testing for Medicare and reducing annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security), why couldn't those things be done now? The president said he would agree to those reforms only if Republicans agreed to raise tax revenues by closing loopholes, because we have to ask \\"everybody to sacrifice.\\" Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois, who served with Obama in the Illinois state legislature, brought up the fiscal mess in Illinois and said Republicans were worried that Obama's policies would cause the same thing to happen here. Obama said the budget mess in Illinois was a bipartisan mess. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia brought up the lack of trust between Republicans and the White House, and said the delay on the White House budget seemed politically motivated. Obama insisted the delay was not political: \\"I am done with campaigns,\\" he said. \\"I am not running for re-election.\\" The president hit that theme several times during the meeting. Several of the questioners brought up the lack of trust and pointed to the fact that the president would be meeting tonight on behalf of his grassroots group Organizing for Action, raising money, as Roskam put it, \\"to thin our herd.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama ’s meeting with a restive and resistant House Republican majority on Wednesday underscored their deep divisions over fiscal policy as both sides acknowledged that an overarching budget compromise was in doubt despite a new push by the White House. One day after Republicans rolled out a detailed proposal aimed at eliminating the federal deficit through steep cuts and repealing many of the president’s accomplishments, Mr. Obama told them pointedly in a rare visit that their highest fiscal priority was not his. “Our biggest problems in the next 10 years are not deficits,” the president said, according to accounts from the meeting, bluntly rejecting an idea that has become Republican fiscal dogma. That left many Republicans, who are resisting the president’s calls to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, wondering where they could find room for compromise. “Well, he doesn’t want to balance the budget in 10 years, and he wants tax increases, and he wants new spending,” Representative Darrell Issa of California said as he left the meeting early. “But other than that, we’re close.” The hourlong discussion at the Capitol, and the release of a new budget by Senate Democrats on Wednesday that adds 100 billion in new stimulus spending and would impose higher taxes on large corporations and wealthy Americans, illustrated anew just how difficult it will be to resolve the issues that have split the Congress for years and created a perpetual cycle of deadline-driven short-term fiscal policy. Given the gap in the budget approaches, the president conceded as much in an interview with ABC News that ran on Wednesday before he went to the Capitol for the second consecutive day. “Ultimately, it may be that the differences are just too wide,” said Mr. Obama, who will meet Thursday with Senate Republicans and House Democrats. “It may be that ideologically, if their position is, ‘We can’t do any revenue,’ or, ‘We can only do revenue if we gut Medicare or gut Social Security or gut Medicaid,’ if that’s the position, then we’re probably not going to be able to get a deal.” While the White House and Republicans characterized Wednesday’s discussion as a cordial first step in what they hope will be a continuing dialogue, those who attended were frank about the prospects for compromise. “The president seemed to say, ‘If we’re going to do the areas we agree on, you have to also do some of mine,’ ” said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, bristling at Mr. Obama’s suggestion. “If we can find the areas we agree on, why can’t we just do those?” The problem in coming together on areas of agreement is that there are so few. Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on the fundamental, underlying problem with the country’s fiscal governance. Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama, noting that the government has long operated with deep deficits, do not see a need for a balanced budget as long as spending is kept in check. Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat and Senate Budget Committee chairwoman who outlined her budget on Wednesday, summed up her party’s objections to Republican austerity measures, which Democrats have said rob the country of needed investment. “Deficit reduction at the expense of economic growth is doomed to failure,” she said. Under their budget, Senate Democrats would have the government running a deficit of nearly 600 billion in 10 years. In another sign of just how different the parties’ priorities are, just before Mr. Obama arrived to meet with House Republicans, the Senate rejected a Republican effort to cut off financing for the president’s signature health care overhaul in a party-line vote. Other issues surfaced in Wednesday’s talks that only further highlighted the partisan gulf. Republicans vented their frustration that the president always seemed to be in campaign mode, questioning why he would speak to Organizing for Action, a nonprofit that supports his priorities, on the same day he visited them. They pushed him to approve the Keystone oil pipeline and to reopen the White House for tours. Representative Candice S. Miller of Michigan told him that if he wanted to save on expenses, he should cancel the White House picnics and Christmas parties held for members of Congress instead. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"President Barack Obama met with House Republicans to discuss budget, immigration, and other issues on his agenda.

What may happen to a parent if they get a nanny ?","completion":"If a parent decides to get a nanny, several outcomes may occur. 1. Initial assessment: First, the parent needs to analyze their specific requirements and preferences. They may choose between live-in or live-out nannies, full-time or part-time assistance, and evaluate their budget constraints. 2. Searching for a nanny: The parent will have to begin the process of searching for a suitable nanny, either through a reputable agency, online platform, or through personal connections. 3. Screening and interviewing: This step is crucial for ensuring the security and well-being of the family. Parents need to conduct thorough background checks, verify references, and hold multiple interviews to assess the nanny's qualifications, experience, and personality. 4. Contract agreement: Once a suitable candidate is identified, the parent needs to negotiate terms of employment, including working hours, salary, holidays, and any other relevant details. A written contract would legally bind both parties and protect their rights. 5. Building trust and rapport: The parent and nanny relationship needs to develop trust and rapport since the nanny will be taking care of the children. Regular communication between the parent and the nanny will be essential in building a strong, professional relationship. 6. Adjusting to new routines: As the nanny enters the home, both the family and the nanny will need time to adjust to the new dynamics. The children might take a while to feel comfortable with their new caregiver during the transition. 7. Improved family life balance: With a nanny in place, parents will have more time for work, self-care, and social engagements while being confident that their children are in safe hands. The nanny’s presence can reduce stress and create a more harmonious atmosphere within the home. 8. Potential challenges: Hiring a nanny may come with some challenges including possible conflicts of opinions on child rearing or personality clashes, and potential turnover if the nanny leaves the job. To manage these challenges, parents should maintain open communication and address any concerns promptly. In summary, if a parent decides to get a nanny, they need to follow a sequential process of assessing needs, searching, interviewing, forming a contract, building trust, adjusting to routines, and managing potential challenges.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Question: Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that _ .

Q: Passage: The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a \\"European Council\\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962.

Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).

This article: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece?, what is it ?","completion":"The last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Monteverdi piece is Carter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A bitter Jacqueline follows them to Egypt, appearing wherever they go. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is also on holiday in Egypt. While staying in the same hotel as the newlyweds, he is approached by Linnet Doyle who is getting tired of Jacqueline's harassment. Poirot doesn't accept the job, as he believes that Jacqueline has been treated shamefully by Linnet and Simon. He nevertheless tries to warn Jacqueline against pursuing the Doyles any further. She ignores his warning and joins their cruise on the river Nile. Linnet Doyle comments that she is \\"surrounded by enemies\\" on the cruise, as some of the other travellers are also known to her.

Movie title: Troy Context: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Here is a goal: Animal trainer How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Becoming an animal trainer involves a variety of steps, each with its own set of skills and knowledge. In broad strokes, here is a detailed process that can guide someone to accomplish the goal of becoming an animal trainer. 1. **Research the Profession**: Understand what being an animal trainer entails. Research the different types of legal requirements in your location. Consider the daily tasks, scheduling, client interaction, animal behavior management, and overarching responsibilities associated with the profession. Look into job outlook, average salary, and job growth predictions too. Being an animal trainer can give you the opportunity to work in a variety of settings, including zoos, aquariums, movie sets, or private homes. 2. **Educational Requirements**: While a high school diploma or an equivalent is often a minimum educational requirement, having a bachelor's degree in biology, animal behaviour, or a similar field will significantly improve your candidacy. Degree programs often offer coursework in areas like wildlife studies, animal behaviour, and animal nutrition. 3. **Get Experience with Animals**: Experience is crucial in this line of work. Volunteer or work in places where you could work with animals like veterinary clinics, animal shelters, farms, stables, or boarding kennels. This experience can provide you with practical knowledge about animal habits, behavior and care requirements. 4. **Obtain Necessary Certification**: Depending on where you live and the specific type of animal you want to train, you may need to be certified. For example, to become a pet dog trainer, you may pursue certification through organizations like the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or the Association of Professional Dog Trainers. These certifications usually involve coursework, exams, and sometimes practical assessments or internships. 5. **Specialize**: Figure out what type of animal trainer you want to be. This might include dogs, cats, horses, birds, marine animals, and more. Each of these animals require different kinds of knowledge and techniques for training. Additionally, some specialize in specific areas such as obedience, agility, hunting, service dogs, therapy animals, or animal acting. 6. **Get a Job as an Animal Trainer**: Look for job postings in local classifieds, online employment websites, animal organizations and professional trainer associations. As a start, you might work as an assistant to a seasoned trainer where you can learn hands-on training techniques. 7. **Develop Your Skills**: Keep learning, improving, updating and practicing your skills. Attend seminars, workshops and conferences, read relevant literature, and stay updated with the latest research in animal behavior. Building a strong network with other professionals in your field can also present opportunities for continual learning and professional growth. 8. **Start Your Own Business or Freelance**: After gaining some experience, you might consider starting your own animal training business or providing freelance animal training services. This would require additional skills in business, marketing, and customer service. Remember, patience, compassion, and solid communication skills are also key qualities that will help you succeed as an animal trainer. It is a rewarding career where you get to strengthen the bond between humans and animals and ensure the welfare of animals.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow. I liked the original Matrix a great deal. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was fairly well paced, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights. In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and by night, brave hacker. Eventually, he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine, or does he go back to the safe, forgettable world he started in. Interestingly, he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions, life rather sucks. He has his girl by his side and his boon companions, but he eats processed swill, dresses in sweats, and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery. Still, the truth makes him free. At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the \\"what if it were me\\" questions raised in the viewer's mind. What if _I_ were capable of the impossible? What if I were \\"The One\\". It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of, with a cool title like that. Further, agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as merciless. At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie, and it does so with such lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes. When the dialog is at a fifth grade level, with various long words dropped in randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. My short list of characterization failures: The Oracle goes from mildly helpful, if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason. Major \\"personalities\\" of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster, for example, was a cute idea, but just not that interesting a character. Fishburne loses his \\"advisor\\" role, and gets nothing to replace it with. The people of Zion are not particularly likable, nor would you really _want_ them running the world. Special effects problems: The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable. In The Matrix, you felt Neo could lose, and that he had to become something greater in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game. The fight on the freeway looked quite fake, and not that interesting. Pacing problems. As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were interminable. The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people pictured, nor did we care. Whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business. It meandered, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacing killer. The creator's speech could have been done in a tenth the time, and with more peril as \\"Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix. There are now too many people who do not believe; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it. Further, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, let alone these others. You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix.\\" Instead, we got a long, drawn out bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript, and try breaking down the sentences. Each one is too long by several clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. So, in summary, not worth seeing. I have seen the third one, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey. The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were \\"deep\\" should go see some truly deep movies. Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and perhaps a bit of philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it is hard to stomach. Scott Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? pick from the following.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: When many of us have a little cash to invest, we might buy a mutual fund or a stock â if we donât blow it on the latest tech gadget. Not the truly wealthy, however. They often put their money in property, art, businesses and other investments that the rest of us can only dream of owning. How this rarified group uses their cash differentiates them from the rest of us â and keeps them in the black. Take Joshua Coleman, for example. When his family sold their Chicago-based telecom company for 400m in 2004, they didnât run out and buy something extravagant. Instead, they began seeking advice on ways to save their newfound riches and help them grow. Their quest sparked an idea for Coleman, now 27. In 2011, he launched Momentum Advanced Planning â a firm that connects people to tax, legal and wealth experts. If the business one day sells, he could see a big return, just like his familyâs first business. If you think that starting a business is an odd way to invest your money, then you probably arenât among the ultra-wealthy. People who have at least 30m in assets â dubbed ultra high net-worth â invest in stocks and bonds, but they also grow their money by buying companies and investing in unusual securities, such as airline leasing funds. They also own art and cars that they hope will appreciate in value. âItâs called alpha risk,â said Coleman. âItâs this kind of stuff where there can be a lot of upside.â As for the downside, many of these investments are riskier than traditional investments, so thereâs a higher chance of losing a large chunk of change. As well, theyâre far less liquid than stocks and it could talk months or years for the wealthy to get their money out of an investment. Even if you donât have millions to invest, though, you can learn a thing or two about how the rich reap returns and apply it your own portfolios.

The premise and the hypothesis present two different scenarios involving two people near a body of water. There are a few key differences between these two statements that indicate that they do not directly confirm or deny the truth of one another. 1. Location: In the premise, the two people are crossing the river by walking on the rocks. This indicates that the location is a river, where there are rocks present to provide a path for crossing. In the hypothesis, the two people are playing in the waves at the beach. This scenario takes place at a beach, which is a different location compared to a river. 2. Activity: The premise describes an action of crossing the river, presumably to get from one side of the river to the other. Walking on the rocks implies that the individuals are attempting to avoid getting wet and navigating the river safely. In the hypothesis, the two people are playing in the waves, which suggests that they are likely engaged in recreational activities, possibly splashing in the water, swimming, or engaging in water sports. The activities in these two scenarios are quite different from one another. 3. Interaction with water: The premise implies that the two people are trying to avoid getting wet by walking on the rocks as they cross the river. In contrast, the hypothesis has them immersed in the water and actively playing in the waves at the beach, which indicates that they are not avoiding getting wet and are likely to be enjoying the water. Given these differences, the premise does not provide any information about the truth of the hypothesis. It does not confirm or deny that the two people are playing in the waves at the beach. It is possible that the two people cross the river by walking on the rocks at one point and later play in the waves at the beach, or they could be two entirely separate instances with different people or circumstances.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: The New York Times In this age of information overload, information providers and social networks are competing to provide just the highlights that you want, when you want them. News outlets send alerts with breaking news and editors’ picks of top stories. Twitter curates top tweets, organized by subject, into collections it calls Moments. Weather apps warn you of rain minutes before the droplets arrive. Now Facebook, whose popular social network uses an inscrutable algorithm to predict which posts from friends and organizations you most want to see, is trying to corral the highlights and bulletins you receive from other services into one place. On Wednesday, it introduced a new iPhone app called Notify that it says will deliver “timely notifications about the things that matter to you, from the sources you love, all in one place.” The Notify app is separate from the main Facebook service, although users must have a Facebook account to log in. Notify’s primary purpose is to let you sort through and choose to receive mobile-device notifications from various news and information sources on specific topics. If you want final scores or live updates from a San Francisco 49ers games, for example, Fox Sports lets you sign up for those. Dying to know what the cover stories are in the latest issue of Vogue? Those, too, are available as alerts. There is even a daily meditation from Headspace. The notifications are delivered to your iPhone just like any other notification, meaning they show up on some of the most valuable real estate on today’s smartphones: the lock screen that appears when a phone has been idle for a while. The app also shows users all of their recent and saved notifications. “This is a central place you can go where you can build a notification experience that works for you,” Julian Gutman, the Notify product manager, said in an interview. There are about 70 content partners participating, including big broadcasters, like ABC and Fox News; lifestyle publications like Bon Appétit and Thrillist; business news outlets like Bloomberg and MarketWatch; The Weather Channel; and the daily deals site Groupon. The New York Times is also a partner. In some cases, you can customize the alerts by your location, for things like weather or local news. Facebook envisions adding partners, including commercial partners like retailers, as it works out the kinks in the service, which initially will be available only in the United States. Currently, advertisements cannot be sent as notifications, although it is easy to imagine how Facebook could eventually slip in some commercials, as it does with its Instagram photo-sharing service or the news feed in its core social network. Facebook’s other recent initiative to court content creators, called Instant Articles, hosts articles on its social network to speed them up. Notify is more traditional — the partner organizations write the notification text and add a link to a mobile website of their choosing. The idea of pushing information to Internet users, instead of asking them to pull up information through a browser or an app, has been around since the early days of the Internet. PointCast, for example, offered a push information service that was popular in 1996 and 1997, back when most Internet users were on dial-up connections. Many modern apps use push notifications heavily, including the recommendation service Foursquare and Facebook itself. More recently, the introduction of the Apple Watch spurred a new round of interest in notifications as a canvas unto themselves, instead of as just a way to alert people to content in other apps. Niche apps like Yo and IFTTT use notifications at the core of their services. Apple and Google are also building more notifications into their smartphone operating systems that seek to anticipate what each user will want next. Facebook says Notify is a way to experiment with the notification format and to provide a simple tool to help other companies deliver the right information at the right time. “It’s the most intimate way for you and the information you’re interested in to connect,” said Michael Cerda, a director of product management at Facebook who works on new media products.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Frederick William Chesson never met anyone named Harriet","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"Frederick William Chesson never met anyone named Harriet\\" is true. In fact, the paragraph states the opposite: Frederick William Chesson met Harriet Ann Jacobs when she was in England in 1858. Harriet Ann Jacobs was an African-American writer and abolitionist who gained fame with her autobiography, \\"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,\\" which sheds light on the struggles and hardships faced by enslaved women in the 19th century. To further understand Frederick William Chesson's connection with Harriet Ann Jacobs, it is essential to delve into his background as an anti-slavery campaigner and journalist. Chesson actively participated in the London Aborigines' Protection Society and Emancipation Committee, organizations dedicated to combating slavery and promoting the rights and protection of indigenous peoples. Given his commitment and involvement in abolitionist movements, it is not surprising that Chesson would have crossed paths with Harriet Ann Jacobs, an influential figure who shared his mission to end slavery. Their meeting in England in 1858 would have been an opportunity for them to exchange ideas, experiences, and strategies in their fight against slavery and for the emancipation of oppressed populations. Moreover, Chesson's vocal support of the Union side during the American Civil War further demonstrates his dedication to the abolition of slavery. The Union fought to dismantle the Confederate states' institution of slavery and unite the United States under a common government that abolished the practice. Chesson's alignment with the Union cause is consistent with his fervent activist work in England, showing that he would have likely forged connections with like-minded campaigners, such as Harriet Ann Jacobs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which is better? Question 2: Which is better CA or an MBA? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will go step-by-step and compare various aspects of both careers, such as curriculum, job opportunities, duration, and cost. Step 1: Understand the difference between CA and MBA. CA (Chartered Accountant) is a professional certification in the field of accountancy, auditing, finance, and taxation. It is more focused on the technical aspects of the financial world. MBA (Master of Business Administration) is a postgraduate degree that covers various aspects of business management, such as marketing, finance, HR, operations, and project management. It is more focused on developing management and leadership skills. Step 2: Compare curriculum. CA curriculum involves comprehensive study and practical training in accounting, tax regulations, financial reporting, and auditing. MBA curriculum covers diverse aspects of business and management, allowing students to choose a specialization as per their interest. In this aspect, the best choice depends on the individual's preference for a focused technical skill set (CA) or broader management skills (MBA). Step 3: Compare job opportunities. Both CA and MBA professionals have a wide range of job opportunities. CA professionals mostly work in accounting firms, auditing companies, and finance departments of organizations. MBA professionals can work in various industries depending on their specialization, such as marketing, HR, finance, and operations. MBA professionals generally have access to a wider range of sectors, whereas CA professionals have niche opportunities in the finance and accounting domain. Step 4: Compare duration and cost. CA certification typically takes longer to complete, usually 4-5 years, including practical training. MBA programs usually last for 2 years. In terms of fees, CA courses are relatively cheaper than MBA courses from reputed institutions. Based on the above comparison, to answer the first question: the better choice between CA and MBA depends on the individual's interests, skills, and long-term goals. If one wants to follow a technically focused and specialized financial career, CA might be better. If one wants a versatile management-oriented career with diverse opportunities, MBA might be better. To answer the second question: the better choice between CA and MBA depends on the context. If someone is asking specifically about job sectors related to accounting and finance, the answer might be CA. If they are asking about general job opportunities and management roles, the answer might be MBA. So, while the answer to the first question is more personal and depends on individual preferences and goals, the answer to the second question can differ based on the context in which it is being asked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of increasing drainage in garden pots, various methods can be considered. I will discuss three popular approaches to help you determine which might make the most sense for your particular situation: 1) modifying the pot itself, 2) selecting and using appropriate soil, and 3) adding layers to create additional drainage. 1. Modifying the pot itself: One of the simplest ways to increase drainage is to ensure that the pot has enough drainage holes. Many pots come with pre-drilled drain holes, but sometimes they are insufficient or become blocked. In order to improve drainage, you may want to: -Enlarge existing drainage holes or drill additional ones: Using a drill or a sharp tool, carefully enlarge the existing holes or create new ones in the bottom of the garden pot. Ensure the holes are evenly spaced and not too close to the edges to avoid weakening the structure of the pot. The more holes you have, the better the drainage will be. -Use pots with elevated bottoms: Some pots have a built-in elevated platform on the bottom to keep the soil away from any excess water. These types of pots have better drainage than those with flat bottoms. -Use pot feet or stands: Elevating your garden pot by placing it on feet or a stand can also help improve drainage. This allows excess water to flow out easily and prevents it from pooling at the bottom of the pot. 2. Selecting and using appropriate soil: Using the right type of soil can greatly impact drainage. The ideal potting soil should be light, well-aerated, and porous. To achieve good drainage, consider the following options: -Choose pre-made well-draining potting mix: Many garden centers offer a well-draining potting mix that is specifically formulated for use in containers. These mixes often contain high levels of perlite, vermiculite, or coarse sand which help to promote good drainage. -Create your own well-draining soil mix: If you prefer, you can create your own well-draining soil mix by combining garden soil or compost with generous amounts of perlite, vermiculite, or coarse sand. A general guideline is to use a 2:1 ratio of the base material (garden soil or compost) to the drainage-enhancing ingredient. 3. Adding layers to create additional drainage: Adding layers inside the garden pot can help to improve drainage and prevent the soil from becoming waterlogged. Some popular options include: -Add a layer of drainage material: Before adding the soil to the pot, place a layer of drainage material at the bottom. This can include materials like gravel, pebbles, rocks, or broken pieces of terracotta pots. This layer serves to create a barrier between the soil and water, allowing excess water to flow out more easily. -Use a drainage screen or mesh: Another option is to place a porous screen or mesh at the bottom of the pot above the drainage holes. This prevents soil from clogging the holes while still allowing water to escape. In conclusion, the most sensible approach to increasing drainage in garden pots depends on your specific situation, the materials and tools available to you, and your personal preferences. Modifying the pot itself, selecting an appropriate well-draining soil, and adding layers inside the pot are all viable options. You may choose to combine these methods to achieve the best possible drainage for your plants. Ultimately, a well-drained garden pot is essential for the health of your plants, as it prevents root rot and other issues associated with waterlogged soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact \\"cold environments contain few organisms\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"There are very few species of plants and animals in places like the North Pole because the temperatures are always very\\"","completion":"There are very few species of plants and animals in places like the North Pole because the temperatures are always very low, often reaching well below freezing. These harsh conditions greatly limit the number and diversity of organisms that can survive there. The primary reasons behind this lack of biodiversity in cold environments are as follows: 1. Challenges to Survival: Extremely low temperatures can impede the growth, reproduction, and overall functioning of living organisms. As a result, only species that have evolved specific adaptations to these conditions can survive in such environments. 2. Limited Food and Resources: The scarcity of liquid water, sunlight, and nutrients in cold environments, especially during the long winter months, makes it difficult for plants and animals to flourish. Primary producers (plants) struggle to photosynthesize, leading to energy and food limitations at every level of the ecological pyramid. 3. Slow Metabolism: Cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), like reptiles and most invertebrates, depend on the environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic processes. In cold environments, these animals experience low metabolic rates, leading to decreased energy reserves, slow growth, and reduced reproductive capabilities. 4. Freeze Tolerance and Prevention: In freezing temperatures, ice may form within an organism's body, causing cellular damage or death. The organisms that are able to survive in these environments have evolved specific adaptations, such as producing antifreeze proteins or undergoing hibernation to minimize ice formation and tissue damage. 5. Short Growing Season: In high-latitude ecosystems, such as the polar regions, the growing season is incredibly brief due to the extreme tilt of the Earth relative to the sun. This results in considerably less sunlight available for plants to use in photosynthesis and ultimately, less energy production and primary productivity. 6. Limited Habitat: Cold environments are often characterized by ice, permafrost, or snow cover, which limits the availability of suitable habitats for plants and animals. This curtails the possibilities for organisms to establish and maintain diverse populations. 7. Low Genetic Diversity: The small number of organisms in these settings can lead to low genetic diversity. This low diversity could make it difficult for species to adapt to changing conditions, placing them at greater risk of extinction. 8. Dispersal Barriers: Cold regions often present barriers to dispersal for many species. This lack of connectivity can contribute to a reduced gene flow and increased risk of inbreeding, limiting the capacity of species to adapt to changing conditions or colonize new areas. In conclusion, the low biodiversity observed in cold environments like the North Pole is primarily due to the range of challenges that these harsh conditions represent. Organisms in these environments must overcome numerous obstacles, including low temperatures, limited food and resources, slow metabolism, freeze tolerance, a brief growing season, habitat limitations, and low genetic diversity, among others. These combined factors make it exceptionally difficult for plants and animals to establish and maintain diverse populations, resulting in the few species that are specially adapted to withstand such extreme conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox delivers a keynote address at Facebook's ''fMC'' global event for marketers in New York City in this February 29, 2012 file photograph. SAN FRANCISCO | SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc aims to raise about 10.6 billion in Silicon Valley's largest IPO, dwarfing the coming-out parties of tech companies like Google Inc and granting the world's largest social network a market value close to Amazon.com's. The eight-year-old social network that began as Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room project indicated an initial public offering price range of between 28 and 35 a share on Thursday, which would value the company at 77 billion to 96 billion. The size of the IPO reflects the company's growth and bullish expectations about its money-making potential as a hub for everything from advertising to commerce. \\"We certainly haven't ever seen a tech IPO on this grandiose a scale,\\" said Lise Buyer, a principal with the IPO advisory firm Class V Group. Buyer, who worked on Google's 2004 IPO, said the question about a company \\"that's already this big and that is raising this much money is how many of the glory days of growth are in the past versus how many are ahead.\\" Facebook stands to raise as much as 12 billion at the upper end of its planned range. If an over-allotment or \\"greenshoe\\" option is triggered, the company could sweep up a maximum of 13.6 billion, according to a Thursday prospectus. Facebook is only getting about half, or 5.6 billion, of the estimated 10.6 billion that it would raise at the midpoint of its planned IPO range. About 4.9 billon will go to some existing shareholders. Facebook's stock could begin trading as soon as May 18, according to a road show schedule obtained by Reuters. The offering's price range can be adjusted depending on Wall Street's response during the road show. Investors are expected to flock to the highly anticipated IPO, although there have been growing concerns about the social network's longer-term growth and Zuckerberg's majority control. Facebook will trade at 13 to 16 times the revenue that GreenCrest Capital analyst Max Wolff believes it will generate this year. By comparison, Google, the world's dominant Internet search engine, currently trades at 5.5 to 6 times expected 2012 revenue, he said. Google's valuation was higher when it went public in 2004, though Facebook's IPO valuation is still higher than Google's was back then, Wolff noted. But some observers said the rich premium was unlikely to deter investors. \\"People are going to be very comfortable with this valuation,\\" said Sam Schwerin of Millennium Technology Value Partners, which owns Facebook shares worth roughly 200 million. The firm is not selling in the IPO. \\"A price range of 28 to 35 will be a relief to some people who are concerned that they may try to take the highest possible price because of high demand,\\" he said. \\"The amount being raised is noteworthy. Selling stockholders are raising about 5 billion in the IPO, which is a lot.\\" Facebook executives are due to hit the road on Monday, presenting their investment case to audiences. They will start in New York, go to other major cities such as Chicago and Boston, and end up on Facebook's home turf in Menlo Park, California, according to the schedule. Zuckerberg is expected to participate in the two-week road show, a source has said, although Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Finance Chief David Ebersman will lead the briefings. TANTALIZING WALL STREET Zuckerberg's involvement in the road show will be key for investors with concerns about Facebook's long-term strategy and money-making potential, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Zuckerberg's control of the company -- which was underscored when he orchestrated the 1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker Instagram last month -- means that investors need to \\"get comfortable\\" with the 27-year-old CEO, said Wieser. Last week, Facebook reported its first quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years, a sign that the social network's sizzling growth may be cooling just as it prepares to go public. Some observers have also flagged the company's lack of revenue on mobile devices such as smartphones as an area of concern. Dressed in a gray t-shirt and jeans, the copper-haired Zuckerberg appeared in a 31-minute road show video posted online on Thursday. In the video, Zuckerberg predicted that in five years almost every software app would be integrated with Facebook. Facebook generated the lion's share of its 3.7 billion in revenue last year from online advertising. It also collects fees when consumers use its special Credits currency to purchase virtual goods in social games such as Zynga's Farmville. The company has said it may expand the use of its payment business beyond games. Facebook, which plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq under the ticker \\"FB\\", has long tantalized investors with the prospect of a mega IPO. As a private company, shares of Facebook have traded briskly in secondary markets for the past couple of years, as investors sought to get a piece of the fast-growing company ahead of its expected IPO. The IPO price range indicated in Facebook's filing on Thursday would value the company a hair below the level it has traded at in the secondary markets in recent months, with some trades valuing the company at slightly more than 100 billion. But some investors think Facebook, which touts 900 million users worldwide, is setting itself a fairly conservative target. \\"The price range may be tactical. They will likely walk the range up,\\" Schwerin argued. Facebook plans to sell 337.4 million shares, or 12.3 percent of the company, in the offering. The capital-raising target far outstrips big Internet IPOs that came before it. Google raised just shy of 2 billion in 2004, while last year Groupon tapped investors for 700 million and Zynga raked in 1 billion. At the top end of the IPO range, Facebook would rival the market value of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems Inc, which are worth just over 100 billion, and surpass the combined market value of older technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc. Among existing shareholders, the largest seller in the IPO will be venture capital firm Accel Partners, which will make about 1.2 billion assuming the shares sell at the 31.5 mid-point. Zuckerberg is selling the next largest chunk of shares, worth a little under 1 billion. Facebook said that a \\"substantial majority\\" of the proceeds from Zuckerberg's stock sale will be used to satisfy taxes he will incur from exercising his options. In its prospectus, Facebook said the \\"lock-up\\" period, during which employees cannot sell shares after the IPO, would range from 151 days to 181 days. Facebook also added two new underwriters, including online broker E*Trade Securities. The broker caters to retail clients who some have speculated may try to pile into the IPO. \\"No doubt Facebook doesn't want to upset the average mom and pop out there,\\" said Craig Huber, research analyst, at independent research firm Huber Research Partners.

McCormick, Bernadette Baum, Matthew Lewis and Richard Pullin) ||||| Buried in Facebook’s amended S-1 is a fun little nugget of information: CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be selling 30.2 million of his shares in the company’s initial public offering, a sale that will net him roughly 1 billion. In the lead-up to its IPO, Facebook set its opening price range at 28 to 35 a share Thursday — but that could change. Financial data company PrivCo said that underwriters plan to raise the range to 38 to 40 per share prior to the IPO for an initial day price pop. Depending on the final share price, Zuckerberg will take home between 845 million and 1.2 billion on IPO day. Alas, the 1 billion payout will be largely used for the oh-so-fun activity of paying taxes. Good times. “Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, will exercise an outstanding stock option with respect to 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and will then offer 30,200,000 of those shares as Class A common stock in our initial public offering,” Facebook said in an amendment to its S-1 Thursday. “We expect that the substantial majority of the net proceeds Mr. Zuckerberg will receive upon such sale will be used to satisfy taxes that he will incur in connection with the option exercise.” And fear not faithful Facebook subjects, the sale of shares won’t adversely affect Zuckerberg’s control of the board. The social networking company’s founder and CEO will control approximately 57.3 percent of voting power when the company pops up on the public market, according to the revised prospectus.

Facebook's initial public offering price range was anticipated to be between 28 and 35 a share, placing the company's value at 77 billion to 96 billion. The unprecedented scale of Facebook's IPO highlighted the company's massive growth and the optimistic expectations for its financial potential, including advertising and commerce. The high IPO valuation was not expected to deter investors, with Facebook's stock anticipated to trade at 13 to 16 times its expected revenue for that year.

Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh yeah i've read a lot of his too\\" implies that the speaker has read a considerable amount of the author's work. Sentence 2: \\"I have been reading his work for a long time.\\" indicates that the speaker has been reading the author's work over an extended period. Step 2: Compare the core meanings of both sentences. Both sentences express that the speaker has engaged in reading the author's work, but they convey slightly different aspects. Sentence 1 describes the quantity of the author's work the speaker has read, while Sentence 2 involves the duration of the speaker's engagement with the author's work. Step 3: Determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Given the differences in the aspects highlighted by the two sentences, it is not possible to determine for certain that the second sentence is entailed by the first one. The first sentence allows for the possibility that the speaker has read a lot of the author's work in a short period of time, while the second sentence specifically mentions a long time.

Given the question: Process: - Sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant - The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is raining happens, how will it affect less sunlight hits chloroplasts. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of rain resulting in less sunlight hitting the chloroplasts will have an indirect effect on the process of photosynthesis. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Sunlight is a crucial component for the process of photosynthesis, as it provides the energy required to initiate the reaction. 2. If it's raining and cloudy, less sunlight will reach the plant's chloroplasts, which will, in turn, limit the plant's ability to efficiently carry out photosynthesis. 3. With limited sunlight, the energy available to break apart water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons will also be reduced. This will lower the overall rate of the photosynthesis process. 4. The production of NADPH, which is an essential molecule for the Calvin cycle and the creation of glucose, will decrease due to the limited availability of energized hydrogen and electrons. 5. Consequently, the plant's overall growth and energy production will be affected, as photosynthesis is the primary way in which plants convert sunlight into usable energy. To summarize, the perturbation of rain and the resulting decrease in sunlight will have an indirect effect on the photosynthesis process. The reduced availability of sunlight will limit the efficiency of the reaction, leading to decreased production of vital molecules such as oxygen and NADPH, and ultimately impacting the plant's growth and energy production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer a question about this article: Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more black women than men. They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males. The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex), leading to many mixed-race children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as umm walad or \\"mother of a child\\", a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father's property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father. Because the society was patrilineal, the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free. What were female slaves used for?","completion":"Female slaves were mainly used for domestic work and helping in agriculture. They took care of the household chores and helped in farming.

OPT: + unacceptable + acceptable","completion":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"This polish cleans, protects, and shines.\\" to be acceptable linguistically as it conforms to the general rules and principles of grammar, syntax, and semantics. The sentence properly conveys a coherent and meaningful message that an English speaker can understand and interpret. Let's break down the components of the sentence to analyze its linguistic acceptability. 1. Grammar: The sentence follows standard English grammar rules. The subject, \\"This polish,\\" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific object or product. The verbs in the sentence, \\"cleans,\\" \\"protects,\\" and \\"shines,\\" are simple present tense forms and are parallel in structure. The use of commas to separate the verbs is also a proper grammatical application of listing several actions related to the subject. 2. Syntax: The sentence is structured appropriately, with the subject at the beginning (This polish) followed by the main verbs and their respective objects. The proper comma usage in the list of actions makes the sentence syntactically sound. 3. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous. It conveys the notion that the stated polish has multiple functions like cleaning, protecting, and shining. Each verb in the sentence describes a specific quality or action of the polish, and these actions are related to the intended purpose of the product, which would most likely be to care for and maintain the appearance of an object or surface. 4. Cohesion: The sentence is coherent and cohesive since the verbs used are all related to the primary subject - the polish. Each action provided can be understood as a feature or benefit of the polish and communicates its value and function. Based on these points, a linguist would deem the sentence \\"This polish cleans, protects, and shines.\\" to be acceptable from a linguistic perspective. It meets the necessary criteria for proper grammar, syntax, semantics, and cohesion, resulting in a clear and comprehensible message."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Were crucial procedures that might have prevented the victim--who Liberian officials have identified as Thomas Eric Duncan, according to an article in the New York Times--from arriving in the United States not in place? CDC epidemiologists performing the painstaking \\"contact tracing\\" of the patient's movements for the four days he was symptomatic in the","completion":"United States have begun piecing together a clearer picture of how the virus may have been transmitted and whether any other individuals are at risk. The process involves interviewing the patient, his family, friends, and any others he may have come into contact with, while also examining travel records, flight manifests, and other data to determine the extent of potential exposure. According to the CDC, Duncan initially sought medical care on September 26, but was sent home with antibiotics, despite having informed the hospital staff of his recent travel history in Liberia. It wasn't until September 28 that he was admitted to the hospital, isolated, and tested for Ebola. This crucial misstep has raised concerns about the preparedness of US hospitals to handle Ebola cases, as well as the effectiveness of the screening procedures at airports for travelers coming from Ebola-affected regions in West Africa. Furthermore, Liberian authorities have stated that Duncan lied about his potential exposure to the virus before leaving the country, raising additional concerns about the efficacy of airport health screenings in affected countries and the role of personal responsibility in preventing the spread of the virus. \\"It's not a case of 'if,' but 'when' the next Ebola case will surface in the US,\\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. However, both CDC officials and many public health experts have emphasized that while the virus's arrival in the United States is certainly notable, it does not pose a significant threat to public health, given the nation's modern healthcare infrastructure and robust infection control protocols. So, why did Duncan slip through the cracks, and how can we prevent such events from happening in the future? Some experts argue that airport health screenings lack precision and can be easily evaded with dishonest answers, while others blame the fragmented nature of the US healthcare system, which can lead to discrepancies in how potential Ebola cases are handled. As a result, many calls have been made to strengthen the existing protocols and procedures, in order to prevent future transmission. These measures might include pre-departure Ebola screenings in the affected countries, more comprehensive medical histories for international travelers, better coordination among healthcare providers, and increased training for hospital staff so they can more effectively identify and respond to potential Ebola cases. It is crucial to remember that while the United States is well-equipped to handle isolated Ebola cases, tracking and containing the virus in its source region of West Africa remains the best way to prevent a global outbreak. Bolstering public health infrastructure there and supporting efforts to combat the spread of the virus can not only save countless lives but also significantly diminish the risk of Ebola transmission beyond the region. This includes providing adequate resources, personnel, and training to treat patients, trace contacts, and break the chain of transmission. In conclusion, Thomas Eric Duncan's arrival in the United States and subsequent Ebola diagnosis have put a spotlight on the potential weaknesses in our nation's preparedness to deal with this deadly virus. It is now up to healthcare officials, policymakers, and the general public to acknowledge these shortcomings and take action to prevent future incidences, both domestically and across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From blogs, news articles, tutorials, and research papers to social media profiles, web apps, and online communities, there's an unlimited number of resources at our fingertips. With so much to explore, keeping track of web pages and finding your way back to relevant content can be a daunting task. This is where the simple yet powerful feature of browser bookmarks comes in. Bookmarks are essentially shortcuts to your favorite or frequently visited web pages that make the process of revisiting them much more straightforward. However, as you accumulate more and more bookmarks, keeping them organized and easy to navigate becomes crucial for an efficient browsing experience. In this article, we will discuss some valuable tips and methods to optimize your bookmark management, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced techniques. 1. Bookmarking a page using the star icon: Almost all modern browsers have a quick and straightforward method for bookmarking web pages. Simply look for a small star icon next to the URL in the address bar. By clicking on it, you can instantly save the current page as a bookmark. Depending on your browser, you may also be prompted to choose a folder or destination for your new bookmark, so it stays organized from the very beginning. 2. Exploiting the power of the bookmark bar: For web pages you visit frequently, like your email, calendar, or project management tools, consider using the bookmark bar. This is a toolbar, typically located directly below the address bar, that provides one-click access to your favorite sites. Adding bookmarks to this toolbar is as easy as clicking and dragging the website's URL or the tab directly into the desired position on the bar. Additionally, you can remove the bookmark titles to save space and only display the site's icon for a cleaner look. 3. Organizing bookmarks with folders: As the number of your bookmarks grows, organizing them into folders and subfolders becomes essential. By keeping similar bookmarks grouped together in folders, you can quickly locate and access information when you need it. This is especially helpful when you have countless bookmarks related to different interests, projects, or topics. To create a new folder, open your bookmark manager — this can usually be found in the browser's menu under \\"Bookmarks\\" or \\"Favorites.\\" From there, you can create and name new folders, as well as drag and drop existing bookmarks into these organized categories. 4. Making the most of subfolders: When organizing bookmarks, don't hesitate to create subfolders within your existing folders for even more granularity. This is particularly useful when certain bookmark categories have significant variations or cover multiple sub-topics. Breaking them down further into subfolders will make it easier for you to locate the exact information you're looking for at any given moment. 5. Harnessing the potential of bookmark organizing extensions: Modern browsers also offer various extensions and add-ons that can automatically handle your bookmark organizing tasks. These tools can detect duplicates, analyze the content of your bookmarks, automatically sort them into folders based on their themes, and even suggest a more appropriate location when you're adding a new bookmark. Some popular bookmark organizing extensions include Tidy Bookmarks for Chrome, Bookmark Sort & Backup for Firefox, and Raindrop.io, which provides cross-browser compatibility. Conclusion: Efficiently organizing your bookmarks can massively enhance your browsing experience, making it easier for you to revisit your favorite sites and find relevant content efficiently. By using the star icon for quick bookmarking, taking advantage of the bookmark bar, and implementing folder and subfolder organization, you can transform your bloated and unordered bookmarks list into a well-structured, easily navigable system. Furthermore, browser extensions can provide automated assistance in maintaining your bookmark organization, so that you can focus on discovering and enjoying new content without losing track of essential resources. With the right approach and tools, organizing your bookmarks is a breeze, and you can enjoy a faster, more streamlined browsing experience."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A boat, on the other hand, is a smaller watercraft and is more suitable for shallow water navigation. Boats are primarily used for recreational purposes, fishing, or short distance transportation. 2. A ship is traditionally referred to as \\"she\\" in English due to the cultural and maritime tradition of personifying vessels as feminine entities. This personification started centuries ago, and ships are addressed as \\"she\\" as a sign of affection and respect from their crew.

If you ask, \\"why would anyone ever do that,\\" then you obviously haven't heard of the \\"Condom Snorting Challenge.\\" This is what you would do if you wanted to participate in this \\"Challenge\\" and demonstrate to everyone that you have absolutely no proper judgment. You would unwrap a new condom (because a used condom would be even worse) inhale it up one nostril and then try to pull it out through your pharynx and mouth, all the while filming it to then post the video on YouTube or some other social media platform. This \\"Condom Challenge\\" is actually not new and has been around for a number of years, because stupidity doesn't go away that easily. Back in 2013, Alex Alvarez wrote for ABC News about how a YouTube video uploaded in June 2007 showed the act and how the Challenge may have gotten more attention when YouTuber \\"Savannah Strong\\" posted on April 8, 2013, a video of her snorting a condom to the tune of Taylor Swift's \\"22.\\" In case you are wondering what it looks like, here's a Tweet with a picture: Doesn't that look wonderful? If you want to see what it looks like in action, a number of videos (such as this one) pop up on YouTube when you search for \\"condom snorting\\" but beware they may make you wince. Gee, what could go wrong when inhaling an object made of latex rubber and covered in lubricant and spermicide? Well, first of all, here's the list of things that you should be snorting up you nose: Air The only possible addition to this list would be medications like nasal sprays, but only when your doctor recommends them and there is a true medical indication. Otherwise, anything else that goes up your nose can damage the sensitive inner lining of your nose, cause an allergic reaction, or result in an infection. I've already written for Forbes about the dangers of snorting chocolate and similar concerns apply to most other substances. Now, imagine stuffing up your nose something that is larger than your nostril opening and designed not to break. That would be as foolish as, well, trying to inhale a condom. The condom could easily get stuck in your nose or your throat, blocking your breathing or causing you to choke. But that's not all. Take a look at a case report published in 2004 in the Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences entitled \\"Accidental condom inhalation,\\" which distinguishes it from deliberate condom inhalation, which is basically the \\"Condom Snorting Challenge.\\" The case report detailed the tribulations of a 27-year-old woman who performed oral sex on a man wearing a condom. The condom went down her trachea and into her lungs, blocked one of her airways, and resulted in pneumonia and a collapse of the right upper lobe of her lung. That would qualify as a bad oral sex experience. Then there's the case report in the Journal of Medical Case Reports of a 26-year old woman who accidentally swallowed a condom (again, with the emphasis on the word accidentally) during oral sex and then subsequently developed appendicitis because a fragment of the condom lodged inside her appendix. While this does not necessarily mean that you should panic if you accidentally swallow a condom (because you may just eventually poop it out), it does strongly suggest that you should not deliberately inhale or swallow a condom. Even if you manage to successfully pull the condom out through your mouth, inhaling a condom up your nose would be very uncomfortable and potentially quite painful. Would it really be worth all that just to get more likes and views? Apparently enough teens still think it's worthwhile, to the point that educators are now visiting San Antonio, Texas-area schools to discuss drug, alcohol, and condom-snorting prevention, as Darian Trotter for NBC News 4 San Antonio reported. Welcome to 2018. Who knew that teens would need to be told not to use condoms? ||||| Snorting a condom to pull it out from the throat as a fad has been around for a while, but parents are now being warned about it. Teens are constantly finding new ways of putting rubber to use and one trending fad is also giving parents sleepless nights: condom snorting. Parents in San Antonio, Texas, are learning through education classes that an increasing number of teens are looking up the “condom challenge.” Contrary to what the challenge may suggest, it is not about using the prophylactic for intended purposes. Instead, teens are challenged to snort an unused condom through a nostril only to pull it out from the mouth, while being filmed, a local Fox News affiliate reports. In the San Antonio class, Stephen Enriquez, one of the educators, is telling parents of school-aged children that psychotropic substances are not the only thing they need to fear. “These days our teens are doing everything for likes, views, and subscribers. As graphic as it is, we have to show parents because teens are going online looking for challenges and recreating them.” The use of condoms in pranks and challenges is not new. After the Ice Bucket Challenge gained popularity, new ways to drop water on heads were tried and condom challenges became a craze. Amidst growing concerns of safety, health experts warned about risk of suffocation when a water-filled condom wraps around the head. Soon after, it appears, videos of attempts to snort and extract condoms from the throat started garnering attention. The Newest Teen Challenge: Snorting Condoms https://t.co/rUcT8FCaFp pic.twitter.com/8tORmcW3Za — News 19 WLTX (@WLTX) April 1, 2018 Besides the unpleasant feeling one is likely to experience when sensitive nasal passages are lined with chemicals a condom contains, including glycerin and spermicide, infections and allergic reactions are likely. More importantly, snorting a condom, which is designed not to break, becomes a choking hazard if it blocks the airway. While choking or a fatality has not been caught on tape, a few patient case studies reported in medical literature indicate what a condom that enters the respiratory tract can do. Condoms entering the digestive tract, including appendix, cause sickness, and have been reported more often. In 2004, researchers in India described the troubles of a 27-year-old who accidentally inhaled a condom while performing oral sex. The object was later located and removed with a bronchoscope. “The lady presented with persistent cough, sputum and fever for the preceding six months. Trials with antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis treatment for the preceding four months did not improve symptoms. A subsequent chest radiograph showed non-homogeneous collapse-consolidation of right upper lobe.” Forbes contributor Bruce Y. Lee mentions a YouTube video from 2007 that reportedly demonstrated the act. But it may not have been until 2013 when the condom snorting challenge began gaining traction. Clearly, the condom challenge is not new, and is likely to stay. ||||| The year 1735 saw the first appendicectomy, which was performed on an 11-year-old boy at St. Georgeâ€™s Hospital in London by Claudius Amyand during which a sewing pin was found to have perforated the appendix [6]. FBs in the appendix are uncommon but well described with an estimated prevalence of 0.0005 % [7, 8]. FBs generally do not cause any complications and pass through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) spontaneously within a week. The complication rate of ingested FBs is estimated at less than 1 % [8]. Various objects acting as FBs have been reported in the literature to be the cause of acute appendicitis, including bird shot, bullets, fishing lines, screws, coins, stones, toothbrush bristle, pins, needles, teeth, bone fragments, dog hair, fruit seeds and pits, toothpicks, drill bits, tongue studs, crown post, keys and intrauterine contraceptive devices [3, 4, 7â€“11]. Considering the dependent position of the cecum and to some extent its low motility, such FBs tend to gravitate and settle there. In addition, the chance of entry to the appendiceal lumen is determined not only by its orifice (which might be tight or widely open) but also by the anatomic position of the appendix. There is almost no possibility for a FB to enter the lumen of a retrocecal appendix [8]. Once the FB is lodged in the appendix, peristaltic motion is usually insufficient to expel it back into the cecal lumen. It may remain immobile in the appendix without stimulating an inflammatory process or cause an inflammatory reaction with or without perforation. The period of latency between ingestion of the FB and the onset of symptoms varies from hours to years [4, 9, 11]. Complications usually depend on the size and shape of the FB. Blunt FBs cause appendicitis through obstruction of the appendiceal lumen and remain dormant for longer periods. Elongated sharp FBs are more likely to cause perforations, appendicular abscesses, and peritonitis [4, 8â€“10]. In our case, there was no history suggestive of FB ingestion during clinical evaluation. However, following retrieval of the condom fragment from the patientâ€™s appendix and its presentation to the patient postoperatively, she could recall having performed oral sex on her boyfriend 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. She reported that the condom had loosened during the act and she accidentally ingested it. She however did not find it necessary to inform us as she did not think it was the cause of her symptoms because she had passed out fragments of the ingested condom in her feces 5 days after ingestion. It is likely that during its migration in the GIT the condom was torn into fragments and a piece was trapped within the vermiform appendix and the rest expelled in fecal matter. Arya et al. [12] had reported a case where multiple pieces of a condom were retrieved from the bronchus of a 27-year-old Indian woman. As in the present case report, she inhaled the condom during oral sex. Apart from accidental ingestion of a condom during oral sex, it is important to note that the act is also associated with several other complications including a significant risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, hepatitis viruses, gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus infections [13]. There is a need to increase awareness of the potential dangers of ingested FBs. Each time such incidents occur, it is advisable patients report promptly for proper evaluation and follow-up until the FB is properly traced as it may account for significant morbidity and mortality. ||||| Another internet challenge has some parents on alert and just about everyone's eyebrows standing straight up. Viral video on YouTube has been circulating and shared thousands of times, showing teenagers and young adults snorting condoms. There is a fine line between bravery and stupidity, but the line isn't so fine when people snort condoms. Internet challenges rule the world wide web but long gone are the days of milk-chugging and spoonfuls of cinnamon. The Tide pod challenge brought millions to a halt, the Carolina reaper challenge seemed to affect anyone who tried the spicy pepper, but the condom challenge is different because of the tool employed. \\"It's all about progress; this is better than eating tide pods,\\" said one man. \\"It's crazy and dangerous, and parents should be quite alarmed to learn this is the new phenomenon,\\" one father told NBC Charlotte. All of these challenges are done to garner likes, clicks, and attention. While ingesting Tide can be poisonous, the most likely result from putting a condom up your nose is throwing up whatever you ate for dinner. © 2018 WCNC ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Some teenagers and young adults have been participating in a dangerous and strange challenge called the \\"Condom Snorting Challenge.\\" In this challenge, a person puts a condom up one nostril, tries to snort it through their nose, and then pull it out from their mouth, all while filming the act to post on social media. This can cause serious harm, such as choking, allergic reactions, infections, or even complications like pneumonia if the condom gets stuck in their respiratory system.

Question: What language does Sindhu translate Tyagaraja keerthanam to? Movie plot title: Sindhu Bhairavi Movie plot: J.K. Balaganapathy (Sivakumar), popularly known as JKB, is a gifted carnatic musician but his wife Bhairavi (Sulakshana), despite her love and loyalty, fails to satisfy or challenge him intellectually. For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, and he is a compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth. Sindhu (Suhasini), working as a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate.

The incident occurs during one of the concerts of J.K. Balaganapathy (JKB), a gifted carnatic musician, where Sindhu is part of the audience. In the event, JKB is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam in Telugu, a language that not everyone in the crowd understands. Sindhu notices this language barrier and sees audience members talking amongst themselves instead of immersing in the performance. Determined to make it more enjoyable and meaningful for everyone, she approaches JKB and asks him to translate the keethanam to Tamil, a language that would be understood by the entire audience. This request angers JKB but also throws down a challenge to Sindhu to do the translation herself, in front of the audience. Sindhu accepts this challenge and indeed succeeds in demonstrating the translation of the Telugu keerthanam into Tamil right at the spot. Her successful translation not only earns the applause of the crowd but also makes JKB acknowledge her talent and deep understanding of music. He is amazed to know her intellectual capacity and appreciates her abilities. Thus, Sindhu's act of translation bridged the linguistic gap and enhanced the concert, and she thus paved her way into JKB's admiration and respect. Therefore, in summary, Sindhu translates the Tyagaraja keerthanam from Telugu to Tamil during a concert performed by J.K. Balaganapathy (JKB), surpassing his expectations and impressing the audience and JKB himself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: The Senate took a key step Tuesday toward ratifying a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, voting 67 to 28 to end debate on the matter and proceed to a final vote. The \\"cloture\\" vote indicated that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), one of the Obama administration's highest priorities, is all but certain to be ratified when the Senate holds a final vote, expected as soon as Wednesday. \\"This treaty will make America safer and restore our leadership in global efforts to stop nuclear proliferation,\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement after the vote. He said he was \\"encouraged\\" by Republican support for the treaty and expressed hope that \\"when the Senate votes tomorrow on ratification, we will send a powerful statement about America's commitment to nonproliferation with a strong bipartisan vote.\\" Tuesday's crucial vote advancing the treaty came after several Republican senators publicly declared their support, apparently putting the pact over the top despite the objections of the Senate's top two GOP leaders and the bulk of their caucus. The Republican declarations of support followed intense last-minute efforts by administration officials, senior military leaders and other advocates of the pact to ensure its passage on grounds that it enhances U.S. national security and nonproliferation interests. Adm. Mike Mullen, the nation's top military officer, and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates appealed to the Senate to approve the treaty. In floor speeches before Tuesday's vote, two Republicans from Tennessee - Sen. Lamar Alexander, the third-ranking GOP leader in the chamber, and Bob Corker - announced their support for the pact. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement declaring her backing for ratification, and Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) gave a floor speech reaffirming that he would vote for the pact. Alexander and Corker were the eighth and ninth Republicans to publicly commit to voting for the treaty, but several others had said they are leaning toward doing so. The pact needed at least nine Republican votes to reach the two-thirds threshold necessary for passage. The cloture vote was considered critical as an indicator of sufficient support for final passage. While the White House had expected Alexander to back the treaty, he had sounded less certain in recent days, as Republicans lashed out at the administration for pushing ratification in the waning days of the lame-duck session. In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, Alexander made his support public for the first time. \\"I will vote to ratify the New START Treaty . . . because it leaves our country with enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come,\\" Alexander said. \\"I'm convinced that Americans are safer and more secure with the New START Treaty than without it.\\" Alexander also pointed out that Obama had committed to spending about 85 billion on modernizing America's nuclear complex over the next 10 years, a 14 billion increase over what otherwise might have been spent. Corker said later, \\"I firmly believe that signing this treaty, that ratifying this treaty . . . is in our country's national interest.\\" ||||| “Today’s bipartisan vote clears a significant hurdle in the Senate,” said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the president’s chief ally on the floor. “We are on the brink of writing the next chapter in the 40-year history of wrestling with the threat of nuclear weapons .” Republican critics called it a bad deal, arguing that the treaty’s inspections were inadequate and that nonbinding language in its preamble could give Russia leverage to try to keep the United States from deploying missile defense installations in Eastern Europe. Photo “The administration did not negotiate a good treaty,” said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona , the No. 2 Republican and the leader of the opposition. “They went into negotiations, it seems to me, with the attitude with the Russians just like the guy that goes into the car dealership and says, ‘I’m not leaving here until I buy a car.’ ” The treaty requires the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear stockpiles so that within seven years of ratification neither deploys more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers. It would also resume the on-site inspections that lapsed last December with the expiration of the original Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or Start. The agreement brings down the legal ceilings set by previous Russian-American treaties that it would now supplant. Under the Treaty of Moscow , signed by President George W. Bush in 2002, each side is allowed no more than 2,200 warheads as of 2012. Under Start, signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, each side was required to reduce launchers to 1,600 before it expired last year. The United States currently has 1,950 deployed strategic warheads and 798 deployed launchers, according to the Federation of American Scientists, while Russia has 2,540 deployed strategic warheads and 574 strategic launchers. Because of counting rules, each side may not have to shelve as many weapons as those numbers imply, according to experts. The debate over the treaty, however, ranged far beyond the numbers, revealing starkly different visions for national security in the 21st century. Mr. Obama and his supporters argued that ratification was essential to rebuilding a relationship with Russia and maintaining the international coalition against Iran’s nuclear program . His critics said it represented a first step toward a dangerous and wrong-headed vision of eventually eliminating the world’s nuclear weapons. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It also became entangled in issues like gay men and lesbians in the military, which some Republicans said poisoned the water for the treaty. And some critics questioned Mr. Obama’s willingness as commander in chief to resist Russian pressure to drop missile defense to preserve the pact down the road. “I cannot imagine this president taking it to the limit with the Russians because nothing he has done has convinced me that he is committed to missile defense,” said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , who added that it was “a monumental mistake” to approve the treaty in a lame-duck session. Photo But the White House cast Mr. Obama in the shadow of President Ronald Reagan , who also talked of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. “Our reductions in these are legacies of many presidents, including former President Ronald Reagan,” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary. “And it makes the world safer.” Mr. Obama enlisted the elder Mr. Bush, former Republican secretaries of state, the nation’s military commanders and Eastern European leaders to knock down objections. Every time a Republican needed assurance about missile defense, verification or nuclear modernization, supporters produced letters or statements from prominent figures. In a final such letter to several senators, released Tuesday, Mr. Obama repeated his commitment to a 10-year, 85 billion program to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons complex to ensure that a shrinking nuclear arsenal would still be effective. “My administration will pursue these programs and capabilities for as long as I am president,” he wrote.

Biden Jr. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Capitol Hill, the reassurances won over Republicans like Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Johnny Isakson of Georgia , all of whom announced their support just before Tuesday’s vote. “I’m convinced that America is safer and more secure with the New Start treaty than without it,” said Mr. Alexander, who just last week voted to block consideration of the pact on the floor. He cited Mr. Obama’s modernization letter and added that the treaty still left the United States with “enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come.” Other Republicans who voted to advance the treaty on Tuesday were Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah , Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, Thad Cochran of Mississippi , Susan Collins of Maine , Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio . The vote cleared the way for a final vote, although senators discussed a number of Republican amendments late into the night. Mr. Kerry accepted two Republican-sponsored side statements that called for modernizing nuclear delivery systems and opening new talks with Russia to reduce tactical nuclear weapons. The fate of another provision on missile defense, sponsored by Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona, remained undecided. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In this news article, it talks about the Senate trying to approve a new treaty with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons both countries have.

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Sumner and Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were was inspired by the Pistol's performance. The following day Hook borrowed PS35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. Sumner said that he felt that they \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in\\". Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they sped off. In August 1977, the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \\"fitted perfectly\\" with the other men, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \\"complete 'family'\\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing their new name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel House of Dolls. In December, the group recorded what became their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at The Swinging Apple in Liverpool. Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester.

Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed, because the purpose of the display (educating the public on American legal traditions) was secular in nature. In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3, 2006, however, a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The seventh year of the 2000s was 2007, and it witnessed several notable events and developments around the world. In the context of the previous legal rulings, 2007 was also an important year for court decisions and legislation in the United States. Below is an overview of some significant events in 2007, with a focus on American legal developments: 1. Virginia Tech Shooting: On April 16, 2007, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history took place at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. The shooter, Seung-Hui Cho, killed 32 people and wounded 17 others before taking his own life. 2. The U.S. Attorney Dismissal Controversy: Controversy arose in 2007 when the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, fired nine United States Attorneys. Critics argued that these dismissals were politically motivated, which led to hearings, investigations, and the subsequent resignation of Gonzales on September 17, 2007. 3. Legalization of Same-Sex Civil Unions: In May 2007, the state of New Hampshire became the fourth state in the United States to legalize same-sex civil unions, granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as heterosexual couples. 4. Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Upheld: On April 18, 2007, in Gonzales v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on partial-birth abortion (also known as intact dilation and extraction). This marked the first time the Court had allowed a limitation on abortion with no exception for preserving the health of the woman, sparking ongoing debates about reproductive rights. 5. Iraq War Surge: President George W. Bush announced a new strategy for the Iraq War, known as \\"The New Way Forward,\\" in January 2007. The plan included sending an additional 20,000 U.S. troops to bring stability to the country and renew efforts in rebuilding its infrastructure. 6. Jena Six Incident: Racial tensions erupted in Jena, Louisiana, after six African American high school students, known as the Jena Six, were charged with attempted murder for assaulting a white student in December 2006. The case gained national attention, and the severity of the charges faced by the students led to protests, drawing thousands of demonstrators in September 2007. 7. iPhone Launch: On June 29, 2007, Apple released its first iPhone, changing the landscape of mobile phone technology and leading to the widespread adoption of smartphones worldwide. These are just a few of the significant events that took place in 2007. While these events are not directly related to the Ten Commandments or Mount Soledad cross controversy, they illustrate the diverse range of social, political, and technological developments that occurred during the seventh year of the 2000s. In terms of legal expansion and awareness, these events had significant impacts on American culture, law, and the broader global landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the key components of the sentence: \\"is not,\\" \\"that,\\" \\"what,\\" \\"we speak.\\" 2.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Elvis Presley's death became a controversy at the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial as a man who promoted both artists' last tours testified. AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware testified Wednesday that Presley died of a drug overdose, but when his own lawyer questioned him Thursday he changed his testimony to say Elvis died of a heart ailment. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem.

Solve -20*l - 106*l = 1134 for l.","completion":"To solve the given equation, -20*l - 106*l = 1134 for l, we will follow the below steps: Step 1: Combine like terms Both terms on the left-hand side of the equation have the variable 'l', so we can combine those terms. -20*l - 106*l = -126*l So, our simplified equation is -126*l = 1134. Step 2: Solve for l Now, we need to isolate the variable 'l' by dividing both sides of the equation by -126. -126*l = 1134 => l = 1134 / -126 Now, we will find the simplified fraction for 1134/-126. Both 1134 and -126 have a factor of 2 in common: So, 1134 ÷ 2 = 567 and -126 ÷ 2 = -63 So our simplified fraction is: l = 567/-63 Step 3: Simplify the fraction Now, the fraction 567 / -63 can be further simplified as both numbers have a factor of 9 in common. 567 ÷ 9 = 63 and -63 ÷ 9 = -7 So, our solution for l is: l = 63 / -7 => l = -9 Thus, the value of 'l' for the given equation -20*l - 106*l = 1134 is l = -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.\\" correctly answer the question of When did Nigeria get independence?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests\\" does not correctly answer the question of when Nigeria gained independence. The statement discusses the presence of tribalism and regionalism in Nigerian politics, but it does not provide any information about the country's independence. To answer the question, Nigeria gained independence from British rule on October 1, 1960. This date is celebrated annually as Nigeria's Independence Day, marking the end of colonial rule and the beginning of self-governance. The country was initially a British protectorate in the late 19th century and then was later merged with the British colony of Lagos to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914. The process of gaining independence in Nigeria was a gradual one, involving negotiations and constitutional reforms by various Nigerian political leaders, such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Sir Ahmadu Bello, with the British government. Various political parties were formed with the aim of achieving self-governance, and the movement intensified after World War II. In 1946, the Richards Constitution was introduced, bringing about regionalization and laying the groundwork for political representation. This was followed by the Macpherson Constitution in 1951, which established the Central Legislative Council and allowed for greater political representation. The Lyttleton Constitution came into force in 1954, furthering the autonomy of Nigeria's regions while maintaining a federal structure. Finally, in 1959, the Nigerian general elections took place, resulting in the formation of a coalition government under the leadership of prime minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Nigeria subsequently became fully independent on October 1, 1960, with Nnamdi Azikiwe appointed as Governor-General (and later President, when Nigeria became a republic in 1963). While the original statement does not answer the question of when Nigeria gained independence, it does touch upon the ethno-political complexities that continue to shape Nigerian politics today. The country has more than 250 ethnic groups, with the main groups being the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo. This diversity, combined with regional economic imbalances, has contributed to power struggles and calls for regional autonomy, which can, at times, exacerbate tribal tensions in Nigerian politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Publicity offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products. Question: All of the following advantages of publicity are mentioned EXCEPT _ .

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime.

The Goryeo period spanned from 918 to 1392, which allows us to place his contributions within a broader historical context. 3. Date of death: Yi Ui-bang died in December 1174. This fact allows us to further refine our understanding of his life and the events that took place during his lifetime. 4. Occupation: Yi Ui-bang was a military ruler of Korea, indicating that he held a significant position of power and influence, specifically within the realm of military affairs. This suggests that he was involved in organizing and directing the armed forces of Korea during his rule. 5. Nature of rule: The bio describes Yi Ui-bang as a \\"military ruler\\" instead of using a more general term like \\"king\\" or \\"emperor.\\" This suggests that his rule was primarily centered on military matters rather than civil administration or other aspects of governance. 6.

While the bio provides some important details about Yi Ui-bang, it leaves out other key pieces of information. Further research would be needed to learn more about his early life, the specific circumstances that led to him becoming a military ruler, his contributions to military strategy and tactics, his relationships with other significant figures of the time, and any major events or battles that occurred during his rule.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November.

Not of monsters under the bed like any average six-year-old but of everything. Normal, everyday activities prove terrifying to him. He canât communicate his fears or share them with friends, because he canât use language and he has no friends. Kyle has autism, a condition it took his parents two desperate years to get diagnosed. So his day consists of endless traumas and tantrumsâ¦ and unimaginable stress for his mother Nicola (Keeley Hawes). Nicola knows that the one thing Kyle wants is to be left alone, safe and secure in his autistic world. But she also knows that if she grants her son this wish, he will have no future. Her fierce determination to break into Kyleâs world at any cost has placed an intolerable strain on her marriage. Her husband Rob (Ben Miles), although equally unbending in his love for his son, is frustrated by Nicolaâs relentless challenging of Kyle. Not to mention the loss of the carefree life he and Nicola once had. Rob tries everything to convince Nicola that Kyle should go to bruce house school, a boarding school for autistic children.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Various stages of the life cycle of a source program with a neat diagram.? Explain the various stages of the life cycle of a source program with a neat diagram.? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. Both are asking for an explanation of the various stages of the life cycle of a source program, preferably accompanied by a diagram. Here's a detailed explanation of the various stages of a source program's life cycle. **1. Edit**: This is the first stage of the lifecycle. Here, the program code is written or modified using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In an IDE, you can write your code, compile it and run it all in one place. It’s generally a more user-friendly way to write code than is a simple text editor. **2. Preprocess**: This is the second stage of the lifecycle. Preprocessing happens immediately after editing and before compilation. During this stage, the preprocessor, a part of the compiler, takes a source code file and deals with the directives, like #include and #define. These directives order the inclusion of particular files and substitution of tokens in the source code file. **3. Compile**: The next stage is compilation. The source code is translated into assembly code by the compiler. The compiler checks the code for syntactic and semantic errors. If it finds any errors, it will show these errors in a list. You have to debug these errors before you can move on. **4. Assemble**: After the code has been successfully compiled and is error-free, it is then assembled. The assembly code is converted into the object (machine) code. **5. Link**: The code is then linked. All individual blocks of the program that have been compiled and assembled separately are combined together to form a single program. The linker also adds other code necessary for the execution of the program. **6. Load**: The last stage is loading. This is where the linking code is loaded into the memory for execution. This stage also involves dynamic relocation and linking if necessary. **7. Execute**: Finally, the source code, which has been translated into a program, is executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Please note that modern IDE’s can automate most of these steps, allowing developers to go directly from the Edit stage to the Execute stage, seamlessly. This lifecycle is typically depicted in a flowing, left-to-right diagram that clearly illustrates the transition from one phase to the next. Here is a textual representation of a diagram, due to the limitations of text-based communication. \`\`\` Edit -> Preprocess -> Compile -> Assemble -> Link -> Load -> Execute \`\`\` Starting from the left, you move to the right, going through each stage. If errors are encountered during the Compile, Assemble, or Link stage, you go back to the Edit stage to correct your code. Once your code is Load-ed into the memory, it can be Executed and thus, the lifecycle is completed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off. Despite being told by every adult in sight to go indoors, Hiccup hauls out a bolas-shooting cannon he made himself and shoots a dragon out of the night sky. (As assistant to the village blacksmith, Gobber (voice: Craig Ferguson), Hiccup has access to tools and materials and knows how to use them.) The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it's the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can't make himself kill it. Instead he releases it -- whereupon it also refrains from killing Hiccup -- and it flies off through the trees.Hiccup discovers that the dragon (which he eventually calls Toothless because of its retractable teeth) has holed up in a steep-sided valley because it can no longer fly more than a few feet at a time. While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it's missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather. The new fin helps, but Toothless can't control it and inadvertently takes Hiccup for a ride, giving him a clear idea of what's needed to help the dragon fly right. In a series of workshop and test flight scenes, Hiccup builds and perfects a saddle, a control mechanism for the tail fin, and a safety harness.Meanwhile, Hiccup's father Stoick (voice: Gerard Butler) has signed him up for dragon training with Gobber, which is very different from the training he's already doing with Toothless: he's going to learn to fight dragons.

Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure. During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed. He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third. At the general elections of May 1921, he decided not to stand for parliament again, and was made a senator. In spite of his advanced age, he continued to write on economic and financial problems with his accustomed lucidity and soundness of judgment, insisting on the necessity for Italy to return to free trade and to reduce government interference in business matters to a minimum.

Summarize: Abdul (not his full name) suffered a hand injury. He says he escaped after a young Taliban fighter his own age intervened on his behalf. The Taliban have been accused by human rights group Amnesty International of killings and abuses following their capture of Kunduz, the northern city they held for several days last week before Afghan security forces moved in to drive them out. Abdul was on his way home to the northern province of Takhar, after spending his Eid holiday in Kabul. He wanted to return to his studies and ignored warnings the journey would be too dangerous, saying the authorities suggested they were back in control in Kunduz. The route from Kabul to Takhar goes through Kunduz and thousands of people have been stranded in the wake of the fighting. Abdul set off on Sunday, a week after Taliban insurgents took over Kunduz. It was the first time the group had captured a provincial capital since they were ousted from power in 2001. \\"When I took a car, the driver told me not to worry because he knew people with the Taliban,\\" Abdul told the BBC in the interview in Takhar. \\"Throughout the journey, the driver was talking to people who seemed to be Taliban on the phone and assured me that nothing would happen.\\" Abdul still appeared to be traumatised as he recounted what happened next, clutching his arm with his thumb in a thick bandage. He says that when the car entered Kunduz, he saw the Afghan flag on a roundabout but there was no one from the Afghan government in sight, The driver was supposed to take his passengers directly to Takhar - but instead dropped them off on the northern outskirts of the city, where they had to find another vehicle. It was on the way out of the city when Abdul got really worried as the area appeared to be under Taliban control. \\"From then onwards on the road to Takhar there were Talibs everywhere,\\" he recounted. \\"I saw dead bodies along the roadside. They smelled bad. Many looked no more than 20 years old.\\" After passing two roadblocks, the car was stopped and Taliban insurgents began to question the passengers. \\"They asked us what we were doing here, and I said I had been in Kabul for treatment because I was not feeling well.\\" The passengers were taken to a nearby hotel which the Taliban had made their base and where the questioning continued. Abdul, whose account cannot be independently verified, says he was kicked in the back twice and accused of working for the government. \\"I told them I wasn't, but however much I cried and shouted, they would not let me go.\\" He said there was a stream outside where the insurgent group appeared to have a killing ground. He says a man had been beheaded there. Such testimony chimes with a report by Amnesty International last week which spoke of \\"mass murder, gang rapes and house-to-house searches by Taliban death squads\\" in Kunduz, based on civilian accounts collected by the human rights watchdog from people fleeing the city. The Taliban by contrast sent out messages of reassurance, saying that civilians and their property would be respected and there was nothing to fear. Abdul's story contradicts this. He says he himself was then taken outside. \\"They dropped me there and put a knife to my neck. I tried to grab the knife and they cut my finger.\\" Abdul recounts how his friend started crying as soon as the Taliban produced the knife and shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is great\\"). It was then that one of the insurgents, a young man roughly Abdul's age, started to become emotional himself and intervened. \\"He asked me whether I had done anything wrong,\\" Abdul says. \\"I said: 'No.' I told them that I'd do whatever they wanted, that I would even join them because I was so scared.\\" For whatever reason, Abdul was spared and \\"told to go and not look back\\". He says his hand bled all the way to Takhar, where a doctor treated the wound with 10 stitches. \\"Whenever I see a knife now I feel faint,\\" he says. Abdul accuses the authorities of not telling the truth about the security situation in Kunduz. \\"My only advice to the government is: Don't lie, because people will misunderstand and think Kunduz is under control, and that could cost lives.\\" Summary:","completion":"Abdul, a young man from the northern province of Takhar, suffered a hand injury after being stopped by Taliban insurgents while traveling through Kunduz.

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

How do you do this: To remove the peel from a lemon, you can","completion":"To remove the peel from a lemon, you can follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Wash the lemon: First, make sure to rinse the lemon under cold water to remove any dirt, wax, or pesticides that may be present on the surface. 2. Select the right tool: You can use a zester, grater, or a sharp knife (such as a paring knife or vegetable peeler) to remove the lemon peel. 3. Stabilize the lemon: Place the lemon on a cutting board or any flat surface that is slip-resistant. It's helpful to cut a small slice from the top and bottom of the lemon to create a flat surface on both ends for better stability. 4. Gripping the lemon: Hold the lemon firmly with one hand, making sure to have a good grip so that it doesn't move or slip while you're removing the peel. 5. Using the chosen tool: - If using a zester: Hold the zester's handle with the other hand and firmly press the zesting surface against the lemon, dragging it downwards in one continuous motion, removing the outer layer of the peel in thin strips. - If using a grater: Hold the grater by its handle and rub the lemon against the grater's surface, keeping the motion steady. Rotate the lemon as needed to remove the peel evenly. - If using a knife or vegetable peeler: Place the edge of the knife or peeler against the top of the lemon where a flat surface was created, and carefully slide it downwards under the peel, following the curvature of the lemon. Try to remove the peel in long strips while avoiding cutting too deep, as you only want to remove the outer layer (the colored part) and not the white pith underneath. 6. Rotate the lemon: As you remove the peel, rotate the lemon and repeat the process until the entire peel has been removed. 7. Clean up: If there are any small areas of the peel remaining, use the zester, grater, or knife to remove them as needed. 8. Use the lemon peel: Now that the lemon peel has been removed, you can chop it, grate it, or use it in various dishes or drinks as a garnish or flavor enhancer. By following these steps, you can successfully remove the peel from a lemon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Second question: Why was Nepal not colonized by the British, like they did to India? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Hi there little buddy! I'm here to help you understand this history stuff. Let's start with the first question: 1. Why didn't the British invade Nepal during the British Raj in India? The British Raj was a time when Britain ruled over India, like a very big big sister telling her little brother what to do. Now, Nepal is a small country next to India. One day, the British and Nepal had a little fight called the Anglo-Nepalese War. The people of Nepal were great fighters and lived in big mountains which made it very hard for the British to win. So, after a while, they decided to become friends with Nepal instead of trying to make them listen to the British. They made a special friendship agreement called the Sugauli Treaty. Now, for the second question: 2. Why was Nepal not colonized by the British, like they did to India? Colonized means that a big strong country goes to a smaller country and starts ruling it. So, just like before, Britain tried to rule Nepal but found out it was very difficult because of the tough mountain people and the difficult land with lots of mountains. They decided it was better to stay friends with Nepal and signed that friendship agreement we talked about earlier, the Sugauli Treaty. Instead of ruling Nepal, they worked together. So, to answer your last question, yes, both questions are kind of asking the same thing. They both want to know why Britain didn't control Nepal like they did with India. And now you know, it's because the people in Nepal were such great fighters and their land was so difficult to fight in, so the British thought it was better to be friends with them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's Not Golf, But It's Getting There The game of golf has a lot to answer for: complex rules, white belts, high levels of frustration and profanity. But at least when you play, you're out in the elements, interacting with the natural world. \\"The mainstream golf world doesn't grasp the idea that there are a lot of rounds of golf being played indoors,\\" said Bill Bales, the founder and CEO of aboutGolf, one of several companies which design and manufacture golf simulators. \\"They don't count these rounds, but they're wearing golf shoes, using their clubs and balls, having a satisfying experience playing against each other and by themselves.\\" A simulator at Crosswoods Indoor Golf Center in Chandler, Ariz. last week; It was 109 degrees outside. Luke Donald is one of them. Currently ranked 10th in the Official World Golf Ranking, he lives in Chicago and put an aboutGolf simulator in his home a year ago. \\"I use it in the winter as a way to practice, simulate real golf and play some golf courses that we play on tour,\\" he says. \\"You can work the ball left to right and right to left and it's very accurate.\\" That's a pretty good endorsement, and there are other signs of success: the sims are big in Korea and other parts of the Far East, for example. There is a residential market for those who, like Tour pro Mr. Donald, can afford the 50,000-60,000 price tag. But Mr. Bales and his fellow entrepreneurs also have their eye on driving ranges, golf shops, teaching pros, recreational centers, and the occasional bar and grill. \\"I really think we can grow the game of golf beyond the circle of current golfers by creating this thing that is like the game outdoors, but you can do it at night, you can do it for an hour, you can do it without anyone behind you trying to hurry you along,\\" says Mr. Bales. Golf simulators have been around since the early 1970s. They were amusement park novelties, tucked in the back of a retail shop or in a forgotten corner of a golf center. Today, the technology has improved vastly. \\"The hardest thing to do is to convince someone who played in a sim 15 years ago to come and check it out,\\" said Ken Reynolds, whose company, EverGreens Golf, became an aboutGolf dealer after operating an indoor golf center. Those antediluvian machines featured grainy photos of a course projected onto a simple screen; you whacked a ball into the screen, a device measured the time it took for the ball to pass through two points, and after calculating and extrapolating, it told you your distance and transported you to your next location. Today's most advanced simulators put you in a true 3-D environment, as though you've been transported physically into an ultra-high-def video game. Stereoscopic cameras are trained on the hitting zone, where they record club speed, ball speed, launch angle and all components of spin. The flight of the ball, projected into the virtual course in the time it takes the ball to hit the screen, replicates the shot that would result in the outside world with remarkable precision. Full-swing simulators have to serve two distinctly different purposes: entertainment and performance. The entertainment side is on display at the indoor centers that are springing up around the country. For some, golf leagues have taken the place of bowling leagues for an evening's recreation; there are couples' leagues, skins games, match play, all on simulations of great courses around the world. Brad Lefebvre, Chief Development Officer for the Crosswoods Indoor Golf Centers in the Phoenix area, travels with a group of friends who use the simulators to familiarize themselves with places they're planning to play. \\"I can bring a client in and we can play in two hours,\\" says Mr. Lefebvre. His leagues attract golfers looking to avoid the blistering summer heat and occasional winter rains. \\"It's the first time in my business life I pray for bad weather.\\" But it's the performance side where things have changed the most. The old simulators were notorious for simplifying ball flight. The swing that gave you a big drive down the fairway indoors might produce a duck-hook on the course; the machines were useless for serious practice. Today, they provide all the feedback a golfer can handle, with angles and velocities for every shot. Retailers have found them useful for club-fitting. More than 85% of all clubs are purchased at off-site retail outlets, in a process Mr. Bales calls \\"FMWAI,\\" pronounced fim-way. It stands for Five Minutes With An Idiot. An accurate simulator will provide the necessary data for an accurate fitting, even when operated by a temporary employee at a chain store. There's also teaching. \\"We had one kid who didn't hit the ball high enough to get out of chutes and over trees,\\" says Dave Hollinger, men's golf coach at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \\"He worked all winter on getting his ball flight right, and he reached the round of 16 at the U.S. Amateur Public Links championship, and finished seventh at the Canadian Amateur.\\" Then there's self-instruction, perhaps the biggest market of all. Only 10% of golfers take lessons, and if most golfers practice at all they must work on their own. What do simulators do best? On full shots, they deliver a good measure of realism and accuracy. But roughly half the shots in a round of golf are played from within 50 yards of the hole, and it's here that the indoor game requires some large mental adjustments. On touch shots like pitches and chips, golfers generally pick out a target visually and play the ball to that point. On a simulator, you have to play from information instead of what you see. If you're 30 yards from the green, you have to develop the feeling of hitting the ball 30 yards; it becomes a question of muscle memory rather than hand-eye coordination and judgment. The putting elements have improved, but they call for a similar adjustment; you have to learn how softly to stroke an eight-foot putt towards a hole on a screen 25 feet away. The good thing is, we can all use more time practicing eight-foot putts, but it's difficult to hold onto that feeling when you go back outside and face a whole different set of sensory inputs. No simulator can prepare a player for the variety of lies and ground conditions he'll find on the course. Every lie on an artificial mat is level; uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies require knowledge and practice you can't get indoors. Some simulators deduct distance for a shot out of thick rough, but that does little to help you learn how to hit it. The same goes for hitting from the sand. Mr. Bales acknowledges these shortcomings, while enthusing about \\"trajectory physics\\" and \\"aero coefficients.\\" On the company's test range, he is seeking \\"sub-millimeter accuracy in pinpointing the position of a ball in space. When we have all that data, then we'll have the Holy Grail of simulator accuracy.\\" Sportswriter Jeff Neuman is co-author of \\"A Disorderly Compendium of Golf.\\" John Paul Newport is off this week. Email: golfjournal@wsj.com. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the evolution and impact of golf simulators in the sport of golf. It highlights the increasing popularity and acceptance of golf simulators for both professional and recreational use. The Founder and CEO of aboutGolf, a leading golf simulator manufacturer, argued that golf simulators are making the sport more accessible, allowing people to play anytime and anywhere, including indoors. Simulators have greatly improved over time, with cutting-edge technology providing a more accurate and immersive experience. They now use 3D environments and stereoscopic cameras to analyze elements such as club speed, ball speed, launch angle, and spin to replicate a shot's result with remarkable accuracy. Simulators now serve two main purposes: entertainment and performance training. They have created new social opportunities to partake in the sport and also serve as teaching tools for training, club-fitting, and self-instruction, offering valuable feedback on player's stats. However, the article also points out that simulators still have shortcomings. They are unable to replicate the full variety of real-world conditions golfers may encounter on a course, such as different types of lies and ground conditions. The tactile aspect of touch shots and putting also requires mental adjustment when in a simulated environment as compared to a real-world one. Despite these challenges, golf simulators are pushing for the advancement of \\"sub-millimeter accuracy in pinpointing the position of a ball in space,\\" striving to further refine their performance capabilities and accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(CBS4) – A health warning has been sent out to residents of a small town on Colorado’s Eastern Plains: don’t drink the water. The town of Hugo’s public works department said Thursday afternoon the municipal water supply has been found to contain THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. “Earlier this afternoon Hugo Public Works notified Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office that there was evidence of THC in the Town of Hugo’s water supply,” the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office wrote in a Facebook post. So far there’s been no explanation given about how the THC might have come to be present in the water, and it’s not clear how much THC the water may contain. They said the warning is being sent out “out of an abundance of caution” and should be followed for the next 48 hours. Hugo Residents Evidence of THC in town water,Dont drink,shower,or cook w/it.Fresh H20 coming Will advise when it arrives.#HugosWater — Hugo Marshals Office (@HugoMarshals) July 21, 2016 Authorities said residents can still flush toilets with the water but they said not to drink it, shower with it or cook with it. They said supplies of fresh water are being delivered to the community soon. State and federal authorities have been contacted to assist with the investigation into the matter. Hugo is located to the southeast of Limon on Highway 287, approximately 100 miles east and south of Denver. The town has a population of approximately 800 people. Residents were told to call 719-743-2485 with questions about the warning. RELATED STORIES: Marijuana Legalization Story Archive ||||| Related Articles July 23, 2016 Hugo water safe to drink after conclusive tests show no signs of THC HUGO — This town on Colorado’s Eastern Plains warned its residents not to drink, bathe in or cook with its tap water on Thursday because officials said multiple preliminary tests of the water came back positive for THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. Residents were told not even to let their pets drink the water. There have been no reports of illnesses or any symptoms of impairment from drinking the water, officials said at a news conference Thursday evening. Deeper tests, which will not be completed until Saturday, are needed to verify the presence of THC and to determine the level of contamination, if any. “We are checking to make sure this isn’t because of the field test kit — that it isn’t a false positive,” said Capt. Michael Yowell of Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office. But Yowell said there were enough troubling signs for officials to take quick action. Concerns about the water were first raised by a Hugo company using quick “field tests” to check employees for THC, Yowell said. The simple tests are similar in function to home pregnancy tests in that they can return only two results: positive or negative. Yowell said the company, which he did not identify, had been getting inconsistent results and decided to test a vial of tap water, expecting it to be negative. Instead, the test came back positive, and the company called authorities. Yowell said Lincoln County officials conducted 10 other field tests, using two different types of test kits, on the town’s water and six came back positive. Authorities later isolated the positive results to a single well — well No. 1, about a mile south of Hugo’s small downtown. When sheriff’s deputies investigated, Yowell said, they found signs of forced entry at the well, though it is unclear when the damage may have occurred. “I wouldn’t be doing my job for my community if we just wrote this off,” Yowell said. The well has been sealed and secured, but he said it will take time for water to flush through the lines. Agents from the FBI and Colorado Bureau of Investigation are participating in the probe, Yowell said, and a representative from the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office was in Hugo on Thursday to support the investigation, as well. Screening stations are being set up for worried residents, and water is being trucked in. The county’s public health department said the public should avoid the town’s water for at least the next 48 hours and report any effects to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center. Hugo Mayor Tom Lee says he was shocked by news of the possibly tainted water. He said there hasn’t been the kind of acrimonious debate over marijuana in Hugo that there has been in other Colorado communities. “We’ll figure it out,” Lee said. “It just blew my mind.” Hugo Residents Evidence of THC in town water,Dont drink,shower,or cook w/it.Fresh H20 coming Will advise when it arrives.#HugosWater — Hugo Marshals Office (@HugoMarshals) July 21, 2016 Hugo is a Lincoln County town of about 720 people that sits roughly 90 miles east of Colorado Springs and 15 miles southeast of Limon. There are no commercial marijuana operations in Lincoln County. The entire county has only 62 medical marijuana patients, according to the state Health Department.

THC was discovered in the water in Hugo prompting a city and federal investigation. Michael Reaves, The Denver Post Community members look on as Captain Michael Yowell of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office addresses the media on July 21, 2016. THC was discovered in the water in Hugo prompting a city and federal investigation. Mark Salley, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said a state toxicologist is assessing what kind of health effects the potential contamination could have. Salley said — as with marijuana edibles or other products — the impacts would likely vary based on the amount of water consumed and the concentration. But others cast doubt on the dangers of THC-contaminated water or whether it’s even possible to spike tap water with marijuana. “It would take more product than any of us could afford to contaminate a city water supply to the extent that people would suffer any effects,” Dr. John Fox, Lincoln County’s health officer, said in a statement. Peter Perrone, who owns Wheat Ridge cannabis testing facility Gobi Analytical, said cannabinoids such as THC or CBD “are in no way soluble in water.” “There is zero possibility that there’s anything like THC in the Hugo water,” Perrone said. All tests so far on water have been with field test kits. Some have come back negative. Some positive. — John Ingold ☀️ (@johningold) July 22, 2016 “You know how oil and water separate? It’s the same with cannabinoids. They’re lipophilic, which means they’re fat-loving. They would never be soluble in water. In order for people to solubilize these cannabinoids in their drinks, for marijuana products like the Dixie Elixirs sold in dispensaries, it takes a lot of work. It takes so many steps to get a fat-soluble thing like a cannabinoid into something like a drink.” Joseph Evans, a former EPA scientist who now serves as lab director at Denver-based marijuana testing lab Nordic Analytical, agreed. “The one thing that bothers me about this story from a scientific perspective is that THC is so insoluble in water,” Evans said. “I can’t imagine, I can’t even fathom the idea that THC would be in water at any type of solubility to create any kind of health hazard.” A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency said the agency’s support had not been requested as of about 5 p.m. Yowell said authorities in Hugo are aware that THC and water shouldn’t mix. “But when you have a presumptive positive of THC in our water supply, we take that very seriously,” he said.

Bottled water on the way — Lincoln Sheriff (@LincolnCountySO) July 21, 2016 Regardless, Thursday’s announcement upended life in Hugo. The town’s restaurant, Jean’s Family Kitchen, closed because it couldn’t use the water. The soda machines at the Loaf ‘N Jug fell silent. The high school’s 6-man football team had to cancel its summer camp because players couldn’t shower afterward, said Jake McClendon, a fullback and linebacker on the team. “I thought it was a joke at first,” he said. Lucas Hohl, owner of Osborne’s Supermarket, said an influx of customers came in seeking bottled water. Hohl likened the increase in traffic to the “mad rush of sales when a blizzard is coming in.” He added: “We’re trying to reduce the panic as best we can. It sounds like the town is trying to get the situation under control.” Some, like 90-year-old Maye Gene Lee, a former mayor of the town, were angry at the possibility that saboteurs may have struck the town’s water supply. “If I could have gotten my hands on them, I would have taken care of them myself,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to worry about that. And if it happens out here in Hugo, Colo., it can happen any place.” Others, though, greeted the news with a sense of humor. Patsie Smith, another former mayor, said she received a reverse 911-type message shortly after 3 p.m. telling residents not to drink the water because there could be THC in it. She chuckled at the thought. “I might have to go drink some water,” she joked.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who is likely to be the next American woman running for president? Can anyone guide me how to create a Personal Assistant using AI? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address two completely different topics. I will provide detailed answers for each question separately: 1) Who is likely to be the next American woman running for president? It is difficult to predict with certainty who will be the next American woman running for president, as it depends on various factors such as potential candidates' individual decisions, political party nominations, and public opinion. However, several female politicians have been mentioned in the media and political circles as potential presidential candidates for the upcoming elections. Some of these potential candidates include: - Kamala Harris, the current Vice President of the United States, who could potentially run for president after President Joe Biden's term. - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, who has gained a large following since her election in 2018 and has been vocal about progressive policies. - Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who has been an advocate for economic equality and consumer protections and previously ran in the 2020 Democratic primaries. - Nikki Haley, a Republican and former governor of South Carolina, who has experience in the international field having served as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under former President Donald Trump. These are just a few examples, and the political landscape may change significantly before the next presidential election. As a result, it is important to stay informed of any changes or announcements from potential candidates and political parties. 2) Can anyone guide me on how to create a Personal Assistant using AI? Creating a personal assistant using AI requires several steps, including knowledge of programming, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. Here's a general outline of the process: 1. Define the purpose and scope: Clearly define what you want your personal assistant to do and the tasks it should accomplish. This will help you determine the required features and functionality. 2. Choose a platform or framework: There are many AI platforms and frameworks available that can be used for building a personal assistant, such as Google's Dialogflow, Microsoft's Bot Framework, and Rasa. These platforms take care of the backend infrastructure and provide useful tools for developers. 3. Learn programming languages: To create your AI personal assistant, you need to have knowledge of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or another language depending on the platform or framework you choose. 4. Design the conversational flow: Map out the possible conversation paths between the user and your personal assistant. This includes designing intents (what the user wants to do), entities (keywords or parameters to extract from user input), and dialogue flow (how your assistant responds and guides the user). 5. Train the AI model: Use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand user input and learn from conversations as the personal assistant interacts with users. This includes training the model with sample dialogues and constantly refining the conversation paths and responses. 6. Integrate with APIs and external services: Enhance the functionality of your AI personal assistant by connecting it to external services with APIs. This can be beneficial when completing tasks like sending emails, fetching information from databases, or providing personalized recommendations to users. 7. Test and refine: Test your AI personal assistant with real users and analyze the conversation logs to determine weaknesses and shortcomings. Use this data to make improvements and enhancements to the personal assistant's conversational flow and AI model. 8. Deploy your AI personal assistant: Deploy your personal assistant on various platforms, such as messaging apps, websites, and mobile apps, to make it accessible to users. Building a personal assistant using AI is a complex process and may require collaboration with experts in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and user experience design. By following these steps, you can start your journey toward creating a helpful and engaging AI personal assistant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman investigated 158 complaints against the Home Office and agencies last year, and upheld 69% of them. That is more than double the average for the public sector. In one case, a teenage refugee had to wait nearly 10 years before he was allowed to stay. The Home Office said it would consider the report's findings. According to the report, the main problem the watchdog identified with the Home Office concerned immigration casework, where procedural errors, delays and poor decisions meant people had to endure \\"prolonged uncertainty\\". In the case of the 17-year-old asylum seeker, he spent almost a decade without legal status in the UK even though his mother, who had fled her home country, had been allowed to stay permanently. The report said the young man was in \\"administrative limbo\\" because officials continually overlooked his application. He has since received an apology and Â£7,500 in compensation. Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman Julie Mellor said: \\"We have seen far too many cases where people have been separated from their loved ones, unable to work and where their children have been denied access to education. \\"It is the responsibility of every board of every UK government department and agency to recognise the profound impact poor services can have on people's lives and make sure they learn from complaints to improve services for all.\\" Complaints about the NHS form the bulk of the ombudsman's work but it completed 885 investigations into 981 complaints about UK government departments, their agencies and some UK public organisations in 2014-15. Four government departments accounted for 85% of the investigations - the Ministry of Justice, Department for Work and Pensions, Home Office and HM Revenue and Customs. Overall the ombudsman upheld 33% of the complaints investigated. \\"The large proportion of complaints that we upheld about the Home Office can partly be explained by the high volume of old legacy immigration cases they are dealing with,\\" the report said.

That's kind of like what happened with the Home Office, a place in the UK that makes big decisions like who can live there. We know this because there is a group called the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman—who act a bit like a school principal—who checked on the Home Office about how well they were doing their job. They looked over 158 times people said the Home Office did something wrong, and found that 69% of the time, the complaints were right. One of those times was about a teenage boy who came from another country to be safe, but had to wait about 10 years before he was allowed to stay, even though his mom was already allowed to. The Ombudsman said that the Home Office made too many mistakes and took too long to make decisions, which isn't fair to people like the boy who had to wait a very long time. The Home Office has said sorry to the boy and given him some money to say sorry for their mistake. This group also checks on other big departments that are like the Home Office, and usually people are unhappy with how well they're doing their job about 33% of the time. But for the Home Office, people were unhappy about 69% of the time which is quite a lot more.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who the used very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies? After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Paragraph: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Relaxation\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Perception of Scenic Beauty: Driving along a scenic highway allows individuals to appreciate the beauty of nature and picturesque landscapes. Humans often find nature soothing, and the immersive experience of scenic surroundings can evoke pleasant emotions and a sense of relaxation. 2. Distraction from Stressful Thoughts: A scenic drive can provide a much-needed distraction from daily stressors, allowing the mind to focus on the present and appreciate the calm, peaceful environment around them resulting in relaxation. 3.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are the duties of the speaker of Lok Sabha and who is the best speaker so far? Can the Prime Minister of India be a speaker of the Lok Sabha? Options: [1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"[1]. no These questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is a two-part query that asks about the duties of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and also inquires about the best Speaker to have held the position so far. The second question, on the other hand, is focused on the possibility of the Prime Minister of India taking up the role of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Let's break down the two questions to better understand their meaning. First question: What are the duties of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, and who is the best speaker so far? The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is an essential part of the Indian Parliament, serving as the representative and chief authority of the House. The primary duties of the Speaker are as follows: 1. Presiding over the sittings of the Lok Sabha and maintaining decorum and order in the House. 2. Deciding on procedural matters, points of order, and interpretations of the rules of procedure. 3. Referring bills, motions, and other matters to the relevant parliamentary committees for detailed examination. 4. Casting a deciding vote in case of a tie on any matter under discussion in the House. 5. Representing the Lok Sabha in its relations with the President of India, the Rajya Sabha, and other authorities or individuals. 6. Certifying money bills and providing assent on behalf of the Lok Sabha. 7. Safeguarding the rights and privileges of the members of the House. As for the best Speaker so far, this is a subjective topic and different individuals may have varying opinions based on their assessment of effectiveness, impartiality, and other factors. However, some notable Speakers of the Lok Sabha in the past include G.V. Mavalankar (the first Speaker of independent India), P.A. Sangma, Meira Kumar, and Sumitra Mahajan. Second question: Can the Prime Minister of India be a speaker of the Lok Sabha? Technically, the Prime Minister of India can be elected as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the Constitution does not impose any specific restriction on who can be chosen for this role. However, convention and the practicalities of governance make this possibility highly unlikely. The Prime Minister holds the executive responsibility of running the government and developing and implementing policies, whereas the Speaker is responsible for presiding over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and ensuring the smooth functioning of the legislature. Combining these two critical and distinct roles would likely lead to a conflict of interest and impede the effective separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches of government. In reality, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are always two different individuals, each focusing on their respective responsibilities within the Indian polity. Therefore, while there is no explicit constitutional or legal prohibition, historical precedent and practical concerns make it improbable for the Prime Minister of India to also serve as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

Write a summary based on this article: The search is finally over. The deadly cobra that escaped from the Bronx Zoo on Saturday is back in custody, zoo officials said today. The highly venomous 20-inch-long snake escaped from its habitat, with zoo officials saying it was hiding out somewhere inside the Reptile House, which had remained closed since the weekend. The snake was found at about 9 a.m. after it was lured out by the smell of rodents that had been there by zoo workers, officials said. “As you can imagine, we are delighted to report that the snake has been found alive and well,” said Jim Breheny, director of the Bronx Zoo. “I really want to thank our staff for their determination and professionalism as we conducted the methodical search. We appreciated the public’s support throughout the past week and we thank the media for helping keep the public informed.” The brownish cobra — with a uniquely large, broad head — is among the most venomous reptiles on the planet — its poison can kill a person in fewer than 15 minutes. Zoo officials said no one was fired as a result of the incident. The missing snake became international news in recent days. A prankster seized upon the tale to create a fake Twitter account called @bronxzooscobra, quickly garnering nearly 200,000 followers. The Twitter “cobra” refused to concede that it had been caught. Around 2:10 p.m. it tweeted, “If you see a bag of peanuts inexplicably moving along the ground at Yankee Stadium today. Just ignore it. It’s probably nothing.” Zoo officials had resorted to using traps baited with live rats to try to capture it. With Newscore ||||| Bronx Zoo deadly escaped Egyptian Cobra is found alive after 6 days on the lam Julie Larsen Maher First photo! The Bronx Zoo cobra is captured after six days missing. The hisssssteria is over: The Bronx Zoo cobra was caught Thursday, less than 100 feet from the cage it somehow escaped six days earlier. \\"We found our snake and we're very happy,\\" the zoo's relieved director, Jim Breheny, told the Daily News on Thursday. The fanged former fugitive is world-famous but has no name - so the zoo and the Daily News are teaming up to sponsor a contest, with details to be announced soon. The venomous Egyptian cobra was spotted coiled in a corner of the Reptile House around 9 a.m., during one of three daily sweeps by a half-dozen zoo workers. \\"We always thought she'd be in a dark quiet place and that's where she was,\\" Breheny said. Using special tongs and hooks, staffers easily apprehended her. \\"We knew it was going to be a game of patience,\\" Breheny said. \\"We set the place up to make it easier to search.\\" The zoo, which is run by the Wildlife Conservation Society, didn't leave out any mice-baited traps but kept the area dark and quiet, and scattered rodent-scented wood shavings. \\"We wanted to just let her feel comfortable,\\" Breheny said. \\"We did everything we could to help her feel secure.\\" Zoo officials believe the serpent slipped out of a fiberglass box with a sliding glass front on Friday while no one was around. \\"Clearly she finagled her way out of the enclosure,\\" Breheny said. \\"We've begun a review to see if we can piece together what happened. \\"We have not changed our protocol but double-checked existing protocol and have people double-checking each other,\\" he said. Zoo officials plan to reopen the Reptile House soon, and the clever cobra will go on exhibit after getting a clean bill of health. \\"She looks in really good condition,\\" Breheny said. The cold-blooded Houdini should be a big draw. Her vanishing act made headlines across the globe, provided fodder for late-night comedians, and prompted both anxiety and amusement from New Yorkers. An anonymous wit even created a Twitter feed chronicling the reptile's madeup misadventures - and picked up over 200,000 followers, from Mayor Bloomberg to Ellen DeGeneres. All along, zoo officials said they were confident the 20-inch-long adolescent was still somewhere in the Reptile House, not roaming the city. Cobras can be deadly. The Egyptian's bite will shut down a human respiratory system if left untreated. But Breheny downplayed the potential danger to the public. \\"Snakes in general are shy, secretive creatures. If the snake had a choice between fight or flight, it would definitely avoid people,\\" he said. Now that the elusive animal has been found, she is under close observation. \\"She's resting comfortably - and secure,\\" he promised. bpaddock@nydailynews.com |||||","completion":"A highly venomous cobra that escaped from the Bronx Zoo has been found and captured, after being on the loose for six days.

Title: The Descent Movie plot: On her way back from whitewater rafting with her friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid), Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), along with her husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) get involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives. One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam (MyAnna Buring), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), and newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. While spelunking, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. As the group moves through a passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits she led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system like they originally planned, and that rescue is impossible because of this. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her.

Input: By Charley AdamsBBC News There has been a \\"massive disruption\\" to children's activity levels - before the virus, on average almost 47% of children were active for 60 minutes a day, which has fallen to 19%, explained Mike Diaper from Sport England. \\"It is important to help our children get active,\\" said Mr Diaper, the organisation's executive director of children and young people. \\"It will help them deal with the stresses and strains of these difficult days.\\" He said it had been great to see schools running virtual sports days to encourage children to remain active. Youth Sport Trust, which organised a National School Sport Week at Home in June, said: \\"We wanted to ensure young people still felt that sense of fun they get from school sports days and that sports days do not get cancelled completely this year.\\" So what have pupils been up to while abiding by lockdown rules? PE teachers in Blackburn have been setting the students a \\"beat the teacher\\" challenge each day for the pupils to do at home. The students then send in their scores to compare to the teachers' results. Hollie Southward, one of the PE teachers, said they were activities suited for the home. Noah in year 7 took on a speed bounce challenge to see how many bounces he could do over a broom in 30 seconds and also competed in an obstacle course. Priestley Smith School in Birmingham, a specialist school for vision impaired pupils, got children to try tea bag throwing and teachers read a sport-themed bed time story to pupils, explained Chloe Manley. Some pupils have not been back at school for weeks so it was an ideal opportunity to engage with the children at school and at home, added Mrs Manley. The PE lead at St Breock Primary School in Wadebridge, said a sports week helped the children at home \\"connect with us at school\\". When they told the children about the plans \\"the excitement was unbelievable\\", said James Ross from Cornwall. Children at school and home competed in similar activities with those taking part in school all having separate PE equipment bags to keep them safe. In Kent, a reception class has been practicing a socially distanced egg and spoon race ahead of a full school sports event. Pupils at Valley Invicta Primary School will be able to earn points for their house before the winner is announced at the end of the week. The sports day activities have been designed to abide by social distancing rules. Pupils in Edinburgh have been trying home high jumping with toilets rolls and tennis ball and spoon races. \\"We ensured that all events could be completed in any space that families had available and that any items of equipment needed were easily found in any house,\\" explained PE and sport director Mike Leonard, from George Watson's College. The teachers recorded some events alongside the school mascot, Rex, for the pupils to try at home, aiming to make the day as inclusive and fun as possible. Teachers in Cornwall have been preparing challenges for their students to try at home, such as toilet roll keepy uppies and tea bag throwing. PE director at Mounts Bay Academy, Ian Veal, said they were avoiding traditional sports day activities to \\"hopefully include all pupils\\" and not exclude any without equipment at home. After all the tutor groups have completed the sports day activities, the PE department will add up the scores and announce the winners. In Sheffield, Tajman had \\"great fun\\" taking part in her first sports day, including doing an obstacle course in the garden. The four-year-old's father said they had been \\"keeping her active\\" during lockdown with lots of different activities outside. Girls High School Sheffield asked its pupils to carry out five different activities. Head of PE Steve Wareham said: \\"As soon as we knew sports day was going to be missed this year, my PE team were really keen to try and do something.\\" The staff at Chelmer Valley High School in Essex made sure all the activities could be done individually and easily at home, such as speed bouncing, sock throwing and chair squatting.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What singer recorded the song \\"Go Now\\" before Denny Laine with Moody Blues? A:","completion":"The song \\"Go Now\\" was originally recorded by an American R&B singer named Bessie Banks before Denny Laine and the Moody Blues made it popular. Bessie Banks, born Bessie White on February 8, 1938, in North Carolina, recorded \\"Go Now\\" in 1964 as a soulful ballad. The song was written by her husband Larry Banks, who was a singer, record producer, and songwriter, in collaboration with Milton Bennett. Bessie Banks' version of \\"Go Now\\" was released under the independent record label, Leiber & Stoller's Tiger Records, in late 1964. The song quickly garnered success and began climbing the R&B charts in the United States. Her heartwarming and powerful vocal performance on \\"Go Now\\" showcased her talent, but the song's fame was short-lived due to the quick rise of the Moody Blues' rendition soon after. Denny Laine, the English musician known for his involvement in the Moody Blues and later with Wings, recorded his version of \\"Go Now\\" alongside the Moody Blues in 1964, around the same time Bessie Banks' version was released. Their rendition of the song was rock-oriented, reflecting the British beat movement popular at the time. The Moody Blues' version became part of their debut album, \\"The Magnificent Moodies,\\" which was released in 1965. Capitalizing on the British Invasion in America, the Moody Blues' \\"Go Now\\" became a hit not only in the United Kingdom, where it reached number one on the charts, but also in the United States, where it peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. This newfound success overshadowed Bessie Banks' original rendition and made the song synonymous with the Moody Blues and Denny Laine, despite Bessie Banks being the first artist to record it. Throughout her career, Bessie Banks recorded other notable singles such as \\"It Sounds Like My Baby\\" and \\"Do It Now,\\" but none reached the same level of success as her original \\"Go Now\\" recording. Despite the overshadowing of her version, Bessie Banks' \\"Go Now\\" remains a significant piece of music history as it provided a foundation for the influential British rock band, the Moody Blues, and served as a testament to the importance of American soul music as an inspiration for the British Invasion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is why the condition is commonly known as \\"lockjaw.\\" Symptoms usually set in about eight days after infection, although the onset has been known to range from three days to three weeks. A shorter incubation period signals a more heavily infected wound. Also, tetanus-infected wounds take longer to incubate when they are father from the central nervous system. Seek urgent treatment if you experience tetanus symptoms within fewer than eight days of exposure. On their own, a headache and a slightly stiff jaw should not terrify you. This could mean a lot of things. However, it wouldn't hurt to check with a doctor if you're worried. As tetanus worsens, you'll experience a stiff neck, and you'll have trouble swallowing.

Sweating and fever Irregular breathing and heartbeat Advanced cases of tetanus can severely impair your breathing with spasms in your throat and vocal cords – and these spasms can cause fractures and muscle tears. Muscular stiffness may cause the spine and other long bones to fracture. You may experience high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Untreated tetanus can cause pneumonia, blood clots in the lungs, and even a coma. Despite the innovations of modern treatment, 10-30% of tetanus patients die from the condition.

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

In this premise, the key components include: 1. The convent being characterized by its splendor. 2. The theatrical granite stairway serving as the first view of the convent. 3. 17th-century frescoes being a part of the stairway's design, contributing to its splendor. Hypothesis: Visitors' first views of the convent's squalor begin with the rotten wooden stairway. In the hypothesis, the key components are: 1. The convent being characterized by its squalor. 2. The rotten wooden stairway serving as the first view of the convent. This comparison reveals that the conditions in the premise and hypothesis are in direct contrast. The premise discusses a convent with a high degree of grandeur, while the hypothesis depicts a deteriorating, impoverished setting. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. Furthermore, the fundamental basis of the two statements is built on contrasting notions: splendor and squalor, which involve opposing and distinctive aspects of the described convent. If the premise is accepted as true, the existence of a grand and richly decorated stairway act as a symbol of the convent's magnificence, refuting any claims of squalor presented in the hypothesis. Similarly, if the hypothesis is accepted as true, it negates the premise by presenting a picture of decay, as opposed to the luxurious atmosphere depicted in the original statement. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis present conflicting images of the convent in question, and the truth of one does not imply the truth of the other.

By reducing the water content in the food, it becomes a less hospitable environment for bacteria and other microorganisms, which helps extend the food's shelf life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"Two men, one wearing jeans and a green shirt and the other wearing all black, dancing on a wood floor.\\", is the sentence \\"There are two men in tuxedos.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the given sentence, \\"Two men, one wearing jeans and a green shirt and the other wearing all black, dancing on a wood floor,\\" the statement \\"There are two men in tuxedos\\" is NOT a true sentence. To provide a more detailed evaluation of this, let's analyze the original sentence and the provided statement separately. Original Sentence: 1. There are two men involved in the scenario. 2. The first man is wearing jeans and a green shirt. 3. The second man is wearing all black. 4. Both men are dancing on a wood floor. The original sentence clearly describes the attire of each man, and there is no mention of them wearing tuxedos. Provided Statement: \\"There are two men in tuxedos.\\" 1. The statement talks about two men, which is consistent with the original sentence. 2. It states that both men are wearing tuxedos. Considering the information from the original sentence and provided statement, the original sentence explicitly states what each man is wearing. If we compare the attire described in both sentences, there are clear discrepancies. In the original sentence, one man is wearing jeans and a green shirt, while the other is wearing all black. While it is possible for one man to wear an all-black tuxedo, the first man's attire (jeans and a green shirt) does not align with the tuxedo requirement. Hence, the statement \\"There are two men in tuxedos\\" is not a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Supreme Court voiced deep free speech concerns Tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty. Selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute. The justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decade-old statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals. But media groups and the National Rifle Association were among those who say the law is overly broad. \\"It's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts,\\" said Justice Antonin Scalia. \\"One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say: You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, movies cannot be made\\" showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused, for example. \\"What about people who like to see human sacrifices?\\" asked Justice Samuel Alito, somewhat sarcastically. \\"Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay-per-view, you know, on the Human Sacrifice Channel. They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?\\" He seemed to indicate strongly it was not, and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. Watch an excerpt of the tapes ». A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his \\"Dogs of Velvet and Steel\\" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in \\"Sporting Dog Journal,\\" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was \\"Catch Dogs,\\" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a \\"gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,\\" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, \\"research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty.\\" Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. Several media organizations have come out in support of Stevens, worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bull-fighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. A number of justices too had concerns, raising a number of hypotheticals, a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated. \\"Why not do a simpler thing?\\" suggested Justice Stephen Breyer. \\"Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done.\\" \\"You have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited,\\" said Chief Justice John Roberts. \\"How can you tell these aren't political videos? With organizations like PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it?\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the distinction between Stevens' videos and news items. \\"Tell me what the difference is between these videos and [filmmaker] David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit,\\" she said. Roma's 2006 independent film \\"Off the Chain\\" consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage. Among the wide-ranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cock fighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the Justice Department, said the law was \\"narrowly targeted\\" and had exceptions specifically for \\"religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\\" \\"This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty,\\" said Katyal. Justice Samuel Alito appeared most supportive of the government's views. He asked about selling of so-called \\"crush\\" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. \\"The people who produce 'crush' videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is sexually exciting,\\" he said, clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. When Stevens' lawyer Patricia Millett launched into a caveat-laden answer, Alito broke in. \\"You are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited?\\" he asked. \\"Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted.\\" Congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of \\"crush\\" videos. The Humane Society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed. Millett said \\"Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area.\\" She noted that if the law is upheld, it would only be the second time the Supreme Court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. \\"The problem in this case, was that Congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our Constitution upside down,\\" Millett told reporters later. The government had argued a \\"compelling interest\\" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. The case is U.S. vs. Stevens (08-769) and a ruling is expected in several months.

But reactions to the addition have been mixed, with some asserting that it is an 'awkward' invasion of privacy. An invasion of privacy? A new Facebook button that lets you ask friends if they're single or taken has been branded 'invasive' and 'naggy' Over-sharing: The 'ask' button appears on the profiles of users who have left their relationship status blank, and includes a note section to explain why you're inquiring about their status. Once you send your 'ask' request, the friend receives a notification that says: 'Hello! I am wondering about your relationship!' They can either ignore it or respond with an answer, with the option of sending it back to you directly or sharing it with the general public. While the social media site has had an option to 'ask' for a friend's phone number, address and e-mail for some months now, the relationship status 'ask' button is a new development - and not everyone is happy about it. One person wrote on Twitter: 'If Facebook wasn't already the biggest invasion of privacy, you can now \\"ask\\" people about their relationship status.' Others called it 'naggy' and questioned its necessity, with one person writing: 'How awkward is that Facebook devoted a single button to ask your friends why they're single?' Even more people have asserted that the button is just another move Facebook has taken to exploit users' private information. 'How awkward is that Facebook devoted a single button to ask your friends why they're single?' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained this company ethos in an 2010 interview. 'People. have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and. different kinds, but more openly and with more people,' he said. 'We. view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be. updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms. are.' But despite the negative reactions, some users have taken the view that the button provides an easy way for singletons to express their interest in one another.

The move comes after a number of yellow cabbies who had painted their cars black in order to work for Uber are now regretting making the switch.

However, many drivers have faced a decline in earnings due to market saturation and increased competition as more individuals sign up to be Uber drivers. Yellow taxi advocates argue that these drivers may find more stability and fare guarantees working under the traditional taxi system. The pilot program's success will ultimately depend on whether yellow taxis can regain their competitive edge in the highly dynamic transportation landscape of New York City. The Taxi and Limousine Commission's decision to launch the pilot program aims to address some of the concerns raised by both yellow taxi drivers and Uber drivers, seeking to establish a healthier balance between the two major players in the New York transport industry. Under this program, drivers will have the opportunity to shift back to yellow taxi operations, thus potentially alleviating the oversaturation of Uber drivers. Additionally, the conversion of black cars into yellow taxis may introduce more cabs onto the streets of New York, reducing wait times and improving overall availability. Towards the end of the pilot program, the Taxi and Limousine Commission must evaluate the results to determine if the program improved the working conditions for drivers, their earnings, and customer satisfaction. The outcomes of this evaluation will be crucial in deciding the next steps for the city's transportation landscape. If the program is successful, it may pave the way for more robust cooperation and a deeper integration between ridesharing platforms and the traditional taxi industry. As a result, New York City's streets could witness a new chapter in transportation history, where yellow taxis and ridesharing services coexist and even complement one another in better serving their passengers. In conclusion, the pilot program enabling the conversion of black cars into yellow taxis aims to address some key issues plaguing the city's transportation network, such as driver working conditions and overall market competition. As New York City continues to grow and evolve, initiatives like this one could facilitate a smoother relationship between the traditional taxi system and ridesharing services like Uber, creating a more efficient and effective transportation system for both drivers and passengers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... Question: what are the factors that make one a refugee Answer: Options are: 1). a foreigner 2). not enough information 3). persecuted person 4). person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons Answer:","completion":"There are several factors that make one a refugee, as defined by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention. To be considered a refugee, a person must fit the following criteria: 1. Well-founded fear of persecution: A refugee is someone who has a genuine and legitimate fear of being persecuted in their home country. Persecution can be based on various reasons, including race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The fear of persecution must be well-founded and not based on mere speculation or personal apprehension. 2. Outside the country of nationality: A refugee is someone who is outside their country of nationality or habitual residence due to the fear of persecution. This requirement is essential because it distinguishes refugees from internally displaced persons, who are also fleeing from persecution or violence within their home country but have not crossed international borders. 3. Inability or unwillingness to avail protection of the home country: A refugee is someone who is either unable or unwilling to seek protection from their home country due to the fear of persecution. This inability or unwillingness may be because the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection, or the person may fear that seeking protection will result in further persecution or harm. Based on the context provided above, the correct answer among the options would be: 3). persecuted person. This answer aligns with the United Nation's definition of a refugee, as a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution and is outside their country of nationality or habitual residence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are crossing using a platform, hold on to the rails provided. If you are getting onto the boat off a jetty or via wading, hold on to the boat itself. When boarding a small boat, it is essential to maintain balance and control over your body movements to ensure your safety and the boat's stability. Using available handrails or holding onto the boat itself can significantly reduce the risk of slipping, falling, or capsizing the vessel. As you board the boat, be mindful of your footing and the surface you are stepping on, as it may be slippery or wet. Furthermore, while boarding, make sure to stow any loose items or gear securely to prevent them from shifting or falling overboard. If you need to transfer some belongings to the boat, do so carefully, and ask for assistance if necessary, as attempting to do it alone can lead to mishaps or accidents. Once aboard, familiarize yourself with the boat's layout and any safety equipment readily available, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and other emergency gear. It is essential to know their location and how to use them in case of an emergency. Additionally, take note of the boat's seating arrangement and be aware of weight distribution to avoid causing the boat to list or become unbalanced. Lastly, always pay close attention and follow any instructions given by the boat's crew or captain, as they are responsible for the overall safety of the vessel and its occupants. They should provide necessary guidance on proper boarding procedures, seating arrangements, and safety guidelines while on water. In summary, when boarding a small boat, make use of available handrails or hold onto the boat, stow gear securely, familiarize yourself with the vessel's layout and safety equipment, and follow any instructions given by the crew or captain to ensure a safe and enjoyable boating experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. and the situation: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. Answer the following question: Aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of which area is less at risk of dying? Answer:","completion":"Aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of Montreal is less at risk of dying. This is because there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. The decreased sulfur oxides emissions result in lower chances of acid rain formation, thus reducing the risk to aquatic life. On the other hand, Beijing has opened several new coal-fired power plants, which release sulfur oxides contributing to air pollution and increasing the risk of acid rain. Consequently, aquatic life in Beijing's freshwater habitats may face a higher risk of dying due to the potential for more acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you neglect your teeth, you have a higher risk of developing tooth abscesses. If you constantly eat foods high in sugar (e.g. candy, chocolate), you can increase your risk for cavities. Cavities can lead eventually to abscesses. Some sugary foods are fine but eat them in moderation. If possible, brush afterwards. If you have an untreated cavity or a tooth fracture that reaches the dental pulp (inner part of your tooth), you risk developing an abscess. This happens when bacteria reaches your dental pulp, which is the inside of your tooth. See a dentist as soon as possible, and watch for any symptoms. Cavities and trauma typically lead to a “periapical abscess.” An injury to the gums can cause an abscess. Gum disease causes the space between the tooth and the gum to widen, which allows bacteria to enter. This bacteria can cause an abscess, even if the teeth are healthy and cavity-free. If you have any issues with your gums, watch for symptoms of an abscess. Gum injuries and gum disease typically lead to a particular kind of infection known as a “gingival abscess” (or “gum abscess”). If the infection extends to the gum pockets, and the draining of pus is blocked by the swallowed gum, it is then called a “periodontal abscess.” Summary:","completion":"To prevent tooth abscesses, it is essential to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice daily and flossing once daily.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the fifteen-year-old who auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing? from the following article ? In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle.

Article: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2013 James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman, Thomas C. Südhof Share this: English Swedish Press Release 2013-10-07 The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet has today decided to award The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof for their discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a major transport system in our cells Summary The 2013 Nobel Prize honours three scientists who have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system. Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three Nobel Laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time in the cell. Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. James Rothman unravelled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. Thomas Südhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision. Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and Südhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders. How cargo is transported in the cell In a large and busy port, systems are required to ensure that the correct cargo is shipped to the correct destination at the right time. The cell, with its different compartments called organelles, faces a similar problem: cells produce molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines and enzymes that have to be delivered to other places inside the cell, or exported out of the cell, at exactly the right moment. Timing and location are everything. Miniature bubble-like vesicles, surrounded by membranes, shuttle the cargo between organelles or fuse with the outer membrane of the cell and release their cargo to the outside. This is of major importance, as it triggers nerve activation in the case of transmitter substances, or controls metabolism in the case of hormones. How do these vesicles know where and when to deliver their cargo? Traffic congestion reveals genetic controllers Randy Schekman was fascinated by how the cell organizes its transport system and in the 1970s decided to study its genetic basis by using yeast as a model system. In a genetic screen, he identified yeast cells with defective transport machinery, giving rise to a situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system. Vesicles piled up in certain parts of the cell. He found that the cause of this congestion was genetic and went on to identify the mutated genes. Schekman identified three classes of genes that control different facets of the cell´s transport system, thereby providing new insights into the tightly regulated machinery that mediates vesicle transport in the cell. Docking with precision James Rothman was also intrigued by the nature of the cell´s transport system. When studying vesicle transport in mammalian cells in the 1980s and 1990s, Rothman discovered that a protein complex enables vesicles to dock and fuse with their target membranes. In the fusion process, proteins on the vesicles and target membranes bind to each other like the two sides of a zipper. The fact that there are many such proteins and that they bind only in specific combinations ensures that cargo is delivered to a precise location. The same principle operates inside the cell and when a vesicle binds to the cell´s outer membrane to release its contents. It turned out that some of the genes Schekman had discovered in yeast coded for proteins corresponding to those Rothman identified in mammals, revealing an ancient evolutionary origin of the transport system. Collectively, they mapped critical components of the cell´s transport machinery. Timing is everything Thomas Südhof was interested in how nerve cells communicate with one another in the brain. The signalling molecules, neurotransmitters, are released from vesicles that fuse with the outer membrane of nerve cells by using the machinery discovered by Rothman and Schekman. But these vesicles are only allowed to release their contents when the nerve cell signals to its neighbours. How is this release controlled in such a precise manner? Calcium ions were known to be involved in this process and in the 1990s, Südhof searched for calcium sensitive proteins in nerve cells. He identified molecular machinery that responds to an influx of calcium ions and directs neighbour proteins rapidly to bind vesicles to the outer membrane of the nerve cell. The zipper opens up and signal substances are released. Südhof´s discovery explained how temporal precision is achieved and how vesicles´ contents can be released on command. Vesicle transport gives insight into disease processes The three Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental process in cell physiology. These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell. Vesicle transport and fusion operate, with the same general principles, in organisms as different as yeast and man. The system is critical for a variety of physiological processes in which vesicle fusion must be controlled, ranging from signalling in the brain to release of hormones and immune cytokines. Defective vesicle transport occurs in a variety of diseases including a number of neurological and immunological disorders, as well as in diabetes. Without this wonderfully precise organization, the cell would lapse into chaos. James E. Rothman was born 1950 in Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA. He received his PhD from Harvard Medical School in 1976, was a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and moved in 1978 to Stanford University in California, where he started his research on the vesicles of the cell. Rothman has also worked at Princeton University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute and Columbia University. In 2008, he joined the faculty of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, where he is currently Professor and Chairman in the Department of Cell Biology. Randy W. Schekman was born 1948 in St Paul, Minnesota, USA, studied at the University of California in Los Angeles and at Stanford University, where he obtained his PhD in 1974 under the supervision of Arthur Kornberg (Nobel Prize 1959) and in the same department that Rothman joined a few years later. In 1976, Schekman joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, where he is currently Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell biology. Schekman is also an investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Thomas C. Südhof was born in 1955 in Göttingen, Germany. He studied at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, where he received an MD in 1982 and a Doctorate in neurochemistry the same year. In 1983, he moved to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, USA, as a postdoctoral fellow with Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein (who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). Südhof became an investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1991 and was appointed Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at Stanford University in 2008.

This cellular machinery, which has evolved over a billion years, is so sensitive that slight malfunctions in the mechanism can cause serious illness or death. \\"Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and Suedhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo,\\" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said in a statement when awarding the prize of 8 million crowns (1.2 million). Their research on how cells transport material around sheds light on how insulin, which controls blood sugar levels, is made and released into the blood at the right place at the right time. Diabetes and some brain disorders have been attributed at least in part to defects in the vesicle transport systems. The scientists' work explains an \\"absolutely essential\\" component of cell biology that helps scientists understand how the brain or hormone secretion works, said Dr. Jeremy Berg, who for years worked as director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a part of the National Institutes of Health, which underwrote much of the research. \\"It's one of the prizes for which there is not a treatment that came out of it directly, but there are probably literally thousands of laboratories around the world whose work would not be taking place the way it is without their work,\\" said Berg, who is director of the Institute for Personalized Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. The Nobel committee said the work could help in understanding immuno-deficiency and brain disorders such as autism. \\"HOW CELLS WORK\\" \\"Their discoveries could perhaps have clinical implications in psychiatric diseases, but my guess is that they will be more useful for the understanding of how cells work,\\" said Professor Patrik Rorsman of Oxford University. Schekman, a geneticist, first became interested in how proteins move within cells in 1974. At the University of California, Berkeley, he began working on yeast, a single cell microorganism. Research showed his findings applied equally to human cells. Among Schekman's research aims is to study whether the accumulation of the protein amyloid in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients is due to disruption of the vesicle system. Suedhof, a neuroscientist, has focused particularly on the brain and questions of human thought and perception, emotions and actions determined by signaling between neurons, cells which constitute the foundation of the nervous system. \\"My major interest is in trying to understand how neurons in the brain communicate - how these processes get established during development, and how they become impaired in autism and schizophrenia,\\" Suedhof said in an interview. Suedhof said the work was really about \\"cell traffic,\\" the ability of cells to move material around. Medicine is the first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year. Prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. \\"My first reaction was, \`Oh, my god!\`\\" said Schekman, who was woken with the good news. \\"That was also my second reaction,\\" he added, according to a University of California, Berkeley, statement. Schekman said in an interview that his work was born out of a desire to understand how it was possible for one cell to talk to the other. He said figuring that out would help deepen understanding of how the brain works, \\"one of the most important questions in biology today.\\" Suedhof said while he and his fellow prize winners had worked separately they had met each other \\"many, many times.\\" They had \\"argued and sometimes agreed and sometimes disagreed,\\" he said with a laugh.

The Nobel committee said their research on \\"vesicle traffic\\" _ the transport system of our cells _ helped scientists understand how \\"cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time\\" inside cells. \\"Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes and immunological disorders,\\" the committee said. Rothman is a professor at Yale University while Schekman is at the University of California, Berkeley. Suedhof joined Stanford University in 2008. The medicine prize kicked off this year's Nobel announcements. The awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics will be announced by other prize juries this week and next.

I chose a Friday evening to visit the restaurant with family, and from the moment we stepped in, we were enveloped in the warm embrace of a truly elegant ambiance. As we were escorted to our reserved table, we couldn't help but notice the impressive and unique décor, reflecting the perfect blend of contemporary and traditional styles. The soft lighting, combined with tastefully chosen art pieces, added to the cozy and welcoming atmosphere that left us all eagerly anticipating the culinary journey ahead. What really stood out for us at Luscious Bites was their impeccable customer service. Our server, Samantha, was truly the epitome of professionalism, paying close attention to our needs while showcasing a genuine interest in ensuring that we had an enjoyable evening. Her knowledge of the menu, as well as her ability to make personalized recommendations based on our individual tastes, was second to none.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: A man walks past an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index and other country's index at a securities firm in Tokyo Monday, Sept. 3, 2018. Asian shares were mostly lower Monday amid worries about escalating trade friction between the U.S. and Canada, who have been unable to agree to a revamped trade deal but will continue negotiating this week. Eugene Hoshiko AP Photo Hypothesis: The Nikkei 25 will remain stable for the foreseeable future.","completion":"Based on the context provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the Nikkei 225 will remain stable for the foreseeable future. First, it's important to note that the context only provides a snapshot of a particular day (September 3, 2018) and does not offer comprehensive information about the stock market or the factors that contribute to the performance of the Nikkei 225 index. Furthermore, the context states that Asian shares were mostly lower on that day due to escalating trade friction between the U.S. and Canada, and that the two countries have not yet come to a revised trade agreement. Thus, the political and economic uncertainty may have a bearing on the Nikkei 225 and other financial indices. Second, the stability of the Nikkei 225 is influenced by a multitude of factors, including domestic and international political developments, economic indicators, corporate performance, technological advancements, and investor sentiment. The context provided does not offer any indication of these factors and how they might be affecting the stability of the index. Third, stock markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable, and the performance of a particular index can change quickly in response to new information and unforeseen events. It would be difficult to predict with certainty that the Nikkei 225 will remain stable in the future based solely on the context provided. In conclusion, while the context mentions that Asian shares were mostly lower on the day due to trade friction between the U.S. and Canada and that negotiations between the two countries will continue throughout the week, it does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the future stability of the Nikkei 225. Predicting the performance of a stock market index requires comprehensive analysis of various factors and an understanding of the complex interactions between these factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: On March 17 there will be an explosion of green colour across the world in celebration of St Patrick's Day. The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world.

News article: Chrysler Gets Judge's Approval for Asset Sale NEW YORK, June 1 -- The lightning-speed journey of Chrysler through bankruptcy court has come to a conclusion, with a federal judge approving the government-orchestrated sale of the American icon to a new company run by Italian carmaker Fiat. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez's ruling -- delivered in a 47-page opinion late last night -- effectively marked the end of an era for an American industry icon and represented a success for the Obama administration, which played a key role in crafting the company's restructuring strategy. \\"The Sale Motion is granted in its entirety,\\" Gonzalez wrote. The judge's decision came 31 days after Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, among the largest in U.S. history. The speed at which the case has proceeded might set a precedent for General Motors, which followed Chrysler into bankruptcy this morning. The case reached its high point last week when Chrysler urged Gonzalez -- in 34 hours of hearings over three days -- to approve its sale to an entity owned jointly by Fiat, the UAW and the U.S. and Canadian governments. More than 300 objections were filed, including those by lenders and dealers who tried to stop the sale by arguing that the process trampled their rights. Chairman and chief executive Robert Nardelli and other Chrysler executives, however, insisted it was the best and only viable option to avoid liquidation and save jobs. Gonzalez's decision -- the 3,073rd document filed in the case -- sided squarely with Chrysler. \\"Based upon the alternatives available -- and the only other alternative was liquidation -- the sale presented the best opportunity for preserving and maximizing the value of Chrysler's assets and the return to the various stakeholders,\\" he wrote. \\"The sale would strengthen Chrysler for the long-term, benefiting all constituents, including U.S. taxpayers, employees, creditors, dealers, suppliers and secured lenders. In the end, our sole aim was to benefit everyone.\\" A prominent objector to the sale has been a small group of first-lien lenders to Chrysler. Three Indiana pension and construction funds, which hold about 42 million of the 6.9 billion in senior secured loans, contend that their property rights were violated and that the 29 cents on the dollar they would recover under the terms of the government-orchestrated sale is less than what junior lenders would get. The UAW, for example would receive a 55 percent stake in the new Chrysler. The new entity would get most of Chrysler's assets in exchange for 2 billion, which would be distributed among the first-lien lenders. Fiat, which would manage the new Chrysler, is not putting up cash but will be providing technology for small, fuel-efficient vehicles, an area in which Chrysler has lagged its competitors. Gonzalez ruled that the Chrysler was getting \\"fair value for the assets being sold\\" and that \\"not one penny\\" of the value of Chrysler's assets is going to anyone other than the first-lien lenders. The Indiana funds promptly appealed the ruling this morning in U.S. District Court. The U.S. government has provided more than 8 billion in loans to Chrysler, which will largely be forgiven. The government will provide an additional 6 billion to the new Chrysler. The Indiana pension funds also contend that the federal government exerted undue influence over the sale. Gonzalez, however, said that the extent to which the government should be involved in protecting certain industries is \\"a political decision, and the Court does not express a view as to the governmental entities' involvement here.\\" \\"The economic reality is that no one was willing to lend other than the governmental entities,\\" he said. \\"Further, in the current economic climate, the only alternative would be an immediate liquidation, which the evidence has shown would not bring a higher return to creditors.\\" Objections filed by many of the 787 dealers that will be eliminated are to be heard further in a hearing Thursday. But Gonzalez's ruling portends an uphill battle for the dealers. The underlying argument of many opposing the transaction, Gonzalez noted, is not against the federal government's involvement but the desire to have it protect every stakeholder from economic loss -- not just those that the government perceives as being essential to the survival of a successful new Chrysler. \\"For example, any dealership rejection that is approved will cause hardship to the particular dealership involved but may well be necessary if New Chrysler is to survive,\\" he wrote. \\"These are the kinds of economic decisions that have to be made in every bankruptcy case.\\" Like Chrysler, GM is seeking a quick sale of most of its assets to a \\"new GM,\\" in which the U.S. government will have a 60 percent stake. The transaction \\"will enable New GM to become an engine of opportunity and prosperity for countless Americans,\\" GM's chief executive, Frederick A. Henderson, said in a 98-page court document filed this morning. The alternative, he said, was liquidation and a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.

At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.

The earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple, built by Alexander the Great to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss. It is revealed that the medallion Lara also recovered from Chen Lo shows how to unlock the information in the Orb; a certain arrangement of musical sounds. Meanwhile, Lara and Terry begin to fall in love again; but Lara starts to back away from him knowing that she could easily kill him if he betrays her.

Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan's institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan's right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \\"self-defense\\" force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan's militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan's future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan's auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of 25,000. It was Japan that produced the world's first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government's loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan's was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by \\"dirty\\" industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age, the Neolithic followed the terminal Holocene Epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming, which produced the \\"Neolithic Revolution\\". It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the Copper Age or Bronze Age; or, in some geographical regions, in the Iron Age). The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals. The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called \\"proto-Neolithic\\" is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC.

To cancel out that -69, we can add 69 to both sides of the equation: -69*w - 69 + 69 = 0 + 69 Now we have: -69*w = 69 To solve for \\"w\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by -69. It's like splitting the candies equally to find out how many candies each person gets: w = 69 / -69 When we divide those numbers, we get: w = -1 So the solution for the math problem is w = -1. It means when you replace \\"w\\" by \\"-1\\" the equation will be true."},{"prompt":"Given the below context: Dr. Jan Żabiński is director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest in 1930s Europe, assisted by his wife, Antonina. On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw and Invasion of Poland commences. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving. He begins working with the Underground Army to transport Jews to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are hidden in the zoo's cages, tunnels, and inside the Żabińskis' house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. The Żabińskis continue smuggling Jews out of the Ghetto. In 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to death camps.

They are eating food left on the street for cats - it is heart wrenching,\\" she said. She described how one young boy from Afghanistan was being held in jail with his father who had been arrested for having forged documents, but she helped to get them both released. Another nine-year-old boy who was injured in a car bomb attack in Afghanistan was living on the beach with his parents, she said.

The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much humorous derivation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Six by Seven (also written as SIX.BY SEVEN or six.by seven or six.byseven) are a Nottingham-based indie rock band who originally consisted of Chris Olley on vocals and guitars, James Flower on keyboards, Sam Hempton on guitar, Paul Douglas on bass and Chris Davis on drums. Exponents of building, atmospheric drone-rock, influenced heavily by bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 they found a niche in the industry with a considerable underground following, but despite some attempts to commercialise their sound, this never crossed over into mainstream success. After splitting up in 2008, the band reformed in 2012 with Olley and Flower the only original members. - Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was \\"colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia\\" (Stephen Erlewine, \\"AllMusic\\"). Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a drug band due to the members drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their respective subsequent projects; Sonic Boom/Spectrum and Spiritualized. - Club Sandwich at the Peveril Hotel was the final release by Six by Seven , made after the group disbanded . Following the split in late 2005 , 3 original members of the band ( Chris Olley , James Flower and Chris Davis ) formed a new band ( tentatively called ' Collision ' ) with two additional members ( Ady Fletcher and Tony ' Doggen ' Foster ) , with the hope of developing a new sound . Understandably , the sessions ended up sounding like Six by Seven , and so the recordings were released under that moniker . - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892 September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois for eighteen years, from 1949 to 1967. During his Senate career, he was a prominent member of the liberal coalition. - Nottingham is a city and unitary authority area in Nottinghamshire, England, located south of Sheffield and north of Leicester. - Chris Olley is a Nottingham based musician and photographer. He was the lead singer and guitarist for Six By Seven and also the band's main creative influence. He studied art at Wakefield College (199091) and gained a BA (Hons)in Photography at Nottingham Trent University (199194). It was at his time at University that Olley met Sam Hempton and together they formed six.byseven.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 18*s + 40*s = -880 + 68 for s.","completion":"Alright! Here is the step-by-step solution to the equation. The equation you've provided is: 18s + 40s = -880 + 68. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides where possible. On the left side of the equation, you have 18s + 40s. These are like terms because they have the same variable \\"s,\\" and thus can be combined. 18s + 40s equals 58s On the right side of the equation, you have -880 + 68. These are constants and can be combined as well. -880 + 68 equals -812 So after simplification, your equation now is: 58s = -812 Step 2: Solve the equation to find the value of \\"s\\". Because our equation 58s = -812 is multiplication (58 multiplied by some number s equals -812), we will solve this using division. You will isolate s by dividing both sides of the equation by 58: s = -812 / 58 Step 3: The final calculation to get the value of \\"s\\". s = -14 So, the solution to the equation is s = -14."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If your visual impairment is preexisting, and you have recently hired a new employee, you may wonder when the best time is to discuss this disability. The longer you wait, the more you open the door for potential confusion or run the risk of your other employees disclosing your disability for you.","completion":"Therefore, arguably, the best time to share this information is during the orientation period. During this time, new employees are usually in the process of learning about the business, the workplace culture, and their specific roles. Informing them about your visual impairment early on can increase their understanding of your unique situation while avoiding any misconceptions that might surface if they observe any unusual interactions. Moreover, an early disclosure can foster openness and trust between you and your new employee, which are essential factors in building a strong working relationship. Begin by explaining your condition. When talking about your visual disability, start by explaining what it is. State your condition directly - this could be anything from loss of peripheral vision to total blindness. Keep in mind that the employee may not be familiar with your specific kind of visual impairment, so try to describe it in layman's terms. For instance, if you have retinitis pigmentosa, which affects your peripheral vision, you could say, \\"I have a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which means that I don't see things that are on the sides or corners. It's kind of like looking through a tunnel.\\" Keeping your explanation clear and straightforward can promote understanding and empathy. Discuss the nature of your vision impairment with clarity, and specify how and to what extent it affects your daily functioning and work performance. However, also reassure them that despite your disability, you are fully capable of performing your roles and responsibilities. Describe specifics about your daily work life. Offer practical examples of how you manage your daily tasks within the workplace given your condition. This will give your employee a clear picture of what your work routine looks like and how their work will intersect with yours. You can talk about the tools and techniques you use, such as using screen reading software or having documents printed in large font sizes. Discuss potential challenges and your coping strategies. Once your employee has a basic understanding of your visual disability, it might be helpful to discuss possible challenges that can occur in the workplace as a result of your condition. Mention any specific scenarios that might be relevant to your roles and responsibilities and disclose how you manage them effectively. Your transparency will encourage your employees to approach these situations with understanding and flexibility. More importantly, it can teach them how to best support you in these scenarios, fostering a more cooperative and harmonious work environment. Encourage questions and provide opportunities for open dialogue. Remember, your discussion should not be a one-way street. After you share information about your visual disability, create opportunities for the employee to offer their thoughts or ask questions. This will encourage open dialogue and facilitate a deeper understanding of your condition. The process of engaging in such a conversation might seem daunting, but it has many benefits, including promoting inclusivity, fostering empathy, and building understanding. Being proactive and open about your visual impairment can create a bond of trust and respect between you and your employees, ultimately fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment. In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to discussing your visual impairment with your employees. The information above provides a general guideline, but you should tailor your conversation to the specific needs of your business and the individual employee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school.

Please answer the following question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. how long the problem lasted: - not enough information - 150 years - 250 years - 200 years A:","completion":"To determine the duration of the problem (finding a suitable design for the Rialto Bridge), we must identify when the process began and when it was resolved.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Yes, out of date Review: This book was well written for its time but Google no longer uses the formulas found in this book. Any book written before August 2005 should be considered out of date at this point. At that time Google introduced the concept of 'Quality Score' and that changed things quite a bit. Google also recently (December, 2007) changed the way it analyzes the associaton of keywords, ads, CPR, and site content. So the basic concepts of this book are fine but the specifics have moved on. I wish I had read the review from October, 2005 entitled \\"Nice but...it's obsolete\\". Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is mixed, leaning towards negative. Although the reviewer acknowledges that the book was well-written for its time, they emphasize that it is now outdated and not useful anymore due to significant changes in Google's algorithms and practices. The reviewer also expresses disappointment regarding not having read a previous review that pointed out the book's obsolescence.

A Great Western Railway train travelling from Westbury to Weymouth narrowly missed the vehicle. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) identified a miscommunication between the driver and a signaller. In its report, investigators said the train driver saw the tractor starting to cross, sounded the horn and applied the emergency brake. The train came to a stop 450 metres past the crossing. The train driver and the farm worker then both called the signaller to report the near miss. CCTV photos from the train showed the tractor and trailer cleared the line when the train was around 30 metres from the crossing. The train involved was four minutes late leaving Castle Cary railway station and had not passed the crossing when the tractor driver called the signaller asking if the train had been through. The RAIB said the signaller did not to hear this correctly and assumed that the train had passed the crossing. He did not confirm this with the driver and told him he could cross. Investigators said the incident \\"demonstrates the importance of signallers leading the conversation during phone calls from crossing users who may not be accustomed to safety-critical communications\\". It also advised that \\"signallers fully consider and understand the information available to them when deciding whether to give a crossing user permission to cross the line\\".","completion":"On the morning of November 26th, a farm worker was towing a trailer across a level crossing at Thorney Marsh Lane near Castle Cary, Somerset. A Great Western Railway train traveling from Westbury to Weymouth almost collided with the vehicle, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic accident. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that miscommunication between the driver and a signaller played a key role in the incident. Upon noticing the tractor starting to cross the tracks, the train driver promptly sounded the horn, applied the emergency brake, and managed to stop the train 450 meters past the crossing. CCTV footage from the train revealed that the tractor and trailer cleared the line just as the train was approximately 30 meters away from the crossing. The incident was further complicated by the late departure of the train involved – it left Castle Cary railway station four minutes behind schedule. Consequently, the train had not passed the crossing when the tractor driver called the signaller to inquire if it was safe to proceed. Due to the miscommunication, the signaller incorrectly assumed that the train had already crossed and authorized the tractor driver to proceed without verifying the train's actual position. The RAIB's report highlights the significance of effective communication in safety-critical situations, emphasizing that signallers should take the lead during phone calls with crossing users who might not be familiar with safety protocols. Additionally, the report advises signallers to carefully evaluate and comprehend available information before granting permission to cross railway lines, to avoid similar incidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"SETimes: What are the main issues that fathers face if they want to actively participate in their child's life? The main issues that fathers may face when desiring to actively participate in their child's life can be summarized in several key areas: 1. Societal expectations and gender roles: There is still a perception in some societies that the mother should be the primary caregiver and nurturer, while the father's role is to provide financial support. This stereotype can create barriers for fathers who wish to take an active role in their child's upbringing and may face criticism or resistance from their social circle or even the child's mother. 2. Legal challenges: In cases of separation or divorce, fathers may face legal challenges in obtaining custody or sufficient visitation rights, which can prevent them from fully participating in their child's life. Courts may still be biased towards granting primary custody to mothers, especially when the child is young, and this can lead to fathers having limited access to their children. 3. Work-life balance: Fathers in full-time employment may struggle to balance work commitments with their desire to be actively involved in their child's life. Long working hours, lack of flexible work arrangements, and minimal parental leave policies for fathers can contribute to the difficulty in achieving a proper work-life balance. 4. Lack of support networks: Mothers often have access to a wide range of support networks, such as mothers' clubs, playgroups, and other parenting resources. Fathers, on the other hand, may have limited access to similar support networks and can feel isolated or unsure of how best to engage with their children. 5. Feeling of inadequacy or lack of experience: Some fathers may feel insecure about their ability to nurture and care for their children, especially if they lack experience or knowledge in child-rearing. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt about their role as a father, potentially resulting in reduced involvement with their child. 6. Financial pressure: Fathers who want to dedicate more time to their children may experience financial stress as a result of reduced working hours or increased childcare costs. This can further discourage fathers from actively participating in their child's life. 7. Co-parenting challenges: In cases where parents are co-parenting or separated, fathers may experience difficulties in establishing a positive and cooperative relationship with their child's mother, which can limit their ability to be involved in their child's upbringing. Addressing these issues requires joint efforts from both individuals and societies to create more supportive environments for fathers, challenge traditional gender roles, and promote equitable parenting opportunities for both parents. This can give fathers the chance to actively participate in their children's lives and contribute to their well-being and overall development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
