The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said. Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people?

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books.

The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon.

Write a summary based on this article: A filmmaker has gone into hiding after his movie attacking Islam's Prophet Muhammad sparked assaults on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya, where an American State Department officer was killed. Writer and director Sam Bacile spoke on the phone Tuesday from an unidentified location. He remained defiant, saying Islam is \\"a cancer\\" and he wanted his film to make a political statement. The 56-year-old identifies himself as an Israeli Jew and says he believes his video will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. Excerpts dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube. Among other claims that have caused outrage, the film claims Muhammad was a philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse. Bacile says he's sorry for the person who died, but blames lax embassy security. ||||| Read this story in Arabic. Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American. In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene. In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said. A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement late Tuesday. \\"We are heartbroken by this terrible loss,\\" Clinton said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack.\\" Clinton said that she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities \\"in the strongest terms\\" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was \\"working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide.\\" Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack, saying it \\"led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals.\\" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating. It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night. \\"One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?\\" she asked. In Egypt, police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, \\"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,\\" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals. A volley of warning shots were fired, as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots. Are you there? Share your images and videos. Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie. In a series of disjointed scenes, the film depicts Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer. The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him. Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised 5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported. Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive. \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\\" Clinton said. \\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\\" But she stressed that \\"there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\" Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which \\"may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior.\\" \\"It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,\\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. \\"Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon.\\" Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans. An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in. \\"This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,\\" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. \\"But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control.\\" The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. \\"There are police forces at the demonstrations,\\" El Naggary said. \\"They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave.\\" Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel. Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, \\"We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement.\\" \\"We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,\\" he said. \\"I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?\\" He added that \\"the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable.\\" The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday. It also said in a statement that it \\"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\\" \\"Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,\\" the statement said. \\"We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.\\" The embassy statement set off a political spat back in the United States after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the White House. \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,\\" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday. He said he was \\"outraged\\" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt. The Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's comments. \\"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,\\" Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman said in an email. Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011. Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes. \\"These protests are a bad image for Egypt,\\" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. \\"Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems.\\" \\"All I want for Egypt is security and stability,\\" he said. \\"And as you can see this isn't it.\\" The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead. Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker to portray Islam as a violent religion. Geert Wilders' film \\"Fitna,\\" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

Bacile remains defiant, saying Islam is \\"a cancer\\" and he wanted his film to make a political statement. The 56-year-old identifies himself as an Israeli Jew and believes his video will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. The film claims, among other things, that Muhammad was a philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse. Bacile says he's sorry for the person who died, but blames lax embassy security. The United States has said it is taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American. In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag. In Libya, members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate. A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, according to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities \\"in the strongest terms\\" and stated that the U.S. government was \\"working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Obama's Syria Policy Slammed by Diplomats in Internal Memo Dozens of U.S. diplomats have signed an internal memo lambasting President Barack Obama’s strategy in Syria, demanding stronger military action and targeted air strikes on the country’s leader Bashar Assad. The memo has been endorsed by 51 members of the State Department and slams Assad’s repeated violation of a cease-fire agreement amid his country’s five-year civil war, the New York Times reports. It also says American policy has been “overwhelmed” in Syria and advocates “a judicious use of stand-off and air weapons” to bolster U.S. diplomatic efforts. Obama’s military focus in the Middle Eastern nation thus far has been about eradicating the Islamic State (ISIS) extremist group while attempting to win over Assad through dialogue, but the memo argues that Assad’s bombing of his own citizens is the “root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses an internal memo signed by 51 US diplomats criticizing President Barack Obama's strategy in Syria.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: STOCKHOLM - Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Prize winner for literature, said on Friday that diversity in global cultures makes human beings' cultural life interesting. Mo told a reception in the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm that it was a responsibility to protect the diversity in cultures while creating the diversity as well. He said that translation played a very important role in bridging different cultures, adding that without the translators who had translated his books he couldn't have won the Nobel Prize. \\"I think translation is much harder than writing itself,\\" said Mo Yan, explaining that it only took 43 days to write the work Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out, while it took Swedish sinologist Anna Gustafsson Chen six years to translate the work. Earlier in the day he visited a Swedish middle school, where about 20 Swedish students who were studying Chinese welcomed him by singing the theme song in the movie \\"Red Sorghum\\" which was based on his novel of the same name. \\"Unlike the rough and husky voice in the movie, the Swedish students presented the song with a gentle and soft voice, making it rather a romantic song,\\" Mo told the gathering at the Chinese Embassy. He said he hoped that there were going to be some outstanding translators among the students, adding that meeting them made him \\"extraordinarily happy.\\" He said language was going to be \\"the most reliable way\\" for interaction between peoples because one had to know the language of a nation to understand the people's inner world and spiritual life. Lan Lijun, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, said that Chinese literature had stepped into the spotlight worldwide after Mo Yan had won the Nobel Prize, which would help contribute to the literature communication and dialogue between China and the rest of the world. People in Sweden and other parts of the world were all welcome to know more about Chinese culture, he added.

Question: What does the alien use to activate the transportation device? Title: Being from Another Planet Movie plot: While California University of the Sciences professor Douglas McCadden (Ben Murphy) explores the tomb of the ancient Egyptian king Tutankhamun, an earthquake causes a wall in the tomb to collapse, revealing a hidden chamber. Inside, McCadden finds a mummy in a sarcophagus. Unbeknownst to McCadden, the \\"mummy\\" is not the body of a dead Egyptian, but an extraterrestrial alien in suspended animation, being wrapped up and buried alive thousands of years before and covered with a dormant, green fungus. The body is brought back to California and McCadden has it examined by Dr. Ken Melrose (Austin Stoker) and X-rayed by student Peter Sharpe (Kevin Brophy) before a big press conference about the discovery. While reviewing the X-rays, Sharpe notices there are five crystals around the \\"mummy's\\" head. Sharpe steals the crystals and makes new X-rays to cover up his theft. He sells four of the crystals to students who are unaware of their origin. The second set of X-rays overdose the body with radiation. This causes the fungus to re-activate and the alien to awaken from suspended animation. At the press conference the next day, one of the students touches the fungus on the sarcophagus, which eats away one of his fingers. The sarcophagus is then opened in front of the press to reveal that the mummy is gone. Melrose and his colleague Dr. Hayworth (Antoinette Bower) attempt to identify the fungus and destroy it. At first, everyone assumes that the mummy's disappearance is because of a fraternity prank.

Rose was born April 14, 1941, in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four children born to Harry Francis \\"Pete\\" and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the Order of DeMolay as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports. He played baseball and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team. During a spring training game against the Chicago White Sox in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, Don Blasingame, pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and made the most of it. During another spring training game against the New York Yankees, Whitey Ford gave him the derisive nickname \\"Charlie Hustle\\" after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a walk. Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In Ken Burns' documentary Baseball, Mickey Mantle claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything. Rose made his major league debut on April 8, 1963 (Opening Day) against the Pittsburgh Pirates and drew a walk in his first plate appearance. After going 0-for-11, Rose got his first Major League hit on April 13, a triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. He hit .273 for the year and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, collecting 17 of 20 votes. Rose entered the US Army Reserves after the 1963 baseball season. He was assigned to Fort Knox for six months of active duty, which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. At Fort Knox, he was a platoon guide and graduated from United States Army Basic Training January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his Fort Thomas service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he could get out early enough to participate in local Reds games.

Given the background: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. and the situation: Two neighboring cities are situated in a volcanic area with lots of earthquakes. Park city is situated near a very active volcano, while Hill city is situated 50 miles north. Answer the following question: Which city experiences more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up?","completion":"Based on the information given, Park City would experience more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up as it is situated near a very active volcano. The proximity to the volcano suggests that the city would be more affected by the push upward of magma into the volcano's magma chamber - the process that contributes to stresses accumulating in the adjacent rock. Consequently, this build-up of stress is likely to induce more earthquakes in Park City as compared to Hill City, which is situated 50 miles north. It's important to note that the occurrence of earthquakes and their strength can vary greatly in different locations based on a variety of factors including distance from the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake, the geology of the area, amongst other factors. However, under the assumption that all other factors are equal, the closer proximity of Park City to the active volcano would make it more susceptible to the build-up of stresses on neighboring rock and therefore more earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. To understand this, let's break down and analyze the premise and hypothesis separately, and then identify their relationship. Premise: \\"It makes you very predictable.\\" This statement suggests that there is a specific factor or situation (let's call it X) that leads to a person becoming highly predictable in their actions, behaviors, or decisions. In other words, due to the presence of X, one can anticipate what the person will do in certain circumstances. Hypothesis: \\"It doesn't make you unpredictable.\\" This statement works as a negation or contradiction of the original premise. The hypothesis implies that the same factor or situation (X) does not lead to a person becoming unpredictable or difficult to anticipate in their actions, behaviors, or decisions. In essence, the hypothesis is arguing that it's not the case that X contributes to unpredictability. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true (that the presence of X makes a person very predictable), it inherently leads to the fact that X does not make the person unpredictable. The concept of predictability and unpredictability are opposites; therefore, if you are one, you cannot be the other. So, when the premise is considered true, it is a logical conclusion to say that the hypothesis is also true. If X makes you very predictable, then it cannot make you unpredictable. The connection between these two statements creates a cause and effect relationship. Since being predictable is the opposite of being unpredictable, it is impossible for X to cause both at the same time. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then it logically implies that the hypothesis is true as well. The presence of X, which makes a person very predictable, inherently disallows the same person from being unpredictable. The statements are mutually exclusive, and if one is true, the other must be true too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But the Muslim cleric who is running for parliament in Afghanistan is calling for the murder of American children in response to scorched Korans, which is worse. Where is the media's focus? Book burning is antithetical to American ideals. People have a constitutional right to burn a Koran if they want to, but doing so is insensitive and an unnecessary provocation – much like building a mosque at Ground Zero. I would hope that Pastor Terry Jones and his supporters will consider the ramifications of their planned book-burning event. It will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don’t feed that fire. If your ultimate point is to prove that the Christian teachings of mercy, justice, freedom, and equality provide the foundation on which our country stands, then your tactic to prove this point is totally counter-productive. Our nation was founded in part by those fleeing religious persecution. Freedom of religion is integral to our charters of liberty. We don’t need to agree with each other on theological matters, but tolerating each other without unnecessarily provoking strife is how we ensure a civil society. In this as in all things, we should remember the Golden Rule. Isn’t that what the Ground Zero mosque debate has been about? - Sarah Palin ||||| It turns out that tolerant, moderate Malaysian Muslims didn’t see things quite that way. They took the Christians’ ecumenical gesture as an affront — an effort to proselytize for Christianity or, as Imam Rauf himself put it, “to manipulate the word [“Allah”] to win converts.” So the tolerant, moderate Muslims did their usual Terry-Jackass-Jones-on-steroids routine: They didn’t just burn Bibles, they fire-bombed churches. Non-Islamic proselytism is prohibited by sharia, as Imam Rauf, who wants the United States to be more sharia-compliant, could tell you. And what did Rauf do? Did he condemn this blatant Christianophobia? Did he lecture Malaysians that thewas perfectly within its legal rights to invoke “Allah” in the service of Christianity, and that living in a tolerant, pluralistic society that ensures free expression means accepting the’s actions even if they make Muslims uncomfortable? Are you kidding? Instead, Imam Rauf took to the newspapers to admonish Christians on the need to show more sensitivity to Muslims’ feelings. “My message to the Christian community in Malaysia,” he proclaimed, “is that using the word Allah to mean the Christian God may be theologically and legally correct, but in the context of Malaysia, it is socially provocative. If you want to have influence with people in Malaysia, you must find a way to convey your message without provoking this kind of response.” You know what else might be “socially provocative”? A giant mosque at Ground Zero. – Andrew C. McCarthy, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, is the author, most recently, of The Grand Jihad: How Islam and the Left Sabotage America. ||||| There is nothing you can do about the crazy 5 percent except ask the police to keep an eye on them during large public events, where they sometimes appear carrying machine guns just to make a political point about the Second Amendment. And, in situations like a Koran-burning, make it clear that the rest of us disagree. Photo So far, the people lining up to denounce the burning of the Koran include the pope, Gen. David Petraeus and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . On the Republican side, Haley Barbour , theMississippi governor and would-be presidential contender, stepped up to the plate. “I don’t think there is any excuse for it,” said Barbour at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor . Unfortunately, Barbour followed up his bow to tolerance by suggesting that the public’s confusion over Barack Obama ’s religion is because of the fact that “this is a president that we know less about than any other president in history.” The governor claimed that Americans had been particularly deprived of information on Obama’s youth, while they knew a great deal about the formative years of the other chief executives all the way back to the way the youthful George Washington “chopped down a cherry tree.” Let us reconsider the above paragraph in light of the fact that while Obama wrote an entire book about his childhood, Washington never chopped down the cherry tree.

View all New York Times newsletters. But I digress. While a pope, a general and a cabinet member are speaking out, the candidates running in this year’s elections seem to be superquiet about the Koran-burning. However, quite a few have been racing to bash the Muslim community center for Lower Manhattan . In Florida, the gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott has an ad railing against a mosque “just yards away” from ground zero, which is semiaccurate only if you believe “city blocks” and “yards” are the same thing. And in New York, the Republican candidates for governor appear to be running for the Mosque Removal slot on the ballot. “Just before the primary, we had candidates who thought they might gain more votes by bashing Islam,” said Saleh Sbenaty, a leader of the Muslim families in Murfreesboro, Tenn., whose community center construction site has been vandalized twice in recent weeks. “We had a rough, rough time during the primary.” My memories of Sept. 11, 2001, are still intense, and they are mainly about the outpouring of concern from the rest of the country. The piles of donated clothes and food piled up, unused but not necessarily unwanted since each bit was a token of someone’s good will toward the city. Helping us achieve that state of public grace is the highest possible duty of every elected official. But, lately, they’ve abdicated or worse. And the fight for public sanity has fallen to average citizens, like Professor Sbenaty, who is still trying to explain to the rest of the world what happened in his community. “Let me say first,” he told an interviewer on NPR, “there are crazy people in every society.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The news article discusses the controversy surrounding book burning, particularly the burning of the Koran, and the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero. It highlights the insensitive and provocative nature of these acts, calling for consideration of the ramifications of planned book-burning events and reminding that America is built upon ideals of religious freedom and tolerance. The article also mentions instances of backlash against Christian churches in Malaysia by moderate Muslims who perceived the use of the word \\"Allah\\" as an insult, as well as Imam Rauf's response, which called for Christians to show more sensitivity to Muslims' feelings. The article also touches upon the response of public figures such as the pope, Gen. David Petraeus, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Koran-burning events, while noting that political candidates have been more vocal about opposing the construction of a Muslim community center in New York City. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of religious tolerance and acknowledging that there are extremists everywhere, but this should not compromise the core values of society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Russian","completion":"Теперь вы можете получить повышение зарплаты на 300 долларов, и вам даже не нужно просить об этом вашего начальника. Это выглядит привлекательным, так? Получение повышения на работе обычно означает улучшение финансового положения, признание ваших усилий и профессионального роста. Однако это может быть вызовом, особенно если вам нужно просить о нем у вашего непосредственного руководителя. Важно быть готовым предложить рациональные аргументы и продемонстрировать свою ценность для компании. Вот несколько советов и идей, как это сделать: 1. Покажите свои достижения и результаты работы: Составьте список своих достижений и результата работы, демонстрирующих, как вы способствовали росту и успеху компании. Опишите новые навыки, которыми вы овладели и как они были полезны для компании. 2. Сравните свою заработную плату с рынком: Исследуйте стандарты оплаты труда для людей с аналогичными навыками и опытом, как в вашем регионе, так и в вашей отрасли. Это поможет вам понять, предлагает ли ваш работодатель конкурентоспособную зарплату. 3. Получите обратную связь от коллег и партнеров: Нейтральные и объективные комментарии о вашей работе от других людей могут также укрепить вашу позицию и показать вам глаза начальника с лучшей стороны. 4. Имейте конкретную сумму в виду: Зная, сколько вы хотите получить и как она позиционируется на рынке, вы сможете предложить конкретное и обоснованное требование к увеличению зарплаты. 5. Готовьтесь к переговорам: Начальник может предложить компромисс – меньше денег или дополнительные льготы, такие как больше отпуска или гибкое рабочее время. Главное – знать, насколько вы готовы идти на уступки и как далеко можете зайти. 6. Выбирайте правильный момент: Подумайте о том, когда лучше всего будет обратиться к начальнику с просьбой о повышении. Хорошим моментом может быть после успешного завершения проекта или после получения крупного клиента. 7. Будьте конструктивными и уверенными: Во время разговора старайтесь оставаться спокойными, уверенными и конструктивными, используя свои аргументы и сконцентрировавшись на фактах, а не на эмоциях. 8. Не бойтесь просить помощи: Если представление о прошении о повышении кажется вам слишком стрессовым, обратитесь к коллегам, друзьям или профессиональным консультантам, которые могут вам помочь. Запомните, что не всегда можно получить повышение без участия вашего руководства, но правильно подготовившись и действуя стратегически, вы сможете значительно увеличить свои шансы на успех."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, the tweet highlights physical discomfort as the user mentions their left hip hurting, and uses the phrase \\"hurting a lot,\\" which implies a significant level of pain. Pain and discomfort are predominantly associated with negative emotions and experiences, further supporting the categorization of the sentiment as negative. Secondly, the tweet outlines an issue that occurred during sleep, mentioning that the pillows came out from between the person's legs. This statement insinuates that the individual is concerned about the potential consequences of this event, especially as they are already experiencing pain in their hip. The uncertainty and worry expressed in this part of the tweet contribute to the overall negative sentiment. Lastly, the tweet concludes with the words \\"I hope nothing bad happened,\\" which implies concern and is indicative of a negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"bad\\" strengthens this association, as it directly refers to an unfavorable outcome.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

Step 2: Compare the key elements with the new sentence - In the sentence \\"The siblings are petting their pet pig\\", the key elements are siblings, petting, and pet pig. Step 3: Analyze the similarities and differences between the two groups of key elements: - The action of 'petting' is present in both sentences. - The original sentence mentions 'young children' while the new sentence refers to 'siblings'. Siblings can be considered a group of young children, but the specific relationship of the original group of young children as siblings is not explicitly stated. - The original sentence mentions a 'piglet' while the new sentence mentions a 'pet pig'. A piglet can grow up and become a pet pig. However, a pet pig might not necessarily be a piglet, and the fact that it's a pet is not mentioned in the original sentence. Step 4: Conclusion - Based on the analysis, the sentence \\"The siblings are petting their pet pig.\\" can be related to the original sentence, but it includes additional information about the relationship between the children and the pig, as well as the pig's status as a pet. Therefore, the new sentence is not a true sentence based solely on the original sentence.

Given the question: Given the following context: Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Disappointed but undeterred, she began searching for alternative options that would provide the same aesthetic appeal without breaking the bank. As a creative and resourceful individual, Janie considered a variety of solutions. First, she thought about learning how to create her own prints using affordable tools and materials. She researched online tutorials and various techniques, such as block printing, screen printing, and digital art software. While it would take some time to develop her skills, Janie realized that creating her own prints would not only save money but also provide a sense of personal accomplishment and an opportunity to express her artistic flair. Next, Janie explored local thrift stores and flea markets in the hopes of finding a similar print at a reduced price. She spent her free time visiting these locations, perusing the wide assortment of pre-owned artwork, and chatting with vendors to negotiate better deals. Through her diligent efforts, Janie eventually found a beautifully framed print that matched her desired aesthetic and was within her budget. Another option that Janie contemplated was reaching out to local artists for a commissioned artwork based on the original print she had admired. This way, she could support local talent, have a unique piece of art tailored to her preferences, and potentially pay a more reasonable price than what the store had demanded for the print. After contacting a few artists and discussing her ideas, Janie received several quotes that were much more affordable than the original print she had seen at the store. Lastly, Janie considered searching for sales and discounts offered by various online retailers that carried the print she initially wanted. She signed up for newsletters and set up sale alerts, allowing her to stay informed about any upcoming promotions. After a few weeks of monitoring different websites, she was excited to find a substantial discount on the print, making it more reasonably priced. In the end, Janie's determination to find a more cost-effective solution paid off. She managed to acquire the desired print during an online sale, and through her research and exploration, she gained valuable knowledge and experience in the world of art and design. Additionally, her pursuit of alternative options introduced her to local artists and inspired her to explore her own creative potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This rapid evolution has introduced new media models to cater to diverse preferences and needs. One model, however, has gained increasing attention for its potential to set itself apart from the competition—let's call this \\"Yet Another New Media Model\\" or YANMM. In this article, we'll explore the core elements that define YANMM, examine its key advantages and challenges, and discuss its potential implications on the future of media. Defining Yet Another New Media Model (YANMM) YANMM reflects a groundbreaking approach to content creation, distribution, and monetization. It seeks to address the shortcomings of existing models while capitalizing on their strengths. The model can be characterized by the following primary features: 1. Hybridization: YANMM integrates various forms of content dissemination, such as subscription-based services, ad-supported content, pay-per-view pieces, and sponsored collaborations. By blending these revenue streams, this model ensures enhanced financial stability and offers a catered experience to users with different willingness to pay for content. 2. Personalization and Customization: YANMM leverages sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to offer highly tailored content recommendations that cater to users' specific interests, preferences, and behaviors. This personalization propels user engagement and increases satisfaction. 3. Mobile-first Focus: Recognizing the rising dominance of mobile devices in content consumption, YANMM prioritizes mobile optimization in its design and distribution strategies. This creates an intuitive and seamless experience for its target audience. 4. Creator Empowerment: YANMM places strong emphasis on supporting content creators by enabling them to retain control over their intellectual property, set their pricing structures, and maintain direct relationships with their audiences. 5. Emphasis on User Experience (UX): YANMM ensures an interactive and engaging experience by incorporating multimedia content, gamified elements, and a user-friendly interface. A positive UX is paramount in attracting and retaining the audience's attention in the digital era. Key Advantages YANMM's hybrid and adaptable nature promises several benefits over traditional media models. These advantages include: 1. Diversification of Revenue Streams: By amalgamating multiple monetization techniques, YANMM increases financial security and decreases the risks associated with relying on a single revenue source. 2. Inclusivity: By offering different pricing tiers and consumption options, YANMM caters to various consumer profiles, promoting inclusivity and broadening its market reach. 3.

Creator Incentivization: By giving content creators flexibility in monetization, ownership, and connection to their audience, YANMM encourages the production of high-quality content. Challenges While the YANMM model offers enticing prospects, it is not without its challenges: 1. Scalability: The overlapping nature of content types and monetization could complicate YANMM's scalability as it grows and expands its user base. 2. Privacy and Data Protection: Personalization requires extensive data collection and analysis, which raises concerns about user privacy and data protection. 3. Regulation: As YANMM operates within the intersections of various content types, it may face regulatory challenges and require compliance with different industry laws. Implications for the Future of Media If YANMM successfully navigates these challenges and grows in prominence, it has the potential to profoundly impact the media landscape. By offering a versatile and user-centric experience, YANMM may emerge as a strong contender among traditional media models. By empowering creators and fostering inclusivity, while marrying innovative ideas with tried-and-tested monetization strategies, YANMM might indeed pave the way for a new era of content consumption and creation. Conclusion As technology and audience preferences continue to evolve, so must the media models that deliver content. Yet Another New Media Model represents an innovative approach that addresses the diverse and ever-changing needs of the contemporary media landscape. While challenges lie ahead, YANMM's potential to reshape the way we create, distribute, and consume media warrants close attention and ongoing evaluation."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Skylar was a baker and had to mix all the ingredients for the recipe.

News article: The coral die-off crisis is a climate crime and Exxon fired the gun Coral reefs are probably Earth’s most life-packed ecosystem; those who’ve had the privilege of diving in the tropics know the reef as an orderly riot of colour and flow, size and shape. Which is why a white, dead reef is so shocking – as shocking in its way as a human corpse lying on the street, which still takes the form of the living breathing person it used to be, but now suddenly is stopped forever, the force that made it real suddenly and grotesquely absent. When a body falls on the street, the police come to investigate. Did this person die of natural causes, or was there foul play involved? When a reef dies, we ask the scientists. And this year they’ve told us the answer in no uncertain terms. The amazingly rapid die-off of a huge percentage of the world’s coral reefs is not a sad but normal tragedy; it’s a crime. Perhaps the fastest, most widespread crime of the global warming era. Related: The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare Vast swaths of coral were bleached this spring, much of the damage done in a matter of weeks as a wave of warm water swept across the Pacific and west into the Indian Ocean. The immediate culprit was clear: the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures that comes from climate change. But that’s like saying “he was killed by a bullet”. The important question is: who fired the gun? We know the biggest culprits now, because great detective work by investigative journalists has uncovered key facts in the past year. The world’s biggest oil company, Exxon, knew everything there was to know about climate change by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its scientists understood how much and how fast it was going to warm, and how much damage that was going to do. And the company knew the scientists were right: that’s why they started “climate-proofing” their own installations, for instance building their drilling rigs to accommodate the sea level rise they knew was coming. What they didn’t do was tell the rest of us. Instead, they – and many other players in the fossil fuel industry – bankrolled the rise of the climate denial industry, helping fund the “thinktanks” and front groups that spent the last generation propagating the phoney idea that there was a deep debate about the reality of global warming. As a result, we’ve wasted a quarter century in a phoney argument about whether the climate was changing. Had Exxon and its ilk merely told the truth, that argument would have been over: no one would have accused them of being “climate alarmists”. We would have gone to work to solve the problem. Our work wouldn’t be over by now, but it would be well advanced; the atmospheric level of CO2 wouldn’t have topped 400 parts per million, and the temperature rise wouldn’t be flirting with 1.5C. There would be coral bleaching, but there likely wouldn’t be a coral massacre on the scale we’ve seen this year. Which means that the victims should be angry as well as sad. The people who depend on the reefs for food, and for shelter from the waves; the economies that count on tourist dollars; the people who take spiritual sustenance from the ongoing drama beneath the waves. The reefs can’t be made whole again: if they recover at all it will be slowly, and in the face of ongoing warming that seems unlikely. But at the very least, the nations that sustained this damage should be compensated. Exxon and its brethren made record profits in the last decades of denial and deceit; that money should rightfully go to pay for the damage it caused, and to build the energy systems that can power our lives without destruction. We need to remember that there’s nothing natural about this horror. It was caused, as so many crimes are, by greed. And that greed is ongoing – Exxon continues to search for more hydrocarbons, and to reject even modest changes to its policies. That’s why we’re wrapping crime scene tape this week around those bleached coral heads, those dead staghorns. That’s why we’re taking crime scene photos with underwater cameras. That’s why we’re protesting on the reefs. We’re not going to let them get away with murder. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. The rapid die-off of a large percentage of the world's coral reefs is attributed to climate change, specifically the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures. This crisis is being referred to as a crime. 2. Investigative journalists have discovered that Exxon, the world's largest oil company, knew about climate change and its impacts from the late 1970s and early 1980s but failed to disclose this information. 3. Instead, Exxon and other fossil fuel companies funded the rise of climate denial, contributing to a 25-year delay in acting on climate change. 4. The delayed action has led to severe consequences, including the extensive damage to coral reefs and their ecosystem. 5. The author calls for compensation from Exxon and similar companies to nations affected by the damage, as well as for a shift towards clean energy systems. 6. Protests and demonstrations are being staged to hold these companies accountable for the damage they caused to the environment due to their actions and greed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The claim: The EU referendum is a big risk to UK and global markets. Reality Check verdict: There is considerable uncertainty about any predictions about what would happen to the economy, but the Bank of England's warning that leaving would be bad for it are in line with mainstream economic thinking. In the minutes from its latest meeting, the MPC warned the pound \\"would fall further, perhaps sharply\\" if there was a Brexit. Currencies generally get stronger or weaker based on what the markets think about how strong economies are. A weaker pound would make imported goods more expensive in the UK, which would cause inflation, and it would make holidays in Europe more expensive. But it would make products and services provided in the UK cheaper to customers overseas, which would be good news for exporters. The MPC said leaving the EU would worsen the terms of trade, reduce productivity and increase the level of risk associated with the economy. It also warned of the danger posed to the global economy, saying that the referendum campaign had dampened sentiment in traders around the world. \\"The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets,\\" it said. The warnings followed a robust response from Bank of England governor Mark Carney to a letter from Vote Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin MP, who had reminded him of rules preventing publicly funded bodies making statements in the month leading up to the referendum that might influence it. Mr Carney stressed that the warnings were part of the normal job of the MPC to provide an assessment of the state of the economy and risks facing it.

When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Renuka 'Renu' (Karthika Nair) who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the memory card of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Saraswathi 'Saro' (Piaa Bajpai) also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate. Settled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan (Kota Srinivasa Rao), describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka to fall in love with Ashwin, which the latter reciprocates. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1955-1956, Heyerdahl organized the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Rapa Nui (Easter Island). The expedition's scientific staff included Arne Skjolsvold, Carlyle Smith, Edwin Ferdon, Gonzalo Figueroa and William Mulloy. Heyerdahl and the professional archaeologists who travelled with him spent several months on Rapa Nui investigating several important archaeological sites. Highlights of the project include experiments in the carving, transport and erection of the notable moai, as well as excavations at such prominent sites as Orongo and Poike. The expedition published two large volumes of scientific reports (Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific) and Heyerdahl later added a third (The Art of Easter Island). Heyerdahl's popular book on the subject, Aku-Aku was another international best-seller. In Easter Island: The Mystery Solved (Random House, 1989), Heyerdahl offered a more detailed theory of the island's history. Based on native testimony and archaeological research, he claimed the island was originally colonized by Hanau eepe (\\"Long Ears\\"), from South America, and that Polynesian Hanau momoko (\\"Short Ears\\") arrived only in the mid-16th century; they may have come independently or perhaps were imported as workers. According to Heyerdahl, something happened between Admiral Roggeveen's discovery of the island in 1722 and James Cook's visit in 1774; while Roggeveen encountered white, Indian, and Polynesian people living in relative harmony and prosperity, Cook encountered a much smaller population consisting mainly of Polynesians and living in privation. Heyerdahl notes the oral tradition of an uprising of \\"Short Ears\\" against the ruling \\"Long Ears\\". The \\"Long Ears\\" dug a defensive moat on the eastern end of the island and filled it with kindling. During the uprising, Heyerdahl claimed, the \\"Long Ears\\" ignited their moat and retreated behind it, but the \\"Short Ears\\" found a way around it, came up from behind, and pushed all but two of the \\"Long Ears\\" into the fire. This moat was found by the Norwegian expedition and it was partly cut down into the rock. Layers of fire were revealed but no fragments of bodies. As for the origin of the people of Easter Island, DNA tests have shown a connection to South America, critics conjecture that this was a result of recent events, but whether this is inherited from a person coming in later times is hard to know. If the story that (almost) all Long Ears were killed in a civil war is true, as the islanders story goes, it would be expected that the statue-building South American bloodline would have been nearly utterly destroyed, leaving for the most part the invading Polynesian bloodline. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many people went along?","completion":"The text does not provide a specific quote that directly answers the question \\"How many people went along?\\" There are mentions of multiple individuals who accompanied Thor Heyerdahl in his expeditions, such as Arne Skjolsvold, Carlyle Smith, Edwin Ferdon, Gonzalo Figueroa and William Mulloy for the Easter Island expedition, but it does not provide a distinct number.

In practice that means around 120 with the 40 heaviest loss-making stores excluded. Sources at BHS treated the announcement with bewilderment. Other very senior retail sources used more colourful language. His credibility has taken a very serious knock. The details that have emerged about Dominic Chappell and his fellow directors' extraction of millions in professional fees has attracted widespread criticism. Just last Tuesday, just days before BHS collapsed, he transferred £1.5m from the struggling company to a Swedish firm owned by a friend and fellow board member. The BHS CEO ordered its repayment which when it came was £50,000 short. The good news for BHS and its 11,000 employees is that his is one of the more unlikely bids in a competitive field of over 50 expressions of interest for some or all of the business. There is no doubt that without a £571m pension bill round its neck, BHS is a far more attractive proposition. Whether that in itself is enough to restore the fortunes of a brand that garners more nostalgic affection than current trade is yet to be seen.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 18*z = 193*z + 1575 for z.. What is the answer??","completion":"Alright! Let's break this down step by step. We have an equation: 18 * z = 193 * z + 1575. The goal is to find what number z should be to make this equation true. First, we'll subtract 193*z from both sides of the equation. This will help us get all the z terms on one side of the equation: (18 * z) - (193 * z) = (193 * z) - (193 * z) + 1575. Now we have: -175 * z = 1575. See how we grouped all the z terms together? That's going to help us find the answer. Next, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by -175 to find the value of z: (-175 * z) / -175 = 1575 / -175.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The San Diego Museum of Art is a fine arts museum located at 1450 El Prado in Balboa Park in San Diego, California that houses a broad collection with particular strength in Spanish art. The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \\"the region's oldest and largest art museum\\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year. - The Young Shepherdess is an 1885 painting by William - Adolphe Bouguereau ( 1825 -- 1905 ) . It is owned by the San Diego Museum of Art. This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content . In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions , in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl . In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the pastoral mode or theme , as developed by ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets . French painters who preceded him in this include Claude Lorrain , Poussin , and Watteau . - William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825 August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter and traditionalist. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown. - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States. It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico. What is the relationship between 'the young shepherdess' and 'france'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" and France stems from the fact that the painting was created by a French artist, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who was active during the 19th century. Born on November 30, 1825, Bouguereau was a renowned academic painter and traditionalist in France and played an influential role in shaping French art during his time. In his paintings, he often depicted realistic genre scenes, with a particular emphasis on mythological themes and the female human body. \\"The Young Shepherdess,\\" painted in 1885, is an excellent example of Bouguereau's skill in capturing the beauty and innocence of his subjects. The painting portrays a young shepherdess with a gentle expression of curiosity, which exemplifies Bouguereau's ability to represent a variety of poses and emotions in his work. This image and other similar works by Bouguereau attracted collectors in Europe and America due to their nostalgic content. In creating \\"The Young Shepherdess,\\" Bouguereau drew inspiration from the pastoral mode or theme, which can be traced back to ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets. He also followed in the footsteps of earlier French painters such as Claude Lorrain, Poussin, and Watteau, who had explored this theme in their own work. As a result, \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" not only highlights the artistic prowess of William-Adolphe Bouguereau but also reflects an important aspect of French art history and tradition. In summary, the relationship between \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" and France lies in its creation by a notable French artist, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who drew upon the country's rich artistic heritage and pastoral themes. The painting stands as a testament to the artist's remarkable talent and serves as a remarkable example of French art from the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(c). no; In order to analyze both sentences and determine whether they can both be true or not, we should first break down each sentence and extract their core meanings. Sentence 1: \\"um mostly what i do i do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing and then i i read a lot\\" This sentence is not very well structured and appears to be casual conversational language, which may affect clarity. However, the main ideas expressed in this sentence are that the person engages in crafts (as mentioned somewhere else) and also reads a lot. To rephrase the sentence for better understanding: \\"Mostly, I do some crafts, like it was mentioned before, and I also read a lot.\\" Sentence 2: \\"I don't do any crafts.\\" This sentence is straightforward and states that the person does not engage in any crafts. Now that we've clarified both sentences, let's analyze their compatibility: - Sentence 1 states that the person does engage in crafts. - Sentence 2 contradicts Sentence 1, as it states the person does not engage in crafts. Given the information provided, if Sentence 1 is considered true (the person does crafts and reads a lot), the second sentence cannot also be true.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon a small town in Illinois which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and began to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators.

Summarize: Harley Barnes opened a gate or climbed it to reach the pond on land at the stables owned by his grandparents in Wiltshire. His mother Hannah Vaughan told the inquest Harley had loved throwing stones in the water. A verdict of accidental death was recorded at the hearing in Salisbury. He had been feeding a horse in a field at the stables in Gastard, near Corsham, when he disappeared on the morning of 28 July. Ms Vaughan said she had given him some feed to take to the horse in the field and \\"that was the last time I saw him alive\\". She said she never saw Harley open the gate to the pond but started calling and looking around for him before finding him in the pond. Neighbour Jennifer Gibson, a midwife, heard her cries for help and rushed to her aid. She told Ms Vaughan to go to her house and ring for an ambulance while she began resuscitation. Harley was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where he was later pronounced dead by doctors. A post-mortem examination found Harley died from freshwater drowning.

Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Question: \\"What connects the adenine-thymine pairs?\\" Context: \\"Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1\\" Answer:","completion":"The adenine-thymine pairs in a DNA double helix are connected by hydrogen bonds. In the context provided, the DNA double helix consists of two chains that twist around each other with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside and the bases pointing inwards. Adenine base pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. The specificity of these base pairings occurs due to the interactions between the atoms in the purine and pyrimidine nucleobases. In the case of the adenine-thymine (A-T) pairs, two hydrogen bonds are responsible for holding the two nucleotide bases together. In their molecular structure, adenine has an amino group and a ring nitrogen atom capable of forming hydrogen bonds, while thymine has two carbonyl oxygen atoms that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors. The arrangement of these atoms in the two bases allows for the formation of two hydrogen bonds between them, contributing to the stability of the DNA double helix. The hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds, but they provide enough strength to hold the two strands of DNA together. These hydrogen bonds can be broken and reformed during processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and repair, which require the separation of the two strands. On the other hand, cytosine-guanine (C-G) pairs form three hydrogen bonds, which makes their pairing stronger than that of adenine-thymine pairs. The presence of both A-T and C-G pairs in a DNA molecule contributes to the overall stability of the double helix and maintains the proper spacing between its two strands. The two strands in a DNA double helix must be complementary to each other, meaning the sequence of bases on one strand matches the opposing strand in a way that adenines pair with thymines and guanines pair with cytosines. This complementary base pairing is a fundamental feature of DNA's structure and function, as it allows accurate replication and transmission of genetic information during cell division and gene expression. In conclusion, the adenine-thymine pairs in a DNA double helix are connected by two hydrogen bonds. These bonds contribute to the specificity of base pairing, stabilize the double helix structure, and maintain the complementary nature of the two DNA strands. The hydrogen bonding between adenine and thymine, along with the bonding between cytosine and guanine, is a critical component of the DNA molecule's structure and its ability to store, replicate, and transmit genetic information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

William John Evans ( , August 16, 1929 - September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked in a trio setting. Evans' use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, \\"singing\\" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, in 1929, he was classically trained, and studied at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music, where he majored in composition and received the Artist Diploma. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In July 1955, Evans returned to New York City and enrolled in the Mannes College of Music for a three-semester postgraduate course in musical composition. He also wrote classical settings of poems by William Blake. Along with his studies, Evans played in mostly low-profile \\"Tuxedo gigs\\" at the Friendship Club and the Roseland Ballroom, as well as Jewish weddings, intermission spots, and over-40 dances. However, better opportunities also arose, such as playing solo opposite the Modern Jazz Quartet at the Village Vanguard, where one day he saw Miles Davis listening to him. During this period, Evans also met Thelonious Monk. Evans soon began to perform in Greenwich Village clubs with Don Elliott, Tony Scott, and Mundell Lowe; as well as with bandleader Jerry Wald. While Evans may have played on some of Wald's discs, his first proven Wald recording was Listen to the Music of Jerry Wald, which also featured his future drummer Paul Motian. In early 1955, singer Lucy Reed moved to New York City to play at the Village Vanguard and The Blue Angel, and in August she recorded The Singing Reed with a group which included Evans. During this period, he met two of Reed's friends: manager Helen Keane, who, seven years later, would become his own agent; and George Russell, with whom he would soon work. That year, he also made his first recording, in a small ensemble, in Dick Garcia's A Message from Garcia. In parallel, Evans kept with his work with Scott, playing in Preview's Modern Jazz Club in Chicago during December-January 1956/7, and recording The Complete Tony Scott. After the Complete sessions, Scott left for a long overseas tour.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Title: Raging Bull Movie plot: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

With perseverance, grit, and a burning passion for the sport, Matt would undoubtedly continue to dominate the slopes and etch his name amongst the greats in the world of skiing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this: What is the outermost structure in a plant cell?","completion":"The outermost structure in a plant cell is known as the cell wall, which plays a vital role in maintaining the shape and rigidity of the cell. The cell wall is a protective layer composed primarily of carbohydrates, mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. It forms a network of complex structural fibrous materials that helps the cell maintain its shape, provide mechanical strength, and protect the cell from damage, pathogens, and environmental stressors. The cell wall also plays a crucial role in cell growth, communication, and various physiological processes. Composition of the cell wall: 1. Cellulose: Cellulose is the primary component of the plant cell wall. It is a linear polymer that consists of thousands of glucose molecules linked together by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds forming a cellulose microfibril. These microfibrils are bundled together to form larger structures called cellulose fibers. This structural arrangement provides the cell wall with tensile strength and rigidity. 2. Hemicellulose: Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous group of polysaccharides that cross-link cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall, helping to maintain their structure. They are composed of various sugar units such as xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, forming a branched structure. Hemicellulose interactions with cellulose fibers contribute to the cell wall's mechanical properties. 3. Pectin: Pectins are a group of complex polysaccharides found in the cell wall, primarily composed of galacturonic acid and other sugar units, which form a gel-like matrix. Pectins contribute to the cell wall's porosity, hydration, and flexibility by forming hydrogen bonds with cellulose and hemicellulose. They play a significant role in cell adhesion and plant growth, as well as in the defense against pathogens. 4. Proteins: Various proteins are embedded within the plant cell wall. These proteins serve multiple functions, such as structural reinforcement, enzymatic activities, communication pathways for signaling molecules, and defense against pathogens. Examples include structural proteins like extensin and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), as well as enzymes like cellulases and pectinases, which help modify the cell wall during plant growth and development. 5. Lignin: Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer that provides additional structural support and rigidity to the cell wall, particularly in specialized structures such as xylem vessels. Lignin also plays a vital role in water and nutrient transport by imparting waterproofing properties to the cell walls, especially in vascular plants. Moreover, it contributes to the plant's defense by forming a physical barrier against pathogens and herbivores. In summary, the outermost structure in a plant cell, the cell wall, is a complex, dynamic, and essential component, crucial for overall plant health, growth, and adaption to environmental conditions. Its primary components, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, proteins, and lignin, provide strength, flexibility, structural support, and protection to the cells, enabling plants to thrive and adapt to their surroundings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael advises girls to try their poses in the backstage in order to avoid wasting time on the set and to cold . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not mean exactly the same thing. There are subtle differences in meaning, sentence structure, and word choice that distinguish the two statements. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the differences. 1) \\"Michael advises the girls to try their poses in the cold to avoid wasting time on set and get backstage.\\" In this sentence, Michael is suggesting that the girls practice their poses in a cold environment. This recommendation is made with the intention of minimizing time spent on the set, allowing the girls to quickly proceed backstage after posing. Here, the primary concern appears to be efficiency in terms of time management on set. The sentence implies that the girls may be currently in a cold environment and preparing their poses there would save time. 2) \\"Michael advises girls to try their poses in the backstage in order to avoid wasting time on the set and to cold.\\" In this sentence, Michael is recommending that the girls practice their poses backstage instead of on the set. The purpose of this suggestion is to avoid wasting time on the set and to avoid 'cold,' which is used ambiguously and likely needs clarification. The intended meaning could either be 'to avoid feeling cold' or 'to avoid being exposed to cold conditions' while posing on the set. In this case, Michael's focus is not only on time management but also on keeping the girls comfortable and avoiding the cold. To sum up, while both sentences convey similar ideas – Michael advising the girls to practice their poses to save time and avoid discomfort – the nuances and contexts differ. The first sentence emphasizes practicing poses in a cold environment, while the second sentence focuses on practicing backstage to avoid cold conditions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It was the worst attack on Kenyan soil since the 1998 US embassy bombing by al-Qaeda - leaving 67 people dead and more than 200 wounded. The military, police and spy agency have been battling to save face over the handling of the rescue operation. Here are five key issues that remain unresolved: Initially, the police and members of the public tried to repel the attack. As hours went by, the government sent in the military. Rivalry between the two forces started when a commander of the police elite squad was killed in friendly fire by the military. The changeover angered the police and they left in protest as the army took control of the building. A military commander involved in the operation, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that is when things started to go wrong. \\"We entered the mall blindly with no guide, with no concept of anything. Command and control was not there,\\" he said. \\"The police felt they were undermined. The military thought the police didn't want to give them enough information so everything went wrong.\\" Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku maintains the operation was handled well. \\"I am happy with the way police responded. However, it was necessary for the military to bring protective gear and armoured carriers and their skill. As a country we are happy how they worked together.\\" Somalia's al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabab, said it had attacked the mall because Kenya sent troops to Somalia to bolster the UN-backed government. Kenya's military spokesman named four of the gunmen as Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr. \\"I confirm those are the names of the terrorists,\\" Major Emmanuel Chirchir tweeted at the time. All four were said to have crossed over the border from Somalia before the attack. It is thought the names given by the military may be noms de guerre as one of the gunmen was subsequently identified as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin. Voices from the mall Recovered remains of the alleged attackers are still undergoing forensic tests by the FBI. Kenya's chief pathologist Johannes Oduor, who was part of the team initially examining them, says he was unable to confirm if the bodies were those of the attackers. \\"I am still waiting for the report,\\" he says. Mr Ole Lenku says the report on forensic analysis samples may be able to answer these questions. \\"Until we get it we can't give any concrete information on their identities to establish their names and nationalities.\\" President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to form a commission of inquiry to investigate the attack and any failings by security agencies. But to date nothing has happened. \\"We did promise, but parliament took up the process and did their best and came up with a report that actually necessitated a number of actions towards improving the country's security,\\" Mr Ole Lenku says. But no-one was sacked or held responsible as a result of the MPs' report, released in March. Security analysts say a public inquiry into Westgate could have been embarrassing. The parliamentary investigation was a way of protecting the military, which had been criticised following allegations that soldiers looted shops in Westgate, they say. The military was accused of looting when CCTV footage emerged showing soldiers carrying bags out of the shopping centre. When merchants returned to Westgate they found most of their shops had been vandalised. Pictures circulating on social media revealed shelves, cash drawers and safes broken into. The government said the soldiers with carrier bags were helping themselves to water from a supermarket to quench their thirst during the operation. In October, two soldiers were named, charged and jailed for the looting. Victor Otieno and Victor Ashihundu were court-martialled but their sentences have not been made public. They were allegedly found in possession of mobile phones, cameras and battery chargers. The government promised to pay compensation to survivors and help settle their medical bills. But those contacted by the BBC say this has not happened. \\"It's been tough because I don't have any income,\\" says Anne Moraa, a manager of a shop selling handbags in Westgate, who was trampled as she tried to escape. She had to pay her own hospital bills. She is continuing to pay for counselling as she is too traumatised to go into any shopping centre. \\"We have been waiting for the government to compensate [us] - I haven't seen anything yet,\\" Ms Moraa says. \\"After Westgate many people went to hospital, the government didn't follow them up. There is no support group for survivors.\\" A military officer injured by a grenade thrown by one of the militants says he is also waiting. The grenade killed two of his colleagues. \\"I have not been compensated. Neither have the families of those soldiers that died in the attack. I have not been told anything. Maybe it's in the process and has not been communicated to us,\\" said the soldier, who is still receiving treatment for his injuries. Mr Ole Lenku told the BBC he could not comment on these cases. \\"I know the concern has been raised but it involves a lot of variables,\\" he said.

Here is another sentence: His cold deprived him of his sense of taste. Does the term taste mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"No, the term \\"taste\\" does not mean the same thing in both of these sentences. In the English language, certain words can have multiple meanings based on the context in which they are used. In this case, the word \\"taste\\" has two different meanings in the given sentences. In the first sentence, \\"She enjoyed her brief taste of independence\\", the word \\"taste\\" refers to a brief experience or sample of something. Here, the term is used metaphorically to describe the woman's enjoyment of a short period of independence. It implies that she had an opportunity to experience a situation or context in which she had more freedom or autonomy than she typically has. The focus of this usage is on the temporary nature of the experience and the pleasure or satisfaction she derived from it. In the second sentence, \\"His cold deprived him of his sense of taste\\", the word \\"taste\\" refers to one of the five primary senses that humans have. Specifically, it pertains to the ability to perceive and differentiate flavors in food and drink. The sense of taste works in conjunction with the sense of smell to help identify and enjoy various taste sensations, such as sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. In this context, the sentence explains that due to the man's cold, he was unable to properly taste the foods he consumed because his sense of taste was temporarily impaired, which is a common symptom of colds and other illnesses that affect the nasal passages and throat. In summary, the word \\"taste\\" has different meanings in the two given sentences. In the first sentence, it signifies a brief experience or sampling of a situation, whereas in the second sentence, it represents one of the primary human senses used to perceive flavors.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. President Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage is energizing Christian conservative support for Mitt Romney in a way that the likely GOP nominee has so far not been able to do on his own, according to religious leaders and activists. Pastors in Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and other swing states are readying Sunday sermons inveighing against same-sex unions, while activist groups have begun laying plans for social media campaigns, leaflet drives and other get-out-the-vote efforts centered on the same-sex marriage issue. Romney could benefit from a strong turnout among evangelicals and other social conservatives, many of whom remain skeptical of his commitment to their causes. “So many people were rather lukewarm toward governor Romney and were really looking for some more tangible reasons to support him,” said Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, who led the ballot drive that banned gay marriage in Ohio in 2004. “Then lo and behold, it just fell out of the sky when Obama came out and endorsed same-sex marriage. . . . We are going to make this our key issue: the attack on marriage.” The National Organization for Marriage, a leading anti-gay-marriage group, lashed out at Obama after his announcement and promised to campaign against him “ceaselessly” in swing states. Same-sex marriage has long been a galvanizing political force for core constituencies in both parties, particularly conservative Catholics and evangelical Republicans. But the president’s public embrace of the idea alters the landscape in ways that promise to complicate the political calculus for both sides. While more than 30 states now ban same-sex marriage and voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment forbidding it, anti-gay-marriage activists acknowledge that public opinion on the issue has shifted dramatically since 2004, when ballot measures in Ohio and 10 other states helped drive social conservatives to the polls in support of George W. Bush. Romney and other establishment Republicans have treaded softly on the issue so far, but many evangelicals think that a forceful anti-gay-marriage campaign could pay huge dividends for Republicans in the fall. Some on the religious right also remain deeply uncertain about Romney’s convictions on cultural issues and are unhappy with his statements in recent days that he supports allowing gay couples to adopt children and that he does not view same-sex marriage as a religious issue. Many activists say they will continue to push Romney on the issue. “Romney says he is for traditional marriage and then immediately says he is fine with homosexuals adopting children,” said David Lane, who organizes conservative pastors and congregations nationwide and helped lead anti-gay-marriage efforts in Iowa, California and other states. “Our base does not react well to that. They are not going to turn out [for a candidate] who tries to triangulate” on topics such as marriage and other traditional values. The sentiments underscore the continued difficulties that Romney faces in attempting to navigate thorny cultural issues while attempting to woo independent voters with an economic message. Romney is slated to appear Saturday at Liberty University, an evangelical bastion in Lynchburg, Va., where he will deliver a commencement address. Romney says he is opposed to same-sex marriage and civil unions and favors a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages nationwide. But the former Massachusetts governor has also said that the “tender and sensitive” issue will not be a central part of his campaign. Justin Peery, 27, a Virginia filmmaker who will attend Romney’s speech at Liberty, said he plans to vote for Romney this fall but is not passionate about his candidacy. That could change, he said, if Romney firmly denounced Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. “I don’t think it’s by coincidence that Obama came out in favor of gay marriage days before Romney will speak to a crowd of evangelicals,” Peery said. “If he talks about his opposition in a very clear way, he’ll probably get many, many standing ovations.” Same-sex marriage does not appear to be the galvanizing force it once was, particularly among younger voters. A poll last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 44 percent of young white evangelicals favor allowing gay and lesbian people to marry, compared with 12 percent of evangelical seniors and 19 percent of evangelicals overall. Some conservatives hope the issue drives a wedge between black voters, who largely oppose same-sex marriage, and the president. The Rev. John Coats II, who leads an African American church in Columbus, Ohio, said his Facebook page erupted on Wednesday with critical comments about the president from people who had previously defended him. He is already preparing to preach on Sunday posing the question: Why doesn’t the black community produce politicians who reflect the community’s values? “I’m not saying they will be pushed to the point to vote for Romney,” Coats said of black voters. “But I believe it will increase voter apathy, and I have to say I’m surprised, and somewhat delightfully, that people are taking a closer look at this president who would never do that before.” In Ohio, Burress said his group plans to re-create many of the tactics used in 2004 to spur social conservatives to the polls, including organizing rallies and meetings and placing tens of thousands of fliers in church bulletins across the state. The group will also renew its alliance with Amish voters there, who turned out in record numbers for the 2004 ballot measure, Burress said. Aggressive use of Facebook, text messaging and other social media technologies will help amplify the message, he and others said. “This could really be a difference-maker,” said J.C. Church, pastor of the 600-member Victory in Truth Ministries congregation in Bucyrus, Ohio, north of Columbus. “People will get fired up on this issue. North Carolina is an indication — this will awaken the conservative evangelicals to become aware, and the result will be action.” But Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, said changing demographics and the struggling economy mean that same-sex marriage may not prove as central as it was eight years ago in the state. While he supports Romney’s position on the issue, he said the GOP presidential candidate would do best to focus on jobs and other economic issues. “In Ohio, there are people on both sides of the issue who have largely made up their minds,” Bennett said. “Obviously it’s going to unite the social conservatives who maybe had some doubts about Romney, but there are other issues to unite people. This is more of a sidebar issue now.” Staff writers Tom Hamburger in Washington and Krissah Thompson in Lynchburg, Va., contributed to this report. ||||| President Barack Obama has seen an uptick in fundraising since he announced his shift on gay marriage, with some Democratic rainmakers citing renewed interest from gay and lesbian donors who had been urging the president to clarify his stance on the divisive social issue. President Barack Obama returns a salute as he steps off the Marine One helicopter prior to boarding Air Force One at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, Friday, May 11, 2012. (AP Photo/Pablo... (Associated Press) \\"The phone calls went on until one in the morning after the president spoke _ people calling saying \`Where do I go, what can I do to help, what events are coming up,'\\" said Robert Zimmerman, a Long Island, N.Y., Obama bundler. \\"People I've been seeking out for campaign support for months have been calling me saying, \`I'm ready to give.'\\" Obama's campaign has declined to say how much it has collected since the announcement but some staffers have asked supporters to give money as a way of expressing their approval. Following the Obama interview with ABC News, Rufus Gifford, Obama's national finance director, said in a posting to the campaign website that \\"if you're proud of our president, this is a great time to make a donation to the campaign.\\" Chad Griffin, an Obama bundler and incoming president of the gay advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said most prominent gay donors had been supporting Obama all along despite his reluctance to champion gay marriage. Most had already given the maximum contribution to his campaign, Griffin said. But he said Obama's announcement had boosted enthusiasm among many gay donors. \\"There was a tad bit of uncomfortableness because of his position on marriage, even though most people saw where he was headed,\\" Griffin said. \\"The thing he did (Wednesday) cleared any uncomfortableness anyone had.\\" Obama said Wednesday he supported gay marriage, marking a shift in his personal view on the issue after once opposing it and saying more recently that his views were \\"evolving.\\" Even before the gay marriage news, Obama has long stressed his commitment to gay rights. The president repealed the military's 18-year-old ban on openly gay service members, called \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" and instructed the Justice Department last year to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Some gay rights advocates have pressed Obama to sign an executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians who work for companies with federal contracts. Obama was attending a New York fundraiser Monday with gay and lesbian donors hosted by singer Ricky Martin, his first fundraising event with gay supporters since his announcement. The president is scheduled to attend a major fundraiser with gay supporters in Los Angeles on June 6, with tickets priced as high as 25,000 per couple. Griffin, who is co-hosting the event, said he was confident it would sell out. At least one leading gay activist has said he will attend the June 6 event after pledging to withhold support for Obama if the president did not embrace gay marriage. Lance Black, and Academy Award-winning screenwriter based in Los Angeles, penned a column in the Hollywood Reporter last month saying he would not contribute to or vote for Obama and urged other gay activists to withhold support as well. Obama's statement Wednesday changed his mind, Black said. Now I can do all I can to help him financially. I am going to go big, and I'm not alone there,\\" Black said. \\"He blew me away (Wednesday).

I don't wanna feed 3 dogs at once How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"I don't wanna feed 3 dogs at once\\" can be described as negative, expressing reluctance or dissatisfaction with a specific situation. In this case, the task of feeding three dogs simultaneously seems to be perceived as a burden or challenge by the author of the tweet. However, there is no clear indication of the exact cause of the negative sentiment, such as whether it is the complexity of the task, the frustration with the dogs themselves, or a general feeling of not wanting to do this job at this particular moment. To better understand the negative sentiment, it is important to consider some key elements in the message: 1. The use of contractions: The author has shortened \\"do not\\" to \\"don't\\" and \\"want to\\" to \\"wanna.\\" This informal language may signify a casual or conversational tone, further emphasizing the feelings of discontent or reluctance. 2. The number \\"3\\": By specifying that there are three dogs, the author suggests that the task may be more difficult than feeding a single dog, which could contribute to the negative sentiment. 3. The action \\"feeding\\": Feeding can be a routine chore for pet owners, but it may also be seen as tedious or time-consuming. In this context, the author's dissatisfaction or disinterest in performing that task is highlighted. 4. The word \\"at once\\": This phrase emphasizes the idea that the task of feeding the three dogs has to be carried out simultaneously, which could imply a sense of urgency or an additional level of complexity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as negative, indicating the author's dissatisfaction or reluctance to feed three dogs at once. While it may be rooted in the perceived challenge or inconvenience of the task, the casual tone and informal language add to the overall sense of frustration or unwillingness to complete it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Much of his music, including operas, masses, and other large-scale vocal works, is lost. His reputation today rests on a set of programmatic keyboard sonatas published in 1700, in which each sonata depicted in detail a particular story from the Bible. After his death, Kuhnau was succeeded as \\"Thomaskantor\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. - Der beglückte Florindo ( HWV 3 ) is an opera composed by Handel at the request of Reinhard Keiser , the manager of the Hamburg Opera . It was first performed ( after Handel had left for Italy ) at the Theater am Gänsemarkt in January 1708 . It was probably directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner . The opera was the first part of a double opera , with the second part , Die verwandelte Daphne , intended to be performed on the following evening . Keiser inserted a play in low German , called die lustige Hochzeit , into the opera , afraid that the audience would get tired otherwise . Handel was not pleased , according to Romain Rolland . Only fragments of the score survive , but a copy of the libretto exists in the Library of Congress . The libretto was by Hinrich Hinsch , a lawyer , who also wrote the text for Keiser 's first opera in Hamburg : Mahumet II ( 1696 ) , based on the life of Mehmet II. Hinsch had been writing librettos since 1681 . He died in 1712 . - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann. - Reinhard Keiser (9 January 167412 September 1739) was a popular German opera composer based in Hamburg. He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades. - Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 in Kirchberg 10 May 1760 in Darmstadt) was a German harpsichordist and composer of high Baroque music who was a contemporary of Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Babies naturally explore the world through biting and hitting things around them. Hands and teeth are a child's first social tools. A child learns to use them to explore the things around them as well as the reactions she gets from others when she uses them. Biting and hitting is most common between the ages of 18 months and 2 1/2 years, while language is still developing. Biting usually stops as language develops, but hitting often continues for several years into early childhood. If your child is hitting in particular environments, such as at a particular child's house or at preschool, take a look at these places to see what might be causing her behavior. Consider the behavior as a nonverbal communication, and think about what she might be trying to communicate. Most children have shorter tempers when tired. Consider whether the hitting is happening at a particular time of day or in a limited number of situations. Consider the possibility that your child is responding to unkind behavior. Teasing and bullying often occur very subtly, in ways that your child may not be able to communicate. If this is the situation, you'll need to address those behaviors even as you teach your child alternatives to hitting. Teaching your child to identify her feelings is important. Anger, frustration, and jealousy are feelings, and feelings are natural and normal. Never make your child feel ashamed of having a feeling, even though you are trying to teach her alternative behaviors. Notice how you respond to your own feelings of anger. Use these moments to help teach your child alternatives to hitting. For example, if you get angry at someone, use your hand like a puppet. \\"Okay, hand, you feel angry, but no hitting, okay?\\" It might feel silly, but your child will get the message. Using words to identify your feelings will help your child better connect words to his own feelings. Saying out loud when you're feeling upset, angry or frustrated can help your child learn that these feelings are normal and okay. Follow up by stating what you're going to do to help yourself feel better. For example, you might say, \\"I feel angry, but I'll feel better if I take 5 big breaths.\\" Summary:","completion":"The article talks about how young children explore their world and express themselves using biting and hitting, and it provides suggestions for parents to help kids learn better ways to communicate their feelings as they grow up."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cooke, a Creator of Head Start, Dies at 93\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Robert E. Cooke, a Creator of Head Start, Dies at 93 Body: Robert E. Cooke, a renowned pediatrician and an instrumental figure in the creation of the influential Head Start educational program, passed away at the age of 93. A pioneer in early education, Dr. Cooke dedicated his life to supporting at-risk children and their families to ensure broader access to educational opportunities, developmental resources, and healthcare services. His legacy continues to inspire policymakers and educators today, as tens of millions of children have directly benefited from Head Start programs since their inception in 1965. Born on March 15, 1928, in New York City, Robert E. Cooke showed early proficiency in the sciences, which led him to pursue a degree in medicine. He completed his undergraduate degree at Yale University and then earned his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College. During his studies, Dr. Cooke focused on pediatrics, driven by an intrinsic passion for serving the needs of children and families. This passion propelled him throughout his distinguished career, shaping his professional pursuits and leaving an indelible mark on the field of early childhood education and healthcare. Dr. Cooke began his career in the mid-1950s at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he first noticed a pattern of gaps in the developmental and educational experiences of children living in low-income communities. He observed that these disadvantages were especially prevalent among children of color, leading to long-lasting disparities in educational attainment and health outcomes. Driven by a deep sense of responsibility to address these injustices, Dr. Cooke fervently advocated for policy changes and innovative solutions to improve the lives of these vulnerable children. In 1965, amidst the Civil Rights era and the War on Poverty initiated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Dr. Cooke was appointed to the President's task force on health and education, where he made a tremendous impact. Recognizing that early intervention could be a key driving force in closing achievement gaps and promoting equal access to opportunities, Dr. Cooke proposed a comprehensive, community-based program that would target the educational, health, and social-emotional development of children in need. Inspired by his dedication to this cause, the task force embraced his proposal, eventually resulting in the creation of the Head Start program. Since its establishment in 1965, Head Start has served over 36 million children and their families across the United States. The program provides low-income children aged 0-5 with early education, healthcare services, nutritional support, and parent involvement programs, all aiming to foster healthy development and long-term success. Dr. Cooke's vision for early intervention has been remarkably successful, with studies showing that children who participate in Head Start programs exhibit significant improvements in academic achievement, cognitive skills, and emotional development compared to their non-Head Start counterparts. Head Start graduates are also more likely to complete high school, pursue higher education, and secure stable employment. Dr. Robert E. Cooke's contributions to early childhood education and health extend beyond the establishment of the Head Start program. Throughout his career, Dr. Cooke held numerous esteemed positions, such as professor and chairman of the pediatrics department at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine. He was also the recipient of numerous awards and honors for his lifelong dedication to children's wellbeing. The death of Dr. Robert E. Cooke at the age of 93 leaves behind a transformative legacy in early childhood education and healthcare. As a pioneer in the field and a tireless advocate for children and families in need, his work has left an indelible impact on the lives of millions of children around the country. As we mourn the passing of this luminary figure, we also celebrate his remarkable achievements and remember his enduring vision for a more equitable society, where all children have the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: The two friends are having fun. This statement informs us that two individuals, who are friends, are engaging in some enjoyable activity. However, it does not explicitly mention the type of activity they are participating in. Hypothesis: Two friends play a game together. In this statement, we have a specific scenario where two friends are engaged in playing a game together. Now, let's assess the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve two friends. 2. The premise states that the friends are having fun, whereas the hypothesis suggests a specific type of fun activity, playing a game. If the hypothesis was true, it would be completely consistent with the premise: playing a game together is an example of an activity that could be fun for two friends. However, the premise does not provide enough information to exclusively conclude the hypothesis. There could be many other activities that the two friends are having fun doing. They might be watching a movie, attending a concert, or engaging in a stimulating conversation. The list of potential activities that friends can have fun doing is expansive.

Military forces loyal to the country's National Transitional Council took a CNN crew Thursday to the site, not far from Sabha in the Sahara desert. The crew saw two large warehouses there, one containing thousands of blue barrels, some marked with tape saying \\"radioactive,\\" and several plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape. The material has not been confirmed as being radioactive, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, confirmed Thursday that the Libyan government had yellowcake stored near Sabha.

Q: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who held his body stiff as he faced the CAthar Fortress? Available options: [1]. Dominican friar; [2]. Roland; [3]. not enough information; [4]. Diana; The answer is:","completion":"[2]. Roland"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band of the 1970s and early 1980s. The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous. Due to creative and financial disagreements, Vitous left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound. 1976's Black Market album was perhaps the most rock-oriented work which the group had produced to date. Weather Report's music had evolved further from open-ended funk jams into more melody-oriented, concise forms, which also offered a greater mass-market appeal. Zawinul further consolidated his use of keyboard synthesizers, while Shorter experimented with an early form of wind synthesizer, the Lyricon. However, the album was recorded during yet another period of change for the group, with multiple personnel shuffles. Although Alyrio Lima played percussion on one track, he was replaced during the sessions by Don Alias (his first appearance with the group since the debut album debacle) and by Alex Acuna (a Peruvian drummer and conga player based in Las Vegas, who had played with Elvis Presley and Ike Turner, among others). Alphonso Johnson was also worn out from the strain put on the rhythm by the band's frequent changes of drummer. During a break in activity halfway through the recording of Black Market, Johnson opted to leave Weather Report to play with the Billy Cobham/George Duke Band (which featured a young John Scofield on guitar). Prior to his departure, Johnson played on all but two of the new album's tracks. His replacement was Jaco Pastorius, a virtuoso fretless bass guitarist from Florida, who had been in touch with Zawinul for several years, and who came in to play on \\"Cannon Ball\\" and his own composition \\"Barbary Coast\\". Zawinul and Shorter had assumed that Chester Thompson would be departing alongside his friend Johnson, and for the second set of sessions they replaced him (on Jaco Pastorius' recommendation) with the former Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Narada Michael Walden. Although Walden played on several album tracks, he ultimately proved unsuitable. Thompson returned for the final Black Market sessions, but left again after failing to gel as a rhythm section with Pastorius (whose style was much busier than that of Johnson). Thompson subsequently joined Genesis as their touring drummer. Black Market continued Weather Report's ongoing run of success, selling well and being the fourth of the band's albums to win the album of the year award from Down Beat magazine. For the subsequent tour, Alex Acuna moved from percussion to the drum kit, and Don Alias was replaced by the young Puerto Rican percussionist Manolo Badrena, who had previously played with various Latin rock bands and with Art Blakey. The band made a very well-received appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was filmed for future release.

Write the next sentence in the following story. How to build self‐control Recognize impulsive thoughts. Having strategies to help you resist temptation in the moment will help you build self-control. Start by making a list of the behaviors you'd like to control and the situations that often trigger the behavior.","completion":"Next, analyze the patterns that emerge in these situations and identify the thought processes that lead to impulsive actions. For instance, you might notice that emotional stress or fatigue often precedes such behaviors. Understanding these warning signs can empower you to preemptively avoid the triggers or adopt coping mechanisms before the situations arise. One effective approach to enhance self-control is by employing the \\"if-then\\" strategy. With this technique, you preemptively plan a certain response whenever a specific trigger occurs. For example, you could tell yourself \\"If I feel stressed and want to eat junk food, then I will take a few deep breaths and drink a glass of water instead.\\" Another vital component of self-control is learning to delay gratification. This means enduring short-term discomfort, so you can reap long-term benefits. By frequently practicing delayed gratification, you can gradually train your brain to resist impulses and maintain focus on long-term goals. One way to develop this skill is by engaging in activities that require patience, such as reading a book, meditating, or working on complex puzzles. Moreover, it's important to recognize that willpower can be depleted over time - a phenomenon known as \\"ego depletion.\\" To counteract this, ensure you have adequate rest and relaxation periods, as this regeneration allows your self-control reserves to replenish. Establishing a healthy sleep routine, eating nutritiously, and engaging in regular physical activity can help increase your overall willpower levels. Having a reliable support network can also be a significant factor in building self-control. Share your goals and progress with friends, family, or even supportive online communities that can provide the motivation, inspiration, and accountability you need to stay on course. Additionally, consider seeking professional assistance from therapists, coaches, or counselors who can help you devise personalized strategies for self-control. Tracking your progress can be incredibly helpful in this process. Maintain a dedicated journal or a progress-tracking app to document your journey toward enhanced self-control. Make note of any successful instances of impulse resistance, as well as any lapses that may occur. This self-reflection will help you gauge your progress, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate milestones as you reach them. Lastly, remember that self-control is a continuous and evolving process. Everyone experiences setbacks at times, but cultivating a growth mindset and embracing the idea that self-control can be strengthened with practice will guide you on your path to success. Always be compassionate with yourself in the face of challenges and strive to learn from each experience, using these insights to develop even more effective self-control strategies for the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events. All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\". The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan on 29 November 1983 was released on 27 February 2008, as Last Live Show. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

Plot title: Superman: Doomsday Movie plot: Lois Lane (Anne Heche) and Superman (Adam Baldwin) are romantically involved, but Lois is unsatisfied with keeping their relationship secretive and confined to the Fortress of Solitude. While digging for a project, workers from LexCorp unearth the spaceship of Doomsday, a genetically-engineered super-soldier. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a bloody rampage towards Metropolis. Superman and Doomsday engage in a battle until Superman kills Doomsday and succumbs to his own injuries. Lex Luthor (James Marsters) kills his personal assistant Mercy Graves to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. The world mourns and Metropolis honors him with a memorial. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways: Jimmy Olsen takes a job at a tabloid newspaper, the National Voyeur, Perry White becomes an alcoholic, and Lois, who realized that Clark was Superman, visits Martha Kent for counsel. In Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by criminals. Toyman uses a giant mechanical spider to hold children hostage. Lois decides to save them herself, but Toyman tries to kill her and a little girl. Superman digs out of his grave and saves Lois, apprehending Toyman. He doesn't seem quite the same but Lois dismisses it as shock. She becomes suspicious, however, when Martha tells her Clark has not called home. The resurrected Superman is revealed to be a clone created by Lex from a blood sample retrieved after the Doomsday battle.

My question: How does Lex hope to kill the clone?

In the movie plot provided, Lex Luthor periodically tortures the clone Superman in a special lead-lined room with red sunlight, which weakens Superman (and by extension, his clone), as Superman's powers are derived from our yellow Sun. Furthermore, he uses kryptonite gauntlets. Kryptonite is a well-known substance that is harmful to Superman and his kin, causing them great physical distress and depleting their powers. Through this combination of red sunlight and exposure to Kryptonite, Lex Luthor intends to kill the clone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sure service is not so great the wait is pretty long but you came here for the food. I would've gave it a 3 star also but the food and frozen hot chocolate changed my mind. This was my third time here. Decent place to eat when you visit Vegas since the buffets aren't as great as they use to be........ Me and my friend got two orders to split in half to try them both, both were really excellent! I got the hangover omelette not the best but defitnitley one of my favorites it consisted of fries tomato bacon cheese and much more and it comes with a side of sweet potato or regular fries. Overall a great omelette. My buddy got the blue cheese burger. The burger was very well grilled the bun was nice and fresh and the blue cheese was the perfect complement with the bacon and beef.

First question: How does an imessage appear to the sender when I'm in airplane mode? Second question: Can Apple tell me what time it was when I put my iPhone on airplane mode? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: -no -yes","completion":"First question: How does an iMessage appear to the sender when I'm in airplane mode? When you put your iPhone in airplane mode, it disables the cellular and wireless connections. As a result, your device cannot send or receive any iMessages, text messages, or calls. When someone sends you an iMessage while your phone is in airplane mode, the message will remain undelivered on their end until you turn off airplane mode and reconnect to the internet (either via Wi-Fi or cellular data). To the sender, the iMessage will appear showing a status of \\"Delivered\\" once it has been successfully delivered to your device. However, if you are in airplane mode, their message will show a status of \\"Sending...\\" or \\"Not Delivered\\" under the iMessage text bubble. Depending on the sender's settings, they may also see a red exclamation mark next to the message, indicating that the message could not be delivered. It is essential to understand that the iMessage won't show \\"Read\\" status on the sender's device until you actually read the message after turning off the airplane mode and reconnecting to the internet. Second question: Can Apple tell me what time it was when I put my iPhone on airplane mode? Apple cannot directly tell you the exact time you enabled airplane mode on your iPhone. The only way to determine when airplane mode was enabled is by checking your own device. You could use your memory or look at the time-stamps on any messages, calls, or notifications received right before entering airplane mode. Regrettably, there is no built-in feature that logs or records the times airplane mode is toggled on or off. However, if you have Location Services enabled on your device, you may be able to get a rough idea of when your device was disconnected from cellular or Wi-Fi by checking your location history within Apple Maps. This solution will not give you the exact time but an approximation of when you lost connection by looking at your last updated location tied to a timestamp. To answer the final question, these two questions are not the same. They address separate issues related to airplane mode on an iPhone. The first question focuses on the sender's perspective when sending iMessages to a recipient in airplane mode, while the second question is related to determining the time you enabled airplane mode on your device. Therefore, the answer to whether these questions are asking the same thing is: - No"},{"prompt":"About 45 percent of Americans don't get enough sleep, according to a recent survey.

Just over half of all households in the country own at least one Apple product, a new survey says, showing just how far the reach of the company has come in the last decade. At the turn of the 21st century, Apple was in rough shape. It had narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and Steve Jobs' return as CEO a few years earlier was turning the company around, but the market share of its products -- then almost exclusively Mac computers -- was dismal, at about 2% worldwide. Then came the iPod, which begat the iPhone and the iPad. As Apple's gadgets gobbled up market share (and in some cases created new markets), its Macs experienced a rebound, too. Now, according to CNBC's All-American Economic Survey, 51% of U.S. households own at least one Apple product. Few brands have such a deep reach among American consumers. Certainly, product categories such as refrigerators or even smartphones have achieved even deeper penetration, but looking at single companies, it's a short list with probable names such as GE (light bulbs) or 3M (Scotch tape). Reducing to just technology companies would make it even shorter. See also: Sorry, Google: Apple is America's Valentine This Year [study]. Of the households that own Apple products, they own an average of three, making the overall ownership rate of the American public 1.6 Apple products per household. About 25% plan to buy another Apple product in the next year. The survey shows Apple buyers tend to skew male, young, with higher education and incomes (77% of households making 75,000 or more have an Apple product). If you have kids, the likelihood of being an Apple household grows -- 61% compared with 48% if you don't. As far as politics is concerned, both Republicans and Democrats appear to like Apple products equally, with 56% of people counting themselves a member of either party owning Apple, although a greater portion of Democrats plan to buy more products soon. CNBC's survey polled 836 Americans via both landlines and cellphones over three days in March. The network says it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4%. Do you own Apple products?

First, the question asks what one must do if they want to buy something. This implies that there is a necessary action required to complete the purchasing process. 2. When considering the options, \\"spend money\\" directly relates to the act of buying something, as it involves exchanging money for the desired item. This is a fundamental aspect of purchasing, so it is the most appropriate answer. 3. \\"Go shopping\\" and \\"a shop\\" are related to the process of finding and acquiring items to purchase but do not represent the actual requirement of making a purchase. 4. \\"Paying\\" closely relates to \\"spend money,\\" but it is not as direct. Paying can also be in the form of exchanging goods or services rather than just spending money. Thus, \\"spend money\\" is a more accurate answer. 5. \\"Have in mind\\" is not directly related to the act of purchasing.

British Designer Is at it Again, Debuts 17.7 Million Diamond Dress It looks like Debbie Wingham took the adage “diamonds are a girl’s best friend,” seriously. The British designer debuted her latest creation: a red diamond-encrusted dress valued at a whopping 17.7 million (£11.7 million). Dubbed the “Abaya,” the dress is a loose black gown inspired by traditional North African and Arabic attire worn by some women in parts of the Islamic world, NBC Today reported. (PHOTOS: Fashion Month in 75 Photos: Trends from New York, London, Milan and Paris) The dress is simple, except that there’s 2,000 stones embellished on it. One of which, at the center of the garment, is a rare and expensive red diamond, apparently worth 7.4 million. The dress also has 50 2-carat white diamonds, 50 2-carat black diamonds and 1,899 pointer diamonds, all of which are set in platinum. But this blinged-out number isn’t the first from Wingham. Last September the designer debuted her 5.7 million Little Black Dress at Kiev Fashion Week, and launched a collection of diamond-studded jeans soon afterwards. If you’re hoping to get your hands on the pricey Abaya, you’ll have to think again. The designer told NBC Today that the red diamond is borrowed and because of its rarity she wouldn’t be able to get another one. “The dress will never be sold, it’s a show piece,” she said.

With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers.

Second question: Why aren't there a lot of Muslim cricketers in the Indian cricket team? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"[1]. No The two questions you've asked are not asking the same thing, they pertain to different aspects of cricket in India. Now, to answer your questions in detail: 1. The selection in an Indian cricket team, especially at a national level, involves a few steps. Here are details on that process: • Local Club and School Teams: Start by practicing and honing your skills at a local level by playing in school teams, local cricket club or in district cricket leagues. This is primarily to gain experience and understand the intricacies of the game better. • Cricket Academies: Next, you might want to consider joining a cricket academy. These academies have experienced coaches who can help refine your skills and teach you the advanced technicalities of cricket. • District Level Cricket: By playing for your local or district cricket leagues, you may be noticed by state selectors. They choose proficient players and offer them a chance to play at the state level. • State Level and First Class Cricket: If your performance at the district level stands out, you'll be given opportunity to represent your state. Playing well at the state level can give you an entry into Ranji Trophy, the premier domestic cricket championship in India. • National Level: Consistently good performances in these tournaments may attract attention of the national selectors who are always on the lookout for potential players for the Indian cricket team. • Performance at Every Level: Keep in mind that it's not only about reaching these various levels, it's mainly about performing exceptionally at each level. For you to rise through this hierarchy, your performance, dedication and resilience matter the most. • Age Groups: Also, there are age-group tournaments like the U-16, U-19 and U-23 conducted by BCCI. By performing well in these tournaments, you get a chance to play for India A and India U-19 teams. It's to be noted that joining a cricket academy is not compulsory but can be very beneficial for improved training and guidance, especially from a very young age. 2. About the representation of different religions in sports, it's essential to understand that selection for the Indian cricket team is based on merit and not on religion or any other communal basis. There are several Muslim cricketers, like Zaheer Khan, Mohammad Shami, Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan, who have represented India internationally. It's just that the number might be proportional to the population distribution and also interest and access to facilities and opportunities in the particular sport within different communities. Furthermore, talent doesn't discriminate on the basis of religion. It could also be that more Muslim players are not making it to the national team because they are not passing through the rigorous selection and performance criteria set by BCCI, not because of their religion. Talent, consistent performance, fitness, and discipline – these are aspects that determine a cricketer's journey to the Indian team.

This movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. Judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

The photo shoot took place in a beautifully lit and thoughtfully designed studio, which served as a safe and comfortable space for the survivors to express themselves and their creativity. Each woman was encouraged to choose clothing and accessories from Rupa's collection that resonated with her personal style and allowed her to feel confident and beautiful.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write an article that answers the following question: What happened first: Battle of Poitiers or Edward permitted John to return to Brittany?","completion":"Writing an article involves several steps, such as understanding the topic, researching, sorting out relevant data, and articulating them in a structured manner. In this case, the topic at hand involves historical events: the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's permission for John to return to Brittany. Step 1: Understand the Topic Firstly, we need to clearly understand the task in hand. The user wants an article that answers the question of which event occurred first: the Battle of Poitiers, or Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany. To write this article, we'll need to do research and determine the timings of these two historical events. Step 2: Research The Battle of Poitiers refers to one of two major historical events – the Battle of Poitiers in 732 where Charles Martel stopped the Arab advance into Western Europe or the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 during the Hundred Years' War. Since we are comparing it with an event involving English and Breton nobility, it's likely the latter scenario, as the Hundred Years' War involved England and France. Edward, in this instance, likely refers to Edward I of England (reigned 1272-1307). John is presumably John I, Duke of Brittany (reigned 1237-1286). Research reveals that Edward I allowed John I to return to Brittany around 1274. Step 3: Analyze the Information Upon analyzing the research data, it is seen that Edward I's permission to John to return to Brittany was in the 13th century, specifically around 1274, whilst the Battle of Poitiers relevant to the English monarchy took place in the 14th century, in 1356 to be precise. Step 4: Construct the Article Now that we've gathered and analyzed the necessary data, it's time to write an article detailing the findings. I'll ensure the article is informative and organized, with a clear statement answering the initial question. Step 5: Proofread and Review After writing the article, it's crucial to proofread for any potential errors and ensure the article is cohesive, relevant, and accurate. Here's how the article might look: Title: Which Happened First: The Battle of Poitiers or Edward Granting Permission to John to Return to Brittany? History is a grand tapestry, interwoven with countless threads of events. One might find themselves wondering about the sequence of past events, like the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's allowance for John to return to Brittany. This article clarifies which of these events happened first. To identify which occurred first, we first need to pinpoint the time frames of these events. The Battle of Poitiers involved in this comparison occurred during the Hundred Years' War in the year 1356. This was a decisive battle between the kingdoms of England and France. On the other hand, the event of Edward I, King of England, permitting John I, Duke of Brittany, to return to his dukedom is documented to have happened significantly earlier, around 1274, during Edward's reign. From the analysis, it becomes clear that Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany happened first, predating the Battle of Poitiers by about 82 years. Therefore, even within the intricate panorama of history, chronology unravels the sequence of events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: Since you will be painting on your plywood, you want it to have a smooth texture. Signboard is a great option, but if you can’t get it, sanded plywood or medium-density fiberboard will also work. A common size is 4 by 4 feet (120 by 120 cm), but you can make your barn quilt whatever size you want. A smaller one is an easy way to start. A lumberyard or a home supply store are good places to look for plywood. Do your priming and painting outside or in an open garage. Lay down drop clothes to protect the floor if you are painting on the ground. You can also put your plywood on top of sawhorses or on a work table. If you don’t have ventilation when you paint, the paint fumes can be really harmful. Pour primer into a rolling tray, and dip your paint roller into it. Rub the paint roller along the plywood in smooth, even strokes. It’s important to use an exterior primer, since barn quilts are normally hung outdoors. Allow the coat to dry, following the instructions on the primer. Different kinds of primer will take different amounts of time to dry, so check the instructions on your can of primer to figure out how long you need to let it sit. Then paint on the second coat just as you did the first one. Let the primer dry again. You need to prime the back of your board as well, even though you won’t be painting it. This helps keep your artwork waterproof, since the barn quilt will have to withstand the weather outdoors. Be patient and wait for the primer to dry in between each coat. It will help your quilt last much longer.","completion":"To prepare plywood for painting a barn quilt, choose a smooth-textured material like signboard, sanded plywood, or medium-density fiberboard.

Police believe relatives of the elderly pair feared the women had been possessed by demons and were responsible for the illness. Local police spokesman Emmanuel Mahoko said traditional healer Maxwell Pira summoned both pensioners to a gathering before passing round a mystery liquid in a cup. The officer said: 'Pira gathered all family members and started praying for them. 'He also said prayers for a liquid which he called \\"holy water\\".

Write an article that answers the following question: Which group from the census is larger: Irish or Polish?","completion":"Title: Irish or Polish: A Dive into Census Data to Determine the Larger Group Introduction: While pondering over ethnically diverse communities, one might find oneself questioning: which group is larger, the Irish or the Polish? To answer this question, we must rely on reliable and accurate data from national census records, specifically focusing on their population statistics. In this article, we will examine the latest census data from both Ireland and Poland and deduce which ethnic group constitutes a larger portion of the population. Step 1: Research on reliable sources for census data To ensure the most accurate information, it is essential to find the latest official national census data for both countries. National census can be obtained from government agencies like the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland and the Central Statistical Office (GUS) in Poland. Step 2: Analyze the Irish census The most recent Irish census took place in 2016, with the next one scheduled for 2021. In 2016, the Irish population was reported at approximately 4.76 million people. According to the Central Statistics Office, the majority of the population identified themselves as ethnically Irish, with certain individuals belonging to other minority ethnic groups such as Polish living in the country. Step 3: Analyze the Polish census The latest Polish census was conducted in 2011, with a more recent one planned for 2021 or 2022. The population of Poland as of 2011 was approximately 38.5 million people. Just like in Ireland, most individuals residing in the country identified themselves as ethnically Polish, with minority groups such as the Romani, Belarusians, and Ukrainians, among others, comprising smaller portions of the population. Step 4: Compare the results With the Irish population at around 4.76 million and the Polish population at around 38.5 million, it is clear that the ethnically Polish group is significantly larger than the ethnically Irish group. Step 5: Consider potential external factors It is important to acknowledge that census data may not always provide a complete picture of the actual sizes of these communities globally. External factors such as immigration and emigration patterns, births, and deaths between the time of census collection and the present day may influence final figures. However, given the significant gap between the populations, it is reasonable to conclude that the ethnically Polish group is larger than the ethnically Irish group. Conclusion: Based on the available census data from the Central Statistics Office in Ireland and the Central Statistical Office in Poland, we can conclude that the ethnically Polish group is larger than the ethnically Irish group. It is vital to examine official census data using a careful and systematic approach to ensure the accuracy of the information being presented. While acknowledging the potential impact of external factors, we can confidently recognize the Polish as a more significant demographic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She has two brothers, Martin and Steve, who plays in her concert band as of 2017, and a sister, Gina. Martina's parents, Daryl and Jeanne Schiff, owned a dairy farm. Daryl, who was also a cabinetry shop owner, exposed Martina to country music at a young age. Released in 1995, Wild Angels accounted for another top five hit in its lead single \\"Safe in the Arms of Love\\", which had previously been recorded by both Wild Choir and Baillie & the Boys, and was concurrently released in Canada by Michelle Wright at the time of McBride's version. The album's title track went on to become McBride's first No. 1 single on the country charts in early 1996. However, the three follow-ups,\\"Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town\\", \\"Swingin' Doors\\" and \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" were less successful, reaching the lower regions of the top 40. In early 1997, after \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" peaked, McBride released two duets. \\"Still Holding On\\", a duet with Clint Black which was the lead-off single to her album Evolution and his album Nothin' but the Taillights, and \\"Valentine\\", a collaboration with pop pianist Jim Brickman which appeared on his album Picture This. She also sang duet vocals on \\"Chances Are\\" with Bob Seger, featured on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture Hope Floats. She had her second number one on the country charts with \\"A Broken Wing\\", the second single from her album Evolution, in late 1997 This album went on to produce four more top ten hits at country radio: a re-release of \\"Valentine\\", \\"Happy Girl\\", \\"Wrong Again\\" (which also went to number one), and \\"Whatever You Say\\". Towards the end of 1998, the album was certified double platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling two million units. In addition, she also won the Country Music Association Awards' \\"Female Vocalist of the Year\\" award in 1999 and also performed for President Bill Clinton during the same time. Also in 1998, McBride released a Christmas album titled White Christmas, which featured a rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" that first charted in 1997 and continued to re-enter the charts until 2001.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What do many people do to their water before storing it?\\" Context: \\"Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Many people, especially in developing countries, treat and disinfect their water before storing it to ensure its safety for drinking and other household purposes. Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is one such method widely accepted and recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization. This method, as mentioned, involves the use of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles that are filled with water and then exposed to sunlight for varying lengths of time, depending on the weather and climatic conditions. The treatment period ranges from a minimum of six hours up to two days during fully overcast conditions. The process of solar water disinfection works by leveraging the natural germicidal properties of sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation helps inactivate a wide range of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, in the water. Moreover, when combined with an increase in water temperature (thermal inactivation), this treatment method becomes even more effective in eradicating harmful pathogens. The utilization of PET bottles further ensures that the water stored remains uncontaminated. These bottles, when adequately cleaned and sealed, prevent the entry of dust, pollutants, and insects, thus maintaining the quality of the treated water. This method of water treatment has been widely adopted by over two million individuals, particularly in rural and remote areas where access to clean drinking water is limited or nonexistent. Due to its simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation, SODIS serves as an efficient and practical solution for addressing the urgent need for safe drinking water in these communities. In addition to being readily available, sunlight is a free and renewable resource that makes the SODIS method sustainable and environmentally friendly. There are a few essential factors that must be taken into consideration while using this method to achieve the best possible results: 1. The water source: The water to be treated needs to have low levels of turbidity or cloudiness, preferably below 30 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). If the water is too cloudy or includes large particles, it should be filtered or allowed to settle before filling the PET bottles. 2. Bottle preparation: The plastic PET bottles should be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed before use. Additionally, any labels or other obstructions should be removed, allowing for maximum exposure to sunlight. 3. Exposure duration: The time needed for sufficient disinfection depends on the weather conditions, intensity of sunlight, and the water's turbidity levels. In bright and sunny conditions, the treatment can be achieved in as little as six hours. However, during periods of cloudiness or low sunlight, the exposure time may extend up to two days. 4. Storage: Once treated, the water in the PET bottles should be stored in a clean and covered environment to maintain its quality and keep it safe for drinking. Ideally, bottles should be consumed within several days to reduce the risk of recontamination. It's important to note that while the SODIS method is effective in inactivating a significant number of pathogens, it might not be as efficient against certain resistant microorganisms, such as Cryptosporidium or some viruses. In such cases, additional treatment methods, like boiling or adding chlorine, may be necessary to ensure complete water safety. Nevertheless, solar water disinfection serves as a practical and cost-effective option for individuals and communities in developing countries, providing them with access to clean and safe drinking water, which is vital for their overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver.

Exponents of building, atmospheric drone-rock, influenced heavily by bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 they found a niche in the industry with a considerable underground following, but despite some attempts to commercialise their sound, this never crossed over into mainstream success. After splitting up in 2008, the band reformed in 2012 with Olley and Flower the only original members. - Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was \\"colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia\\" (Stephen Erlewine, \\"AllMusic\\"). Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a drug band due to the members drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band.

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892 September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Inquest: Gary Speed found by Louise Speed hanged at home - News Updated Nov 29, 2011 3:55 PM ET An inquest into the death of Gary Speed was told that the Wales manager was found hanged at his home by his wife. The 42-year-old was found dead at his Cheshire home on Sunday morning. Detective Inspector Peter Lawless, of Cheshire Police, told Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg that Speed's body was found by his wife Louise just before 7am. He said there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances and a post mortem examination found Speed's death was caused by hanging. The inquest has been adjourned until the end of January. Mr Rheinberg said: \\"I adjourn this inquest until January 30, 2012. The inquest will be heard in Warrington and will commence at 2pm.\\" There was a huge media presence at the inquest in Warrington but members of Speed's family did not attend. The coroner asked the media to \\"respect the privacy\\" of Speed's family, who said in statement on Monday that they had been overwhelmed by the messages of support they had received. Reports had suggested that Thursday's meeting of the Football Association of Wales council would include tentative talks over finding the man to fill the void left by Speed's death. Former Wales and Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has been linked with the role but Press Association Sport understands the council will not hold talks over finding a successor for Speed when they meet on Thursday, with the FAW considering any discussions of such a nature to be highly insensitive given that Speed's funeral has yet to take place. Any deliberations are set to be put on hold until at least the next council meeting in late December. Wales do not have a game until a planned friendly in February, against as yet unnamed opposition. Snapshots from Speed's time with Leeds, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton, Sheffield United and Wales. A stream of tributes have poured in from around the world in memory of the former Wales, Leeds, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton and Sheffield United midfielder. The FAW have opened a book of condolence at their headquarters in Cardiff while tributes have been left outside the grounds of Speed's former clubs. Earlier on Tuesday Welsh Assembly Members observed a minute's silence in the Senedd, Cardiff Bay, while flags continue to fly at half mast outside the Welsh Assembly buildings Ty Hywel and the Senedd. In Westminster, Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru MPs tabled a Commons motion offering the House's sympathies to Speed's wife and two sons, and demanding a \\"greater understanding of the pressures placed on those in the media spotlight and of mental health issues in general\\". FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford spoke on Monday of the organisation's desire to find a fitting tribute to the late Wales manager. It is understood one of the options is for the February friendly to be used as an opportunity to celebrate Speed's life and career. Costa Rica, the country against whom Speed won the first of his 85 caps in 1990, could potentially provide the opposition although a deal for the game is not thought to be close to being agreed at this time. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp was among the latest to pay a glowing tribute to Speed. He said: \\"I was with Gary a few weeks back - I managed a team in a charity game for (former Wales striker) John Hartson. He managed a Welsh team of ex-players and celebrities, I did an England team. \\"We had a great night at Derby and raised some money for John's charity. Gary played, looked like he could still play - he never stopped running around. He was like a 20-year-old. He was in such great condition and he was a great guy. \\"We talked about Wales, how well he'd got them playing. He got them playing so well.\\" Celtic manager Neil Lennon added his tribute to Speed, a regular opponent in Premier League competition during Lennon's time at Leicester. Lennon, who met Speed on a course recently, said on Celtic's official website, www.celticfc.net: \\"All the tributes coming his way are genuine. \\"He was a fantastic pro and a fantastic player. I sometimes think that gets overlooked because of the longevity he had in his career.\\" The Premier League on Tuesday confirmed that a minute's applause would be observed at all matches this weekend, in honour of Speed, who made 535 appearances in the competition. A minute's silence was called at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday for Swansea's clash with Aston Villa, which spontaneously became one of applause as fans from both sides began to clap.","completion":"A news article talks about an investigation into the death of Gary Speed, a famous soccer player and manager.

The term is derived from the Latin word \\"septem,\\" which means \\"seven,\\" and \\"annum,\\" meaning \\"year.\\" In various contexts, a septennium can be utilized to describe a specific time frame or to classify historical events based on a seven-year duration. For instance, scholarly fields may employ a septennium as a reference tool when tracking the progression of social, cultural, economic, or political developments over time. Additionally, some religious traditions assign particular significance to the number seven, and thus, a septennium could symbolize a significant period of spiritual growth or change. In certain legal or financial contexts, a septennium may serve as a guideline for planning purposes, as evidenced by the cyclical seven-year schedule employed by some economic systems or tax regulations. Overall, a septennium's importance varies depending on the specific context in which it is used. Yet, the common denominator is always the same: a septennium encompasses a period of seven years, highlighting the significance of this particular time frame in various disciplines and traditions."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

A:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google regarding the unique stripe patterns of baby zebras does not directly address the question about their size when born. To provide a detailed answer: Baby zebras, or foals, are usually born after a gestation period of about 12 to 13 months. At birth, a zebra foal weighs about 55 to 88 pounds (25 to 40 kilograms) and stands approximately 3 feet (90 centimeters) tall. They can stand up on their own and start walking within 15 minutes of being born. This immediate mobility is crucial for the survival of a baby zebra in the wild, as it enables them to swiftly flee from potential predators. The unique stripe patterns mentioned in your Google search result are indeed distinctive for each zebra, much like our own fingerprints. These patterns have multiple functions: they help in camouflage, temperature regulation, and even as a way for family members to recognize each other within a herd.

Q: Passage: Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.

The first question specifically asks about the existence of moderators that oversee Quora moderators, while the second question seeks a broader understanding of the overall Quora moderation system. To provide a comprehensive answer for both questions, I will first explain how Quora moderation works, and then address the existence of moderators moderating other Quora moderators. Quora, a platform for users to ask questions and share knowledge, relies on a combination of human moderators and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to maintain conversation quality. The moderation process can be broken down into several key elements: 1. Community Guidelines: Quora has established clear guidelines that participants are expected to follow. This includes prohibitions on spam, harassment, and hate speech, ensuring that answers remain relevant and respectful. 2. User Reports: Users can report inappropriate content or behavior directly through the platform. This helps the moderation team identify and address potential violations of community guidelines. 3. AI Algorithms: Quora leverages AI algorithms to detect and filter content that violates guidelines. These algorithms can analyze patterns and identify potential issues, such as spam or offensive language, even before a user reports them. 4. Human Moderators: Quora employs a team of moderators who review flagged content, make decisions on potential community guideline violations, and enforce penalties as needed. While AI algorithms play a vital role in content moderation, human judgement remains an essential component in ensuring that the system remains fair and accurate. 5. Appeals Process: Users who believe their content was unfairly flagged or removed can appeal the decision. This ensures that users' perspectives are heard and allows for adjustments in the moderation process if mistakes have been made. Now, to address the question of whether there are moderators moderating the Quora moderators, the answer is yes, but indirectly. Quora's moderation team, like any organization, is likely subject to hierarchical oversight and internal policies for quality assurance and accountability. Moderators' actions and decisions may undergo audits or reviews by higher-level staff members to ensure consistency, accuracy, and adherence to Quora's guidelines. In summary, the Quora moderation system relies on a combination of community guidelines, user reports, AI algorithms, and human moderators to maintain a high quality of conversation on the platform. Furthermore, the moderation team itself is likely subject to oversight and monitoring by higher-level staff members within the organization, ensuring that all moderation actions align with Quora's guidelines and objectives."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how an oil rig works Suggested answer: In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.

Write some highlights for the following article: PUBLISHED:. 04:36 EST, 15 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 05:55 EST, 15 January 2014. The 15-year-old child bride featured on controversial television programme Benefits Street has had a baby with her Romanian migrant 'husband', it has been revealed. The girl was seen on the Channel 4 series on Monday, where she was on screen alongside her husband, who gave his name only as Alex and described the marriage - illegal in both the UK and Romania - as 'alright, no problem'. It has now been revealed that months after documentary makers finished filming the series on James Turner Street in Birmingham, where 90 per cent of residents receive state handouts, the couple had their fist child. Child 'bride': A 20-year-old Romanian, right, boasted to cameras that his 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' Boast: 20-year-old Romanian Alex, right, boasted that having a 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' The baby girl was reportedly born in a hospital in the city, although the couple were thought to have temporarily left the UK for Romania to sign official papers relating to the three-month-old. The child's birth means the couple are now entitled to receive £88 every month in child benefit, as well as additional tax credits - although it is not known if they intend to claim them. Despite giving his name as Alex, the new father's family said his name was in fact Stefan Stana, while his partner, who was unnamed in the show, is Madalina Balasa, who is now 16. Mother: The girl, named by family members as Madalina Balasa, had the child in October after she turned 16. Unpleasant: Rubbish is piled on up James Turner Street, Birmingham. They featured on the series as part of a Romanian family, who did not claim benefits but worked as professional bin raiders, trying to scavenge for scrap metal to sell. Stefan's brother Florin confirmed the birth of the child, and said the couple, understood to still be living in Birmingham, had gone to Romania to get papers for the child. 'They have had a baby together,' Florin told The Sun. Ceremony: A wedding video shows the couple being 'married' - despite it being illegal in both the UK and Romania. 'It was born in October - she is called Miruna. Madalina was 16 when the baby was born.' Madalina was just 15 and a half when she and Stefan, then 20, were interviewed for the programme. He was seen boasting to the camera about his. child bride - aged just 15-and-a-half - and defending their union as. 'tradition' on the Channel 4 documentary series. The couple were shown talking about their 'marriage' in Monday's episode. Despite the girl being too young to. legally marry either in Romania or in the UK, her 'husband' said: 'This. scares people in England because she is a minor. 'In my country it’s. alright – no problem.' His wife was also asked if she loved him, replying 'Yes, I love him'. The couple were also seen showing off their wedding photograph, in which Stefan, dressed in a shiny black tuxedo and tie, holding his young bride's hand as she stands next to him in a white wedding dress and veil. Florin said that the couple had got married in Romania. Lib Dem MP John Hemming described child marriage as 'unacceptable' in the wake of the controversial programme. The episode showed Stefan and his family as the subject of a torrid of abuse from their neighbours, especially after the council stopped collecting rubbish after bin bags were torn open. One resident, known by her friends as 'White Dee', said: 'People move into a house and two days later they're rooting through your bin bags, that's not a nice thing and we don't want it on our road.' Another described the Romanians as 'little tramps'. Residents claimed that the situation with the rubbish was so bad, after no collections were made for two weeks, that rats were crawling through the streets. Controversial: The series has been attacked for its portrayal of claimants. The family of 14 had crammed into a small property, built for just four people, which they rented privately for £400 a month. In the programme they were shown rooting through bins looking for things to sell, heaping up disused appliances, pots and pans and old buggies. One family member admitted on the programme that neither her nor any other family members are legally entitled to work in the UK. Instead they make ends meet by collecting scrap - old cookers, microwaves, pots, pans and baby buggies - and selling it on to dealers. They claim to make only around £75 a week from this - barely enough to cover the rent on their home. Only George, a 12-year-old boy who goes to school, could speak English and communicate with their landlord or the neighbours. Notorious: James Turner Street is in the Winson Green area of Birmingham. They found the UK less attractive than they had hoped. At one point the father of the family said: 'In Romania life was much better. We had water, gas and electricity. We had our own house.', while another adds 'This is worse than Romania.' The family was eventually evicted after they couldn't keep up their rent payments, but were soon replaced by another group of Romanians - fourteen men who had come to England on the promise of farm labour, paid at £40 per day. The programme, which sparked outrage on social networks including Twitter focuses on the day-to-day lives of locals living in James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham. Ninety. per cent of residents living in the 137-house street claim one or more. benefits ranging from £500 to £900 a month in free hand-outs.

Question: One way animals usually respond to a sudden drop in temperature is by What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Choose from: [+] sweating; [+] shivering; [+] blinking; [+] salivating;","completion":"The correct answer to the question is: [+] shivering. When animals experience a sudden drop in temperature, their bodies react to maintain a constant internal temperature, also known as homeostasis. For many animals, the primary response to cold environments is shivering, which aids in generating heat by rapidly contracting and relaxing muscles. Shivering is an automatic and involuntary response that occurs when the body's core temperature decreases and the thermoregulatory system is triggered. The body goes through this process as a means to protect itself from the negative impacts of cold stress, such as hypothermia and frostbite. The other options presented do not appropriately reflect an animal's response to a sudden drop in temperature: [+] Sweating: This is a process by which animals release excess heat from their bodies through the evaporation of moisture from the skin or through specialized structures like sweat glands. Sweating is a response to elevated body temperatures, not a drop in temperature. [+] Blinking: Blinking is an action done with the eyelids, usually to clean and moisturize the eyes. It does not have a direct correlation with regulating body temperature nor responding to a sudden change in environmental temperature. [+] Salivating: This is the process of secreting saliva, a fluid produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. Saliva has several functions, including the digestion of carbohydrates, lubrication of the oral cavity, and maintaining oral hygiene. Salivation does not play a significant role in responding to a decrease in environmental temperature. In conclusion, shivering is the most accurate answer to the question of how animals typically respond to a sudden drop in temperature. It allows them to generate heat needed to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring their survival in cold environments."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Background: John Wood Campbell Jr. (June 8, 1910 - July 11, 1971) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He was editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. Context: Editor T. O'Conor Sloane lost Campbell's first manuscript that he accepted for Amazing Stories, entitled \\"Invaders of the Infinite\\". \\"When the Atoms Failed\\" appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade,. A complete novel in the series, \\"Islands of Space\\", was the cover story in the Spring 1931 Quarterly. During 1934-35 a serial novel, The Mightiest Machine, ran in Astounding Stories, edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in Thrilling Wonder Stories, edited by Mort Weisinger. The early work for Amazing established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to publish stories with a different tone he wrote as Don A. Stuart, a pseudonym derived from his wife's maiden name. From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names. Three significant stories published under the pseudonym are \\"Twilight\\" (Astounding, November 1934), \\"Night\\" (Astounding, October 1935), and \\"Who Goes There?\\" (Astounding, August 1938). \\"Who Goes There?\\", about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in Astounding almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as The Thing from Another World (1951), The Thing (1982), and again as The Thing (2011). Campbell held the amateur radio call sign W2ZGU, and wrote many articles on electronics and radio for a wide range of magazines. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \\"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\\" After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including \\"Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man\\"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought. Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov said of Campbell's influence on the field: \\"By his own example and by his instruction and by his undeviating and persisting insistence, he forced first Astounding and then all science fiction into his mold. He abandoned the earlier orientation of the field. He demolished the stock characters who had filled it; eradicated the penny dreadful plots; extirpated the Sunday-supplement science. In a phrase, he blotted out the purple of pulp. Instead, he demanded that science-fiction writers understand science and understand people, a hard requirement that many of the established writers of the 1930s could not meet. Campbell did not compromise because of that: those who could not meet his requirements could not sell to him, and the carnage was as great as it had been in Hollywood a decade before, while silent movies had given way to the talkies.\\" One example of the type of speculative but plausible science fiction that Campbell demanded from his writers is \\"Deadline\\", a short story by Cleve Cartmill that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell's successor as editor at Analog, wrote, it \\"described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.\\" The FBI descended on Campbell's office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine \\"the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons\\" and the demand was dropped. Campbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story \\"The Cold Equations\\". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had \\"three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted ... Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since the strength of this deservedly classic story lies in the fact that the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived.\\" Green wrote that Campbell \\"enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate.\\" As an example, he wrote, Campbell \\"pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others - and some Analog editorials I had read - that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks.\\" Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that \\"rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.\\" In a June 1961 editorial called \\"Civil War Centennial,\\" Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote, \\"It's my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done - and done right - half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist - if the lathes work well under his hands - the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.\\" According to Michael Moorcock, \\"He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\\" On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delaney's Nova a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he didn't feel his readership \\"would be able to relate to a black main character\\". There reputedly exists a letter from him to horror writer Dean Koontz in which Campbell argues that a technologically advanced black civilization would be a social and a biological impossibility. Question: What was Campbell's take on Slavery?. Whats the answer?","completion":"John W. Campbell had a controversial take on slavery. He believed that it provided some benefits to the enslaved African people brought to the American South, as it gave them a higher standard of living than they had in Africa. Campbell also argued that the increasing mechanization of the 19th century would have rendered slavery obsolete in a few more years without the need of the Civil War. Moreover, he implied that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy when freed and equated them to worker bees who die of misery when unable to work. While these opinions are seen as highly controversial and racist, it does show that Campbell's take on slavery was not straightforward and his views might have been shaped by a need to spark debate or provoke thought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person that Peter especially dislikes? is inside the article: Note: the story is told from the viewpoint of Corporal Robert Dunne. Tough-as-nails career Marine Sergeant John Stryker is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by PFC Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway, the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC Al Thomas, who blames him for his demotion. When Stryker leads his squad in the invasion of Tarawa, the men begin to appreciate his methods. Within the first couple of minutes of the battle, the platoon leader, Lt. Baker, is killed only seconds after he lands on the beach, PFC \\"Farmer\\" Soames is wounded in the leg, and PFC Choynski receives a head wound. The marines are aggressively pinned down by a pillbox. Able Company commander Captain Joyce takes charge and he begins to send out marines to silence the pillbox. As a result of three unsuccessful attempts to reach the pillbox, two demolition marines and a flamethrower operator are killed and PFC Shipley is left mortally wounded in the line of fire. Sgt. Stryker takes action and demolishes the pillbox. Shipley would eventually die of his wounds in front of his best friend Regazzi (Wally Cassell). Later on, Thomas becomes distracted from his mission, and \\"goofs off\\" when he goes to get ammunition for two comrades, stopping to savor a cup of coffee. As a result, though he brings back coffee for his squadmates, he returns too late — the two Marines, now out of ammunition, in the interim are shown being overrun; Hellenopolis is killed, Bass badly wounded., can you guess it ?

It is essential to address these feelings and evaluate various aspects before concluding that \\"It's just another worry on my mind that you are so occupied anyway.\\" 1. Empathy: Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to understand why they might be so busy. They could be dealing with work, family, personal, or financial pressures that require their full attention. By empathizing, you may develop a more comprehensive understanding of their situation and perhaps alleviate some of your concerns. 2. Communication: Open communication is critical in such situations. Discuss your feelings with the person and let them know that their constant busyness is adding to your worries. Allow them to explain their circumstances and work together to establish a better understanding of each other's needs and expectations. 3. Boundaries: To effectively manage your concerns and maintain a healthy relationship, it is essential to establish and respect each other's boundaries. This can involve setting aside specific times for uninterrupted communication or creating a system where both parties know what to expect concerning the other's availability. 4. Support: Offer support where possible, which can include practical help with tasks or providing emotional support by listening and understanding their situation. Sometimes, just knowing that someone cares and is willing to lend a hand can alleviate stress and make the situation more manageable for both parties. 5. Self-Care: While it's natural to worry about someone else's well-being, don't forget to take care of yourself as well. Make sure you invest time in your hobbies, interests, and nurturing your mental and emotional health, ensuring you have the resources to cope with any worries that arise due to the other person's busyness. In conclusion, while it is valid to feel that having a busy person in your life adds another worry to your mind, it is essential to approach the situation with empathy, open communication, respect for boundaries, and mutual support. Taking care of yourself is a vital aspect of managing your worries and maintaining healthy relationships. By considering all these factors, you can develop a better understanding of the situation, alleviate some of your concerns, and create a supportive environment for both parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Prepare the pan I would place the pan on the stovetop and turn on the heat to a medium setting. This ensures that the pan is preheated and ready for cooking. Step 3: Add oil to the pan Once the pan is heated, I would add the desired amount of oil (typically about 1-2 tablespoons) to the pan. This oil will serve as a lubricant to prevent the eggs from sticking to the pan while cooking. Step 4: Crack and beat the eggs While the oil is heating up in the pan, I would crack the desired number of eggs into the mixing bowl, being careful not to include any eggshell fragments. Using the whisk or a fork, I would beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are thoroughly combined. The beaten eggs will have a uniform color and consistency, promoting even cooking. Step 5: Mix the eggs and oil together Once the oil is hot and shimmering, I would carefully and slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pan with the oil, ensuring that the eggs are evenly spread out across the pan. Step 6: Cook the eggs Using the spatula, I would gently stir the eggs in the pan, allowing the oil and eggs to mix together. As the eggs cook, they will start to solidify. I would continue to gently stir the eggs to ensure an even distribution of oil throughout the cooking process. Step 7: Turn off the heat and serve Once the eggs have reached the desired level of doneness, I would turn off the heat and, using the spatula, transfer the cooked eggs from the pan to a serving plate.

The waters of the pool shining, shimmering in the sunlight. I was sitting on the steps of the pool, my legs submerged in water.Those blue depths were irrestisible. I inched a bit further in. Water to my waist… a little more…. closer to the blue…..just a little more…water to my chest… yes, keep going…a bit more…water to my neck….almost there….the blue gaze of those depths held me in awe…oh my..so beaut- — Going up a sort of endless escalator. I can't see very well what's in front of me. It's all very dark. I can sense someone behind me, but I dare not look back. For some reason I cannot see my feet. In fact, I cannot see any of me at all. It feels very strange and …well,creepy! I want to whistle, to kinda comfort myself, but it feels like I've lost the ability to speak. My mind just doesn't know how to carry out this desire to speak. It feels unnatural….. That someone behind me pokes me in my(invisible) back. Its'(his/her?) touch is strangely warm, then icy. I still don't look back….yes, that's the key, don't look back.

The situation they were in was quite disorienting and unusual, with the transition from a peaceful pool scene to an unsettling escalator experience and then suddenly back to the pool. Their senses were being bombarded with contrasting elements, making it difficult to comprehend what was happening. Additionally, they felt creeped out at various moments, unable to see their body and feeling an eerie presence behind them on the escalator. Their desire to whistle or speak for comfort was impossible to achieve, further adding to their confusion and discomfort. When they were snapped back to the pool with people screaming and a hand reaching out, it was another abrupt shift in the situation. Just as they were about to grasp the hand, the alarm sounded, jolting them out of this experience. Not knowing the outcome of what would have happened next would undoubtedly leave them feeling confused and somewhat disoriented. In summary, the rapid changes in the scenario, the mysterious and eerie escalator scene, the sudden return to the pool, and the intrusion of the alarm all contribute to the individual likely feeling confused when the alarm went off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He played as a member of the Washington Wizards in an NBA game vs. the Philadelphia 76ers. Jordan, often considered the greatest basketball player of all time, had an illustrious career that spanned over almost two decades. Born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Jordan attended E.A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, where he began his basketball journey. He then played college basketball for the University of North Carolina under the tutelage of Dean Smith. Known for his remarkable acumen and sheer talent, Jordan later joined the NBA in 1984 as the third overall pick for the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan's NBA career can be divided into three distinct phases: 1. First stint with the Chicago Bulls (1984-1993): Jordan played for the Chicago Bulls for almost a decade and led the league in scoring for 10 seasons. He catapulted the team to its first-ever NBA championship in 1991, eventually winning a \\"three-peat\\" with back-to-back championships in 1991, 1992, and 1993. 2. First retirement and brief stint in minor league baseball (1993-1995): In October 1993, Jordan shocked the world by announcing his first retirement from basketball. He declared his desire to pursue a career in professional baseball and signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox. After playing one season in the minor leagues, Jordan decided to return to basketball. 3. Second stint with the Chicago Bulls (1995-1998): Jordan rejoined the Chicago Bulls late in the 1994-95 season and led the team to another \\"three-peat\\" with NBA championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998. During this period, Jordan reestablished his dominance in the league and accomplished numerous records and milestones. 4. Second retirement and eventual return with the Washington Wizards (1998-2003): In January 1999, Jordan announced his second retirement from professional basketball. He later returned to the NBA as a part-owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. However, in September 2001, Jordan stepped down from his executive positions to make a comeback as a player. He played two seasons with the Washington Wizards (2001-2003) before finally retiring for the third and final time. Throughout his career, Jordan received numerous accolades including five NBA MVP Awards, ten All-NBA First Team selections, 14 NBA All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, ten scoring titles, and six NBA Finals MVP Awards, among many others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding I believe the correct choice is \\"crowding\\", here's why: A:","completion":"When visiting a museum that has narrow halls, the most prominent experience or effect is likely to be crowding. While other factors, such as sore feet, amazement, retrospection, and boredom, may play a role in one's visit to the museum, crowding is the most directly related answer to the question. First, let's examine how crowding can occur in a museum with narrow halls. When a museum is designed with narrow hallways or exhibition spaces, the limited space can cause people to congregate more closely together. This is especially true during peak museum attendance hours, such as weekends or special exhibitions. The narrow halls provide less space for individuals to explore displays and take in the artwork, thereby contributing to larger crowds forming in the confined areas. Now let's look at the other possible answers: 1. Sore feet: While standing or walking for extended periods may result in sore feet when visiting a museum, this issue is not necessarily unique to museums with narrow halls, and can occur in any museum or exhibition space. 2. Amazement: Experiencing amazement when visiting a museum usually depends on one's personal taste in art and the museum's specific exhibits, rather than the physical design of the building. One may feel amazement in a museum with wide halls, narrow halls, or even outdoor sculpture gardens. 3. Retrospection: Retrospection, or contemplating the past, may occur when viewing historical artifacts or works of art at a museum. However, like amazement, this experience is more related to the content of the museum and the individual's engagement with the exhibits rather than the specific design of the facility. 4. Boredom: Boredom, again, is a highly subjective experience that depends more on the individual's interest or connection with the museum's content than the design of the museum itself. In conclusion, the most suitable answer to the question \\"What happens when visiting a museum that has narrow halls?\\" is crowding. The restricted space created by the narrow halls causes visitors to cluster more closely together, leading to the experience of crowding, which differs from the other possible answers, as they are more related to the emotional and physical reactions that can take place in any museum or gallery, regardless of the architectural design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Apollo 18 Movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source. Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference,...

I have a new situation: Two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, are approximately 100 miles apart and are currently experiencing different weather. Appleton is windy and cloudy, but Orangeburg has very calm air but is also cloudy. But I can use this background: Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning. What is an answer for this question: Are the clouds in Appleton positively or negatively charged?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, we know that friction can cause objects like clouds to become charged. Wind can cause friction between clouds and the air, leading to a transfer of electrons. In your situation, Appleton has windy and cloudy weather. While friction is definitely playing a role in the charging of clouds in Appleton, it is challenging to definitively state if the clouds are positively or negatively charged. The charge depends on the specific materials involved in the friction process and the direction in which the electrons are transferred. Unfortunately, this information is not available in the provided scenario. However, a generic concept related to thunderstorm development could provide some insights. Usually, as a thunderstorm develops, the lower part of the cloud becomes negatively charged while the upper part becomes positively charged. This has to do with particle collisions and vertical air movements in the storm. Nonetheless, it is still important to note that without specific information on the types of cloud and the material involved in the friction process, it is impossible to conclude whether the clouds in Appleton are positively or negatively charged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he chats to her, he is found by his aides and bundled by to the Palace.Lord Percival hears of the reunion and offers Miranda a sum of money to contact the King again, agree to go on a date, and pose for some photographs that could be used against him.

She tells Lord Percival that the deal is off - but Percival manages to get some photographs of them together anyway.Ralph receives a call from Miranda that they shouldn't see each other anymore. Heart-broken, Ralph decides to look at the prospect of Princess Anne (Joely Richardson) from Finland as a future bride.

If no no in fact see TI actually sends uh test samples from time to time uh, can we conclude that \\"TI never sends us anything.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"TI never sends us anything\\" refers to the assumption that there is a complete absence of communication, material, or resources being exchanged between the two entities: TI and the receiver (in this case, \\"us\\"). From the information provided, it is understood that TI does send test samples occasionally. The assertion would be inaccurate if the intent is to convey that there is no interaction between the two entities. To understand the situation further, let's break down the scenario into key components: 1. Interaction between TI and the receiver (us): The context of this interaction is the exchange of test samples, which is an essential part of communication between businesses, organizations, or individuals. 2. Frequency of test samples sent by TI: It has been stated that TI sends test samples \\"from time to time.\\" This refers to an irregular or infrequent occurrence, yet it still shows that there is some interaction between the two entities. 3. The need for clarification: The statement, \\"TI never sends us anything,” projects an absolute conclusion and, if taken literally, it implies zero interaction. However, as there is evidence that TI sends test samples occasionally, this statement does not accurately represent the situation. A more accurate statement would be, \\"TI rarely sends us anything,\\" or \\"TI infrequently sends us test samples.\\" Moreover, the vagueness surrounding the frequency of these test samples can be further understood by looking into the factors that might influence their deployment. Here are a few possibilities: a. Business policies: TI might have a policy regarding the irregular sharing of test samples, depending on the changes to the products or services they offer or based on market demands. b. Schedule or events: TI might send test samples during specific internal or external events when they believe it is essential or beneficial to engage with their audience, customers, or partners. c. Resource constraints: TI may have limitations on their resources, leading to inconsistent availability to send out test samples. These constraints could be financial, logistical, or dependent on workforce availability. d. Changing priorities: TI might reallocate their resources or modify their business strategies, which could impact the regularity of the test samples being shared. In conclusion, it would be inappropriate to say that \\"TI never sends us anything\\" since there is evidence that TI does send test samples periodically. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe the situation as TI sending test samples infrequently or rarely. To gain a deeper understanding of the nature of this interaction, one should analyze the factors listed above and any other possible variables that could contribute to the irregularity of these exchanges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the side effects of eating momos?","completion":"While both of these questions ask about the side effects of eating certain types of food, they are inquiring about different items, and therefore do not have the same meaning. Let's explore each question in more detail. 1. What are the side effects of eating chocolate? Chocolate, which is made from cocoa beans, is a popular treat enjoyed by many around the world. It comes in various forms such as dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. The side effects of consuming chocolate can be both positive and negative. Positive side effects: - Mood enhancement: Chocolate contains compounds such as phenylethylamine, theobromine, and caffeine, which can stimulate the brain and improve mood. - Antioxidant properties: Dark chocolate, in particular, is rich in flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties that can help protect the body from cell damage caused by free radicals. - Improved heart health: Some research suggests that consuming moderate amounts of dark chocolate may be beneficial for heart health. It may lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Negative side effects: - Weight gain: Chocolate is high in calories and fat, which can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excessive amounts. - Tooth decay: The sugar content in chocolate can lead to tooth decay and cavities if proper dental hygiene is not maintained. - Migraine headaches: Some individuals may experience migraines due to the presence of certain compounds in chocolate. - Allergic reactions: Individuals with a cocoa or chocolate allergy may experience symptoms such as itching, hives, or difficulty breathing upon consumption of chocolate products. 2. What are the side effects of eating momos? Momos are a type of dumpling that originates from the Nepalese/Tibetan region and is popular in many parts of Asia. Typically filled with meat or vegetables, they can be steamed, fried, or boiled. The side effects of consuming momos can be positive or negative, depending on the individual's dietary needs, preferences, and potential allergies. Positive side effects: - Nutrient content: Momos filled with nutrient-rich vegetables and lean meats can contribute to a balanced diet and provide essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. - Healthy cooking methods: Steamed momos do not contain added oil or fat, making them a healthier alternative to fried food. - Taste and cultural experience: Momos offer a flavorful and unique culinary experience, introducing people to new flavors and textures. Negative side effects: - Consumption of unhealthy fillings: Some momo fillings may be high in fat and sodium, which can be detrimental to health when consumed frequently or in large quantities. - Food hygiene concerns: If momos are prepared in an unhygienic environment or with low-quality ingredients, it can lead to foodborne illnesses or side effects such as upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea. - Allergic reactions: Some ingredients used in momos, like wheat-based wrappers or specific fillings, may cause allergic reactions among individuals with food allergies. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about the side effects of consuming different foods, they are asking about two distinct items with their unique health benefits and potential drawbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is evident dissatisfaction with the food quality. The author details their disappointment by describing the quantity of the food wouldn't compensate for the poor quality, exemplified through the phrase \\"huge servings of terrible food didn't make up for the fact that it was still terrible food.\\" The repeated references to the food being \\"terrible\\" emphasize the strong negative sentiment held by the reviewer. Additionally, the author communicates dissatisfaction with the service by stating, \\"Service was terrible to boot.\\" This phrase expresses dissatisfaction with not only the primary element of their experience (food), but also with the complementary service. This adds to the overall negative sentiment as it indicates the poor service exacerbated the bad impression created by the unenjoyable food. The reviewer sets a tone of disappointment right from the start by beginning with \\"Good god - it's not that we sat down for brunch with HIGH expectations...\\" This phrase communicates that even without high expectations, their experience was incredibly unsatisfactory, underscoring the decidedly negative sentiment conveyed throughout the review.

Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The time period mentioned first in the given context is 1931.

Answer:","completion":"The song \\"Oh, I'm Going to Barbados\\" is alternatively known as \\"Barbados,\\" and it was originally performed by the British band Typically Tropical. The group, comprising of musicians Jeff Calvert and Max West, released the song as their debut single in the summer of 1975. \\"Barbados\\" was a commercial success for Typically Tropical, quickly rising through the charts and peaking at the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The song's catchy melody and tropical-inspired lyrics full of sun, sea, and sand evoked a sense of escapism, making it a popular hit during that period. The track narrates the story of a bus driver's dream of leaving his mundane routine behind, imagining his life in the beautiful island paradise of Barbados. The song features a mix of reggae, pop, and calypso influences, embodying the island's laid-back and sunny atmosphere. While Typically Tropical's original rendition of \\"Barbados\\" remains the most commonly associated version with the song, other artists have also covered it over the years. In 1983, the Vengaboys, a Dutch Eurodance group, released their own cover version titled \\"We're Going to Ibiza,\\" which adapted the lyrics and the setting but retained the original catchy melody. This adaptation became a popular hit in its own right, topping the charts in several countries, including the UK.

He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. In the 1986 American League Championship Series, Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The 1986 ALCS clincher was Clemens' first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later. After a bad start in Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, Clemens returned to the mound for Game 6, which would have clinched the World Series for the Boston Red Sox. Clemens left the game after 7 innings leading 3-2, but the Red Sox went on to lose the game in the 10th inning, and subsequently, the championship. Clemens' departure was highly debated and remains a bone of contention among the participants. Red Sox manager John McNamara claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that. Clemens greatest postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, when he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, accentuating the A's three-game sweep of the Red Sox. He was suspended for the first five games of the 1991 season and fined 10,000. Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept. Clemens' overall postseason record with Boston was 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings. How did he perform in game 6?","completion":"In Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Roger Clemens put forth a solid performance. He pitched for 7 innings and left the game with the Boston Red Sox leading 3-2. During his time on the mound, he helped keep the New York Mets' offense at bay, giving his team the chance to secure the championship. However, his performance was overshadowed by the Red Sox's eventual loss in the 10th inning, which further extended the World Series to a seventh game. Clemens' departure from the game was a point of contention between him and Red Sox manager John McNamara. McNamara claimed that Clemens removed himself from the game due to a blister, while Clemens strongly denied this assertion. Despite the controversy surrounding his exit, Clemens' performance in Game 6 showcased his pitching prowess and ability to perform under high-pressure situations. Unfortunately, his effort in Game 6 did not lead the Red Sox to clinch the championship, as they went on to lose the game and eventually the World Series to the Mets. However, Clemens' overall statistics and impact in the 1986 postseason contributed greatly to the Red Sox's ability to fight for the championship and ensured his status as one of the era's dominant pitchers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way. Which changes less frequently, term A or term B? Hint: Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is understood to be the weather of Earth. Answer:","completion":"In David's labeling system, term A represents weather, and term B represents climate. To understand which changes less frequently, let's examine the definitions of both terms and their differences. Term A (Weather): Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location. It includes a combination of elements like temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and air pressure. Weather can change rapidly, with alterations happening within minutes, hours, or days. Weather phenomena primarily occur in the troposphere, which is just below the stratosphere. Term B (Climate): Climate, on the other hand, is the long-term average of weather conditions in a particular region or across the planet. Climate considers the patterns and trends of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather elements over extended periods, usually measured in decades or even centuries. Therefore, climate represents a more stable, underlying pattern, which doesn't change as quickly as day-to-day weather conditions. Based on these definitions and explanations, it becomes evident that term B (Climate) changes less frequently than term A (Weather). The weather experiences rapid fluctuations, while climate represents a more consistent pattern over a longer timescale. Understanding this distinction is crucial in comprehending climate change issues and the impacts of human activities on Earth's atmosphere, ecosystems, and overall climate system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You can find over-the-counter acne preparations with lower doses of retinoids than you'll get from a prescription. However, many people respond to the over-the-counter strength products well and do not need prescriptions. Ask your doctor if you need a prescription or if over the counter is a better option for you. Women with bad acne have the option to use oral contraceptives to control their hormonal levels. This also has the advantage helping to balance other secondary effects of the hormones, such as irritability and water weight gain. You need a prescription to get contraceptives that affect your hormones. Don't use oral contraceptives if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Accutane is an anti-acne medication for treatment of severe acne and requires a prescription. If you have sebaceous gland hypertrophy or severe acne, ask your doctor if Accutane is right for you. You will need to have your blood monitored every month while taking the medication and may experience side effects for several months after using it. Do not use Accutane unless you fully understand the risks of the medication. Accutane can have long-term effects on your health and wellness. You cannot take Accutane if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Phototherapy is a treatment option you can perform at home by purchasing special equipment, or you can choose to ask your dermatologist. Research supports this treatment, which is simple and easy to perform. Technically, exposure to sunlight is phototherapy. However, in climates where the sun doesn't shine enough hours or you can't get outside when the sun is out, you can purchase a phototherapy unit. Use the unit to treat your acne as directed and using the safety precautions listed on the unit. Possible side effects from using these units include skin that becomes red, peels or changes skin tone. Your doctor may also perform photodynamic therapy in the office. This involves applying a medication to the skin, which is then activated by a special light. This is more effective than a light treatment alone. Oral and topical antibiotics may be used to treat acne, especially when reinfection is a concern. Topical antibiotics can be used long-term, usually along with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. Oral antibiotics are usually used short-term to get a bad breakout under control.

These non-prescription strength products often work well for many individuals, but a doctor's advice is recommended to decide if a prescription is necessary. For women with severe acne, oral contraceptives can be used to regulate hormonal levels. This not only addresses acne, but also helps balance other hormone-related issues, such as irritability and water weight gain. However, contraceptives must not be used by those who are pregnant or trying to conceive and require a prescription from a healthcare professional. Accutane is an anti-acne medication designed for severe acne treatment, which requires a prescription and close monitoring. Blood tests must be conducted monthly while on the medication, and side effects may persist for months after its use. Due to its potential long-term health effects, it is crucial to understand the risks associated with Accutane before using it. Accutane must not be taken by those who are pregnant or planning to conceive. Phototherapy, which can be conducted at home or by a dermatologist, is a treatment supported by research. Sunlight exposure itself is a form of phototherapy, but special equipment can be purchased for use in less sunny climates or indoor settings. Despite its simplicity, some side effects may arise, such as redness, peeling, or changes in skin tone. Photodynamic therapy administered by a doctor is more effective and involves applying medication to the skin activated by a specific light. Lastly, oral and topical antibiotics can be employed to treat acne, particularly in cases of inflammatory acne or risk of reinfection. Topical antibiotics can be used long-term alongside benzoyl peroxide or retinoids, whereas oral antibiotics are typically employed short-term for controlling acute breakouts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From which animal is the milk taken?","completion":"The \\"Caravane\\" cheese is produced in Mauritania, a country located in West Africa. This unique cheese is derived from the milk of a domesticated camel, specifically the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), which is native to the region. Camel milk has been an essential part of the diet of various nomadic and pastoral communities inhabiting the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia for thousands of years. The camel is exceptionally well-suited to the harsh climate conditions of these areas, as it can bear high temperatures, long periods of water scarcity, and travel vast distances with relatively low energy expenditure. Camel milk is more nutritious than cow milk and has a higher content of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, iron, calcium, and potassium. It also contains less cholesterol and saturated fat, making it a healthier alternative. Additionally, camel milk is known for its therapeutic properties, such as its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. The process of making traditional \\"Caravane\\" cheese is quite fascinating. First, the camel milk is left to ferment naturally for a day or two in a container made from either wood, leather, or plastic. Once the milk thickens and curdles, the curds are drained and the whey is separated. The curd is then molded into a distinctive round shape, usually wrapped in a palm leaf or another type of natural, biodegradable material that can be easily sourced from the region. Once the cheese is formed, it is left to ripen for a few days to up to two weeks, depending on the preferred level of firmness and flavor intensity. During the ripening process, the cheese develops its characteristic robust and slightly salty taste, with a creamy consistency that melts nicely in the mouth. \\"Caravane\\" camel cheese is consumed by the local population and is also gaining popularity in other parts of the world due to its nutritional content and unique flavor. This cheese can be enjoyed on its own, with traditional bread or served with fruits, nuts, or as a garnish for various savory dishes. In conclusion, \\"Caravane\\" is the brand name of a cheese produced in Mauritania, and it is made from the milk of dromedary camels. The camel milk provides a higher nutritional value compared to cow milk, which makes it an attractive choice for cheese production. Moreover, the traditional process of making Caravane cheese highlights the region's unique cultural practices, making it an interesting gastronomic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I heard that the flooding was bad.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"I heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad,\\" we are informed that there has been some rain and that it has been negatively affecting the area. However, the premise does not explicitly provide information about the exacerbation of the situation due to flooding. Thus, we need to examine whether this premise entails the hypothesis \\"I heard that the flooding was bad\\" or not. Entailment in this context refers to the logical relationship between the premise (information provided) and the hypothesis (supposition or assumption based on the premise). If the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also likely true. However, if the premise is not connected or not sufficient to support the hypothesis, then the entailment cannot be established. In our case, the premise is focused on the occurrence of rain and its negative impact on the area. Nonetheless, the emphasis is on rain rather than flooding. Flooding refers to a situation where an area gets inundated with water due to factors like an overflow of a water body, excessive rainfall, or poor water management. As a result, establishing an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis is difficult without more specific information about the actual damage caused by the rain. For example, it is possible that the rain has caused disruption to daily life, traffic jams, or infrastructure damage, but it may not necessarily involve flooding. The term \\"it's really been that bad\\" in the premise is vague and does not clarify the extent of the damage, nor does it mention the scale of the problem in terms of flooding. It could mean that the rain was severe and caused issues on its own without necessarily causing floods. Therefore, based on the premise, the entailment between the given information and the hypothesis, \\"I heard that the flooding was bad,\\" is inconclusive and cannot be established with certainty. It would require additional data or evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, reports on flood levels, infrastructure damage due to floods, or local warnings specifically concerning flood risks, to determine if the hypothesis is indeed accurate and corresponds with the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Emperor Zhang's (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Chris Greenwood. PUBLISHED:. 10:18 EST, 6 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:06 EST, 6 June 2013. Jailed: Philip Gaisford, 64, a former Scotland Yard chief superintendent, was found guilty of 27 offences against nine boys and girls. A retired top police officer who set up a scuba diving business so he could groom young boys for sex has been jailed for life. Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home. The former Scotland Yard chief superintendent enticed dozens of children with scuba lessons and pool parties. But he abused his trusted position to single out potential victims who he plied with sparkling wine as he enforced a ‘no trunks’ policy. The case raises worrying questions about how he was able to prey on young people for so long without being stopped. The pervert was arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused after Gaisford organised work experience for him at the Met. But the investigation was dropped, leaving Gaisford free to continue running his seedy scuba diving business for another decade. During that time hundreds of young people visited his home in Crowborough, East Sussex, for group lessons and private tuition. Lewes Crown Court heard how Gaisford was finally brought to justice after an acrimonious divorce from his wife Susan, 62. The couple moved to East Sussex after she twice caught him naked with young men at their previous home in Caterham, Surrey. She gave him a second chance but tipped off police about child abuse images on his computer when he admitted having sex with a 15-year-old boy. Officers arrested him and discovered a stash of handcuffs and flick knives which Gaisford had confiscated during his 30-year career with the Met. Suspicious detectives began contacting potential victims as they examined paperwork from the scuba business. Among them was the victim from the 2000 case. They discovered Gaisford was at the centre of a horrific web of abuse which took place around pools at both properties. Locked up: The former police officer retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record. He used the scuba diving business as a front to create opportunities when he could be alone with the most vulnerable young people and abuse them. Gaisford also attracted dozens of scouts by renting out a large field beside his sprawling rural property. Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said Gaisford encouraged his pupils – many of whom saw him as a ‘father figure’ – to remove their swimming trunks. He said Gaisford held ‘pool parties’ at which he molested boys and girls who ‘did not want to be touched in that way’ and nick-named him 'paedo-Phil'. He added: ‘He was able to manipulate these young people and persuade them and himself that there was nothing wrong with it.’ The court heard Gaisford organised scuba diving trips to Egypt during which he was ‘very touchy feely’ and set up reunion parties when they returned. Jurors were shown pictures of him in a pair of speedos drinking and encouraging young people to wax his chest hair off. Sex attacker: Gaisford encouraged his pupils 'many of whom saw him as a 'father figure' to remove their swimming trunks. In one image the words ‘insert here’ were written on Gaisford's back with an arrow pointing downwards, alongside a lewd drawing. In emotional evidence, one victim told the court he was raped and abused for three years after falling under Gaisford’s spell as a scout. The man said he was made to wear ‘tight swimming trunks’ which he was ordered to remove for a sauna after scuba lessons. He said the sexual abuse started with Gaisford ‘massaging’ him naked. It then progressed from naked swimming to kissing and sex. At one point Gaisford claimed to give him a ‘medical examination’ by inserting a finger into his body, which he said he was doing to check his prostate. The man, who was 16 at the time of the abuse, said: ‘I was scared of him telling my parents about all of it. Sex attacker: Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home. ‘I didn't know what he was capable of, although he was nice to me I have seen him be not so nice to other people.’ The victim finally went to police when he tried to cut off Gaisford and the former police officer threatened to tell his family about what had happened. Jailed: Gaisford was first arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused, but the investigation was dropped. Gaisford, who retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record, served in Soho and Mayfair. He then went on to work for another Government agency before being sacked in 2003 on his conviction for assaulting police officers after being caught drink driving. The pervert admitted to police that he had the ‘Gaisford curse’, meaning he had a high sex drive, which he found hard to ‘keep in check’. He blamed child abuse images on his computer, many of which had a ‘spanking’ theme, on being sent boarding school as a child. Gaisford, who has been in custody since August, was convicted of 27 sexual offences against nine victims – including four boys and two girls – between 1997 and 2008. His youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy. He was also convicted of raping an adult woman and 10 offences of possessing indecent videos of children. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years before he can apply for parole when he was jailed last Friday. Det Insp Rob Morland, of Sussex Police, said the former police officer was only brought to justice thanks to the courage of his victims. He said: ‘Gaisford systematically and cynically abused trusting young people who had become involved with him in his capacity as a scuba diving instructor and the court clearly found his conduct to be a gross breach of trust.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article tells the story of Philip Gaisford, a former top police officer, who got into trouble for doing very bad things to young boys and girls.

After many years, Philip was finally caught because his wife told the police about the bad things he had done. The police found out that he had hurt many children and had many bad pictures and videos on his computer. He was taken to court and found guilty of 27 bad things that he did to nine children, as well as hurting an adult woman.

To do that, we should divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*j) / -2 = 10 / -2 Since -2 divided by -2 is 1 (a negative divided by a negative is a positive), we get: 1*j = -5 And that's the same as: j = -5 There you go!

Given the question: Background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Paragraph: Gary and Joe are two farmers.

No. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does a gasoline lawn mower convert gasoline into?\\" is \\"minerals\\", given that a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into movement? Answer:","completion":"The options \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" provided do not give an appropriate response to the question at hand. Therefore, I would like to provide the relevant information as a detailed answer. A gasoline lawn mower operates on an internal combustion engine, which utilizes gasoline as its primary source of fuel. When the question asks whether a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into \\"minerals,\\" it is essential to understand the underlying processes and reactions that occur during the conversion of gasoline into movement. During the operation of the lawn mower, gasoline undergoes combustion within the engine. Combustion is a chemical reaction where a hydrocarbon (gasoline) reacts with oxygen to produce heat, light, and chemical byproducts. The significant byproducts of gasoline combustion are carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), and trace amounts of other gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). The heat and gas pressure generated during combustion push the engine's pistons, which, in turn, rotates a crankshaft that powers the lawn mower's wheels and blades, creating movement. When referring to \\"minerals,\\" it is crucial to recognize that these are naturally occurring inorganic substances with a specific crystalline structure, which may include substances such as metals, non-metals, or silicates. The process of converting gasoline into movement through combustion does not involve the creation or transformation of gasoline into minerals. Instead, combustion breaks down the chemical structure of gasoline (a hydrocarbon), facilitating its reaction with oxygen to release energy in the form of heat and gas pressure, which is then harnessed to enable movement. Consequently, the byproducts generated during this process are primarily gaseous substances like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other trace gases, not minerals. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Does a gasoline lawn mower convert gasoline into minerals?\\" is no. A gasoline lawn mower does not convert gasoline into minerals; rather, it converts gasoline into thermal energy, gas pressure, and gaseous byproducts through combustion, which is then utilized by the engine to create movement."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, your goal is to judge a correct answer to a given question based on an associated paragraph and decide if it is a good correct answer or not.

Choices: - sanctuary farm - cow pasture - countryside - cattle ranch - slaughterhouse The rationale to choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"slaughterhouse. Step 1: Understand the question The question asks where the farmer sent the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm. This implies that the location must be economically beneficial for the farmer. Step 2: Analyze the choices - Sanctuary farm: A place where animals are protected and taken care of. It is not a place where the farmer would make money. - Cow pasture: A place where cows graze. It doesn't indicate any means for the farmer to make money from the heifer. - Countryside: A general area for farmland and farming communities. It is not a specific location where the farmer would make money from the heifer. - Cattle ranch: A place where cattle are raised for various purposes, including dairy and meat production. It could be a potential option, but it doesn't guarantee that the heifer would make money for the farmer. - Slaughterhouse: A facility where animals are slaughtered for meat production and other by-products. This place would allow the farmer to make money by selling the heifer's meat and by-products. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the analysis, the slaughterhouse is the most appropriate choice because it is a place where the farmer would make money when the heifer is no longer useful to the farm.

Available options: -- You will get a bigger number from adding 2 numbers together -- You will get a smaller number from adding 2 numbers together","completion":"To determine which solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, we can perform a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Consider the nature of addition In the process of addition, you combine two or more numbers to obtain a single value. Step 2: Analyze the effect of adding positive numbers When adding two positive numbers, the sum will be greater than either of the individual numbers because they are both contributing to an increased total value. Step 3: Analyze the effect of combining positive and negative numbers When adding a positive number and a negative number, the sum can be smaller than the positive number, greater than the negative number, or equal to zero depending on the magnitudes of the numbers. In this scenario, the result depends on the specific numbers being added. Step 4: Analyze the effect of adding negative numbers When adding two negative numbers, the sum will be less than either of the individual numbers because they are both contributing to a decreased total value.

Question: Information: - JPEG XR (abbr. for JPEG extended range) is a still-image compression standard and file format for continuous tone photographic images, based on technology originally developed and patented by Microsoft under the name HD Photo (formerly Windows Media Photo). It supports both lossy and lossless compression, and is the preferred image format for Ecma-388 Open XML Paper Specification documents. - JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered MIME types are defined in RFC 3745. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is image/jp2. - Digital photography is a form of photography that uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film. The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, digital publishing or printing. - The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for telecommunications. - The Joint Photographic Experts Group is the joint committee between ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) that created the JPEG, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1) titled as \\"Coding of still pictures\\". In the ITU-T, its work falls in the domain of the ITU-T Visual Coding Experts Group (VCEG). ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29 Working Group 1 (working together with ITU-T Study Group 16 SG16 and previously also with Study Group 8 SG8) is responsible for the JPEG and JBIG standards. The scope of the organization includes the work of both the Joint Photographic Experts Group and Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group. - JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A digital image is a numeric representation of (normally binary) a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. By itself, the term \\"digital image\\" usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images. - A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a \\"brief oscillation\\" like one recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be combined, using a \\"reverse, shift, multiply and integrate\\" technique called convolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the unknown signal. - Lossless JPEG is a 1993 addition to JPEG standard by the Joint Photographic Experts Group to enable lossless compression . However , it might be used as an umbrella term to refer to all lossless compression schemes developed by the Joint Photographic Expert group . They include JPEG 2000 and JPEG - LS . Lossless JPEG was developed as a late addition to JPEG in 1993 , using a completely different technique from the lossy JPEG standard . It uses a predictive scheme based on the three nearest ( causal ) neighbors ( upper , left , and upper - left ) , and entropy coding is used on the prediction error . The standard Independent JPEG Group libraries can not encode or decode it , but Ken Murchison of Oceana Matrix Ltd. wrote a patch that extends the IJG library to handle Lossless JPEG . Lossless JPEG has some popularity in medical imaging , and is used in DNG and some digital cameras to compress raw images , but otherwise was never widely adopted . - Image quality is a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation (typically, compared to an ideal or perfect image). Imaging systems may introduce some amounts of distortion or artifacts in the signal, so the quality assessment is an important problem. - A filename extension is an identifier specified as a suffix to the name of a computer file. The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A file extension is typically delimited from the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces. - The objective of image compression is to reduce irrelevance and redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form. - In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storage, handling, and transmitting content. Different versions of the photo of the cat above show how higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed. This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless techniques. - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - The Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group (JBIG) is a group of experts nominated by national standards bodies and major companies to work to produce standards for bi-level image coding. The \\"joint\\" refers to its status as a committee working on both ISO and ITU-T standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1), whose official title is \\"Coding of still pictures\\". - JBIG is an early lossless image compression standard from the Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group, standardized as ISO/IEC standard 11544 and as ITU-T recommendation T.82 in March 1993. It is widely implemented in fax machines. Now that the newer bi-level image compression standard JBIG2 has been released, JBIG is also known as JBIG1. JBIG was designed for compression of binary images, particularly for faxes, but can also be used on other images. In most situations JBIG offers between a 20% and 50% increase in compression efficiency over the Fax Group 4 standard, and in some situations, it offers a 30-fold improvement. - Lossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though this usually improves compression rates (and therefore reduces file sizes). - A discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. DCTs are important to numerous applications in science and engineering, from lossy compression of audio (e.g. MP3) and images (e.g. JPEG) (where small high-frequency components can be discarded), to spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out (as described below) that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions. - Compress is a Unix shell compression program based on the LZW compression algorithm. Compared to more modern compression utilities such as gzip and bzip2, compress performs faster and with less memory usage, at the cost of a significantly lower compression ratio. What is the relationship between 'lossless jpeg' and 'file format'? Answer:","completion":"Lossless JPEG is a type of image compression standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) that enables lossless compression of images. It is an addition to the JPEG standard that uses a completely different technique from the lossy JPEG standard, where no information is lost during compression. Lossless JPEG compresses the image data without introducing any artifacts or degradation in image quality. On the other hand, a file format is a standardized way of organizing, storing, and encoding data in a computer file. It defines the structure and layout of the data and its metadata within the file. In the context of lossless JPEG, the file format refers to the specific structure and organization of the compressed image data. The relationship between lossless JPEG and file format lies in the fact that lossless JPEG is an image compression standard used to produce a compressed image file while maintaining its quality. This compressed image is then stored in a file format that adheres to the specifications of the lossless JPEG standard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The correct answer is the Ukrainian flag because the yellow and blue colors mentioned in the sentence correspond to the colors of the Ukrainian flag. The sentence is describing a situation where pro-Russian activists clashed with Ukrainian riot police in Donetsk, Ukraine, so it makes sense that an action against the Ukrainian flag represents the spreading unrest. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - CNN flag: This is a news organization, not a country, and it is not relevant to the situation in Ukraine. - Christine Lagarde flag: Christine Lagarde is a person, not a country, and she is not involved in the conflict. - Donetsk flag: Since Donetsk is a city in Ukraine, its flag would likely share colors with the Ukrainian flag, but the specific mention of yellow and blue makes the Ukrainian flag the more appropriate choice. - IMF flag: The International Monetary Fund is an unrelated organization to the conflict in Ukraine. - Russia flag: The colors of the Russian flag are white, blue, and red, not yellow and blue. - Russian flag: This has the same issue as the Russia flag; the colors do not match the description in the sentence. - Ukraine flag: This option is almost correct, but the flag should be referred to as the \\"Ukrainian flag.\\" - Ukrainian Interior Ministry flag: This would be a flag of a specific ministry in Ukraine, not the overarching Ukrainian flag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is married to Rachel? ? Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance. Young, married, in love and expecting their first child, they work as valet and maid for the elderly Jewish couple. They have everything to look forward to or so they would have believed.

For thousands of years, people have wondered about this big thing in the sky. Earth's moon is a satellite. A satellite is a body that orbits a planet. All moons are satellites, and many planets have them. Some have many moons. Earth, of course, only has one. It's a special moon, though. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system! In fact, the moon is much smaller than the sun. But it's much closer to Earth, so it looks as big as the sun. The moon is so close that you can see its dark and light spots without a telescope. Men flew and landed on the moon's surface many times by spacecrafts in the 1960s and 1970s. Neil Armstrong was the first human to step on the moon. He walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969. The flights to the moon have helped us learn much about it. Astronauts even brought rocks home with them! There's still a lot to learn about the moon. Now people still can't live on the moon because it does not have oxygen or water like the Earth. But I'm sure that humans can live there one day in the future. ,.

Help as much as you can. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. find the Classroom of list table for which Grade equals 5 ordered ascending by Classroom Output:","completion":"SELECT Classroom FROM list WHERE Grade = 5 ORDER BY Classroom ASC;"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Water expanding; IV. colder temperatures; V. mountain sources; VI. internal combustion; VII. decreased wind; VIII. Physical weathering; A:","completion":"Glaciers primarily melt via II. thermal conduction and VIII. physical weathering. II. Thermal conduction: When a cooler object (the glacier) comes into contact with a warmer object (for example, warmer air or ground temperature in lower elevations), thermal conduction occurs. The temperature difference between the colder glacier and its warmer surroundings causes heat to flow from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature until an equilibrium is reached. This transfer of heat energy results in the melting of the glacier. VIII. Physical weathering: Physical weathering refers to the processes by which rocks and other solid materials are broken down due to external factors such as temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and biological activity. In the case of a glacier, the surrounding rocks and sediment may expand and contract due to fluctuations in temperature. Over time, as these changes occur repeatedly, they cause the rocks and sediment to fracture and break, which can further contribute to the glacier's melting. When a glacier moves into warmer areas, the processes of thermal conduction and physical weathering act together to cause the ice to melt and sediments to be deposited on the surrounding landscape. While other factors such as vaporization (I), water expanding (III), colder temperatures (IV), mountain sources (V), internal combustion (VI), and decreased wind (VII) may play a role in the wider context of glacial processes, they are not the primary drivers of glacier melting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It remains the deadliest war in U.S. history, with an estimated loss of over 600,000 lives. So, a more suitable answer could be: \\"The Civil War was different from other wars because it was a conflict between regions within a single country, primarily focused on states' rights and the issue of slavery, and introduced various tactical and technological innovations.

Product review: Bright Greetings, In my humble opinion, there is no one book to encompass herbalism in its entirety...but if you are willing to combine two books may I suggest using this book in conjunction with Paul Beyerl's \\"A Compendium of Herbal Magick\\". Paul's book is full of information regarding Magick, history and lore...but contains no pictures. If you couple his book with the herbal guide Reader's Digest sells, you won't be disappointed. The RD book is loaded with both photos and drawings, and together they make a very informative team! May Your Path Be Blessed, Morgana Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. It suggests that although the book may not cover everything on its own, when combined with another book, it creates a highly informative and comprehensive resource.

Answer this question: which amendment to the us constitution is most concerned with probable cause??","completion":"The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is most concerned with probable cause. This amendment is a crucial aspect of the Bill of Rights and seeks to protect the privacy rights of citizens by placing specific requirements on law enforcement agencies for searching or seizing properties and individuals. It states: \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" Probable cause, in this context, means that a law enforcement officer must have reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been or is being committed, based on specific, factual evidence. This standard prevents officers from performing arbitrary searches and seizures by ensuring that there is an adequate basis for obtaining a warrant from a neutral and detached magistrate, who will evaluate the evidence presented to determine if probable cause exists. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment mandates that a warrant describes in detail the specific location to be searched and the persons or items that are the target of the search. This is designed to prevent general warrants, which would allow law enforcement to target individuals without any limitations on the scope of their actions. Over time, the courts have provided further guidance regarding the Fourth Amendment's protections. For instance, the Supreme Court established the exclusionary rule in the landmark Mapp v. Ohio (1961) case, which prohibits evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being used in criminal trials. Another famous case, Terry v. Ohio (1968), introduced the concept of \\"stop and frisk,\\" wherein law enforcement officers can briefly detain and search a person if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity, even if the suspicion falls short of probable cause. In conclusion, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution safeguards citizens' privacy rights by specifying that probable cause is necessary for law enforcement agents to conduct searches and seizures. By emphasizing the importance of having evidence-based reasons for believing that a criminal act occurred or is in progress, the amendment prevents the abuse of power and protects individuals from unreasonable intrusions by the state."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Nothing I can think of.

The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down.

Background: Renaissance are an English progressive rock band, best known for their 1978 UK top 10 hit \\"Northern Lights\\" and progressive rock classics like \\"Carpet of the Sun\\", \\"Mother Russia\\", and \\"Ashes Are Burning\\". They developed a unique sound, combining a female lead vocal with a fusion of classical, folk, rock, and jazz influences. Characteristic elements of the Renaissance sound are Annie Haslam's wide vocal range, prominent piano accompaniment, orchestral arrangements, vocal harmonies, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, synthesiser, and versatile drum work. The band created a significant following in the northeast United States in the 70s, and that region remains their strongest fan base. Context: As The Yardbirds were transforming into The New Yardbirds (with Jimmy Page) in 1968 and then Led Zeppelin, departing members Keith Relf and Jim McCarty formed an acoustic duo called Together. They released \\"Henry's Coming Home\\" b/w \\"Love Mum And Dad\\" as a single on Columbia Records in November 1968 without chart success. In January 1969, Relf and McCarty organised a new group devoted to experimentation with rock, folk, and classical forms. In his book Mountains come out of the sky: an illustrated history of prog rock, Will Romano quoted McCarty: This quintet -- Relf on guitar and vocals, McCarty on drums and vocals, plus bassist Louis Cennamo, pianist John Hawken, and Relf's sister Jane as an additional vocalist -- released a pair of albums on Elektra (US) and Island (UK-ILPS 9112), the first one, titled simply Renaissance, being produced by fellow ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith. The band had begun performing in May 1969, before recording had commenced for the debut LP, mostly in the UK, but with occasional forays abroad, including festivals in Belgium (Amougies, October 1969) and France (Operation 666 at the Olympia in January 1970, and Le Bourget in March 1970, both in Paris). In February 1970 they embarked on a North American tour, but that month-long trek proved only marginally successful. Because of their Yardbirds credentials, they found themselves paired with bands such as The Kinks and their new classically oriented direction did not always go down well because audiences were expecting rock/blues-based material. Beginning in the late spring of 1970 as touring began to grind on them, the original band gradually dissolved. Relf and McCarty decided to quit performing, and Cennamo joined Colosseum. Hawken organised a new line-up to fulfill contractual obligations to Island Records and complete the band's second album, Illusion which had been left unfinished. Question: Did they ever tour?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Renaissance did tour. In May 1969, the band began performing mostly in the UK, with occasional appearances in Belgium and France.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the quiz \\"What is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms\\" and \\"aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is oxygen. To understand why oxygen is the essential component for cellular respiration in organisms consuming volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols, it is important to first comprehend the role of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration and the characteristics of aerobic organisms. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by breaking down organic molecules, such as glucose, fatty acids, or amino acids. There are two main types of cellular respiration: anaerobic respiration, which occurs without the presence of oxygen, and aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen to function. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration, as it produces more ATP per molecule of substrate. Aerobic organisms, which include the majority of plants, animals, fungi, and protists, are organisms that use oxygen to carry out cellular respiration. These organisms have evolved to depend on the presence of oxygen for energy production, as it enables them to efficiently break down organic molecules for energy. When aerobic organisms consume volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols as energy sources, they still require oxygen to metabolize these substrates. VOAs, such as acetate and propionate, are converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle). Alcohols, such as ethanol, are first converted to acetaldehyde and then to acetate by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, respectively, before entering the citric acid cycle as acetyl-CoA as well. The citric acid cycle, which is a central component of aerobic cellular respiration, relies on the presence of oxygen. When acetyl-CoA produced from VOAs and alcohols enters the citric acid cycle, high-energy electrons are transferred to carrier molecules, such as NAD+ and FAD, to form NADH and FADH2, respectively. These electron carriers subsequently donate their high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the final electron acceptor is molecular oxygen (O2). Oxygen accepts these high-energy electrons, allowing the transport chain to pump protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. As a result, oxygen is essential for the completion of aerobic cellular respiration and the efficient generation of ATP. Based on the provided hints that \\"oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms\\" and \\"aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols,\\" it can be concluded that oxygen is the best answer to the question. Oxygen is the key component required for cellular respiration when organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, as these substrates ultimately participate in the oxygen-dependent process of aerobic cellular respiration in order to generate energy in the form of ATP."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My friends and I went to see the Gin Blossoms in 1993 at a small venue in Chicago. We were having some beers and enjoying the opening band (they were okay, but not memorable) when this guy came and stood right in front of my roommate. I mean, the floor was filling up, sure, but we’d landed a decent spot right in the middle and he came and stood right in front of her when there was plenty of room off to the side a bit. My roommate and our friend and I looked at each other and were like, “How rude!” Frankly, I was surprised my roommate didn’t do or say anything - holding her tongue wasn’t her forte. I half expected her to spank his bottom - I’d seen her do it before to get some guy’s attention, and this guy was pretty cute. But when that same song came to an end, the guy turned around and actually apologized to all of us. He held up his camera and said he wanted a really good shot of the band as they were friends of his. He actually went and bought each of us a beer, so it totally worked out well. We thanked him and he took off. The only excuse I have for us is that we were in college and not glued to MTV or entertainment magazines, and really, only Hey Jealousy had hit the airwaves when we went to the concert. But sure enough, when the Gin Blossoms took the stage, Robin Wilson gave a shout out to those three girls he’d blocked the stage for earlier and hoped we’d enjoyed our beers.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement? André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period. Answer:","completion":"The original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement is Kertész Andor.

Background: The Jay Leno Show is an American talk show created by and starring Jay Leno. Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. Context: Leno did not expect his show to beat competing first-run episodes, but to do better than reruns, in part because topical jokes benefit from the \\"immediacy\\" of the time slot versus 11:30 pm. A television analyst predicted that Leno would finish in \\"a safe third place\\" every night. NBC research before the show's debut indicated that fans of Leno would watch Leno two to three times a week. NBC saw a 1.5 rating for the show in the 18-49 demographic as \\"viable\\" and a 1.8 as a \\"home run\\". NBC told Leno that at a 1.5 rating, NBC makes 300 million a year. Tonight at 11:30 pm earned about a 1.3 to 1.5; the television audience at 10 pm is 40% larger than at 11:30 pm, and the network hoped Leno's audience would also grow. Industry observers have cited a range of ratings, from 1.7 to 2, as being necessary for the show to succeed at 10 pm. By comparison, 2.5 is generally necessary for a 10 pm drama to succeed; those that earned a 1.7 or less during the 2008-2009 season were generally cancelled. NBC's prime-time dramas averaged about 2 during 2008-2009. The first episode of The Jay Leno Show earned \\"fast national\\" estimates of 17.7 million viewers, an 11 Nielsen rating (5.1 among persons 18-49) and an 18 share, significantly above both his Tonight finale and the debut of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in all categories. By the second week and competing against season premieres, the audience fell to six million viewers, still on par with or exceeding NBC projections. As of November 1, 2009, The Jay Leno Show has averaged a 1.98 in the adults 18-49 ratings and 6.594 million viewers. During the week before Christmas, the ratings dropped to 1.4 during the week. Prior to the controversy regarding the move of the Jay Leno Show to 11:35 p.m., viewership bottomed out at 4.799 million viewers, although there was a slight bump as word of the controversy broke. Though the show had been meeting the network's projections for the show itself, it has been severely detrimental to the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates. Several stations across the country have seen what is known as the \\"Leno Effect\\", where the lower audience for Leno (as compared to NBC's scripted prime time offerings) translated directly into a domino effect of severe audience drops for late local news (on the order of 25-30%), effects that NBC had underestimated. Question: Did the ratings stay this way?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In order to provide an accurate response to the user's question about the ratings of The Jay Leno Show, I would have to gather more recent data or additional information beyond the provided context. The context only details the show's ratings up until November 2009 and mentions a controversy regarding a move to 11:35 p.m., but it doesn't specify the outcome or any subsequent changes in the ratings. Here's a step-by-step rundown of the task: 1. Identify the question: The query is about the ratings of The Jay Leno Show. Did they maintain the same level as reported in the context, which goes up until November 2009? 2. Analyze the context: The context provides detailed information about the ratings until November 2009. It mentions a decline in ratings and also a controversy surrounding a schedule change. However, it doesn't provide any information about the show's ratings beyond this point. 3. Identify information gap: The context doesn't provide information about the ratings following the controversy and beyond November 2009. 4. Formulate response based on analysis and information gap: Given the available context, I cannot definitively answer whether the ratings remained the same after November 2009 without more recent or additional information. So, I'd respond to the user: \\"Based on the provided context, the ratings information for The Jay Leno Show is only available up until November 2009, which mentions a ratings decline. There is also mention of a controversy about a change in schedule, but the context doesn't provide details about the outcome of this or how the ratings were affected afterward. To find out whether the ratings stayed the same, we would need more recent or additional information beyond what's provided in the context\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With its easy setup, user-friendly interface, reliability, and independent functionality, this app deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: The population of what had increased by 40% in 1901? The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

Yet this is just the tip of an iceberg when it comes to UK firms owned by Indian businesses. The visit to the UK by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which starts on Thursday, comes at a time when India is emerging as perhaps the strongest player among the so-called Bric nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China. While the Brazilian, Chinese and Russian economies are all showing signs of slowing, India is booming. Shielded from China's slowdown thanks to its huge domestic market, India's economy is growing at a rate of 7% per year, putting it neck and neck with the Chinese. And some of that Indian growth is finding new markets in the UK. According to a report earlier this year from government department UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK. In 2014 alone, investment from India into the UK increased by 64%, and is now almost level with France, the UK's second-largest investor after the US. Throughout last year, India invested in 122 projects in the UK, compared with 124 for France and 564 for the US. This meant that Indian investment created 7,730 new UK jobs in 2014, and safeguarded a further 1,620, said UKTI. Meanwhile, the UK India Business Council, the non-profit body that aims to boost trade and business links between the two countries, estimates that the total value of Indian investment in the UK in the 2013 to 2014 financial year totalled £1.89bn. Overall there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people. In addition to Tata Motors, Indian IT firms Infosys and Wipro have UK operations. Meanwhile, sister Tata business, Tata Global Beverages, owns best-selling Tetley Tea; and Tata Steel has significant UK operations, despite recently announced job cuts due to falling demand and cheaper steel from China. Alpesh Patel, of London-based private equity business Praefinium Partners, says that while the success of companies such as Tata and Infosys is well known, the quality of Indian small to medium-sized enterprises has improved significantly over the past 10 years, and many are looking to enter EU markets using the UK as their gateway. He adds that the ease of doing business in the UK, as well as the English language and familiarity with UK institutions, also makes the UK an attractive proposition for Indian investors. \\"Ease of business here is often overlooked and taken for granted,\\" says Mr Patel. \\"We're used to comparing things in absolute terms - we might say it took ages to fill in a tax return for example - but we don't compare it with the same thing in India where it really is a pain.\\" He adds that one area that particularly appeals to Indian investors is the ease with which they can raise finance in the UK. \\"They're often not looking for money from the UK to go into their company in India, but looking for UK money going into their UK operations. We really overlook the size and strength of our angel investor and venture capital community. \\"Relative to companies in India, we're seen as an absolute haven in terms of access to capital if you've got a good business.\\" Mukesh Rajani, UK India business group leader at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that besides the EU, the UK's historical connections with the rest of the world, including Africa, are key in attracting Indian investment. He adds that Indian firms are also keen to tap into British hi-tech expertise. \\"Advanced engineering is a big strength for the UK,\\" says Mr Rajani. \\"High-end engineering, high-end advanced services, high-end pharmaceuticals are very interesting areas for Indian companies. \\"Clearly at the high-end what is on offer in Britain is in a different league, and these things would take time for India to develop as it acquires its own talent.\\" Richard Heald, chief executive at the UK India Business Council, says that most of the investment in the UK is in the IT sectors and driven by Mr Modi's policy of making India the world's hub for IT industries. He says: \\"A lot of the growth in indigenous Indian industries has to be sustained through technological development. \\"If Modi's policies are to succeed then it needs to have exposure and involvement with a lot of the technological development, incubation, catapult centres, upstream technology companies that we have here. \\"The Indians naturally look to us for that in the form of joint ventures, or acquisitions, or just investment.\\" Mr Heald highlights pharmaceutical firms Piramal and Cipla as two other Indian businesses that have made significant moves into the UK. 110,000 people are employed by Indian companies operating in the UK 13 Indian companies each employ more than 1,000 people in the UK 65,000 people work for Tata Group, which owns 5 of those 13 companies 28,000 of those work for Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover But what about UK investment going into India? Between 2000 and 2015, the UK invested 22.2bn (£14.5bn) in India, accounting for around 9% of foreign direct investment in the country, according to a report by UK business group the CBI. This makes the UK the largest foreign investor in India after Singapore and Mauritius. The CBI study added that in total UK companies are estimated to employ 691,000 people in India. That is 5.5% of the organised private sector workforce. Mr Heald says: \\"We estimate that there's been a 300% increase in the number of British companies setting up there in the past 10 years… there's been a huge acceleration. \\"And the type of company is changing too - it's more e-commerce, services, IT and education.\\" Under India's federal system, individual states are now more competitive, and are seeking inbound investment by cutting red tape, and simplifying the country's notoriously arcane state tax systems. Mr Heald adds: \\"The term 'competitive federalism' is now being bandied around… these states really have to compete for the investment pound.\\" Summary:","completion":"India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK, with over 800 Indian-owned businesses - such as Tata Motors, Infosys and Wipro - in the UK employing more than 110,000 people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Grand Central Market on Broadway is in Downtown L.A. 2. The market is the oldest and largest open-air produce market. However, the second sentence states: 1. The product market on Broadway usually has rotten food. To determine the truthfulness of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's go step by step: Step 1: Identify if both sentences are talking about the same market. - Both sentences refer to a market on Broadway. The first sentence specifies that it's the Grand Central Market, which suggests they may be talking about the same market. Step 2: Analyze the information given in Sentence 1 and determine if it affects the truth of Sentence 2. - Sentence 1 tells us the age and size of the market but does not provide any information about the quality of the produce or food sold there. Step 3: Review if the information provided is enough to accept or reject the claim in Sentence 2. - Even though both sentences refer to a market on Broadway, without explicit information about the quality of the food sold at the market, we cannot determine if Sentence 2 is true based solely on the information provided in Sentence 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 34297*t = 17243*t + 17326*t - 16592 for t.. What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step like we are talking to a five-year-old. Imagine you have a giant box of candies. Now, let's say 34297 candies in the box are all for you (t). On the other side, we have two more boxes. First box has 17243 candies, and the second box has 17326 candies. In both of these boxes, candies are also for you (t). But from these boxes, you had to give away 16592 candies. To find the answer (t), we'll first put the candies from the two boxes together. So, first let's add 17243 candies (first box) and 17326 candies (second box). 17243 * t + 17326 * t = (17243 + 17326) * t = 34569 * t Now we have 34569 candies for you in one box. But remember we need to subtract the 16592 candies we gave away. So, let's see the remaining candies for you now: 34569 * t - 16592 So, to find how many candies you actually get, we need to make both sides of the equation equal. So it will look like this: 34297 * t = 34569 * t - 16592 Now, we will solve the equation by following these 3 steps: 1. Move 34297 * t to the other side, so we only have the 16592 on the left side 2. Find the difference between 34569 * t and 34297 * t 3. Divide the result by the difference Let's solve it step by step: 1. 34569 * t - 34297 * t = 16592 2. (34569 - 34297) * t = 16592 (272) * t = 16592 3. Now, we divide 16592 by 272 to find how many candies you get (t): t = 16592 / 272 t = 61 So, you'll get 61 candies (the answer for t = 61).

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Every day on the road, accidents are caused. They do not only happen. The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work. Question: The passage suggests that _ . Options: A: accidents mostly result from slippery roads B: accidents are usually caused by psychological factors C: doctors run three times the normal risk of accidents in factories D: about 50,000 people lost their lives at work in Britain every day The answer is:","completion":"B: accidents are usually caused by psychological factors The passage discusses various causes for accidents, including factors that are easy to see, such as an overloaded tray or a patch of ice on the road. However, it also highlights that more often than not, there is a chain of events leading up to accidents which involve factors such as frustration, tiredness, or bad temper. The article further states that road accidents frequently occur after a family quarrel and that some people seem to cause accidents for themselves and others due to their internal conflict and discord with the world. The passage also emphasizes that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness, suggesting that majority of road accidents are not caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers. This refutes option A, which claims that accidents mostly result from slippery roads. In the context of workplace accidents, the article mentions that despite safety regulations and committees, a significant number of employees are absent from work due to accidents. It points out that human error or misjudgment, often influenced by factors such as noise, fatigue, boredom, or worry, are the primary causes. Moreover, it states that individuals with high anxiety levels who consume alcohol are three times more likely to experience accidents at work. These points further support the idea that psychological factors play a significant role in causing accidents. Option C, which suggests that doctors run three times the normal risk of accidents in factories, is not accurate, as the passage states that people with high anxiety who drink too much are the ones more prone to accidents. Additionally, option D is not supported by the passage, as it refers to 50,000 men and women being absent from work due to accidents daily in Britain, not losing their lives. In conclusion, the passage suggests that accidents are usually caused by psychological factors, making option B the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence?, what is it ?

Supporters of its bid for World Heritage Status have described it as a masterpiece of human creative genius. Unesco appeared to agree with that assessment in its inspection report, which stated: \\"This enormous structure, with its distinctive industrial aesthetic and striking red colour, was conceived and built using advanced civil engineering design principles and construction methods. \\"Innovative in design, materials, and scale, the Forth Bridge is an extraordinary and impressive milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel.\\" World Heritage Sites are those which Unesco considers to have an internationally significant cultural or natural heritage, and whose value is considered to transcend national boundaries. The aim is to protect and preserve them for future generations. There are currently 1,007 World Heritage Sites spread across 161 countries.

The Steelers would come into the game riding a five-game losing streak. They also no longer controlled their playoff destiny, needing to win their final three games of the season, and also losses by other AFC teams to have a chance for a wild card. Pittsburgh would strike on their first play of the game when Ben Roethlisberger hit a wide-open Mike Wallace for a 60-yard TD pass.

In the 2nd quarter, QB Aaron Rodgers was able to scramble out of the pocket for a 14-yard TD run. Ben Roethlisberger would hit Mewelde Moore for a 10-yard TD pass in the final seconds of the 1st Half and the Steelers would take a 21-14 lead into halftime with them.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. gentamicin belongs to which class of antibacterial agents??","completion":"Gentamicin belongs to the class of antibacterial agents known as Aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are a group of bactericidal antibiotics that work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, leading to the death of susceptible bacteria. They are particularly effective against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species. Aminoglycosides share several common structural features, including a central aminocyclitol ring (typically consisting of a six-membered ring) linked to other aminosugars through glycosidic bonds. These aminosugars are essential for the antibiotic action, as they interact with the target ribosomes in bacteria. Gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, is produced by various species of soil-dwelling, Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces and Micromonospora genera. Gentamicin is derived from the Micromonospora genus, specifically, Micromonospora purpurea. The mode of action for gentamicin and other aminoglycosides involves binding to the bacterial 16S rRNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding causes misreading of the genetic code during translation, leading to the production of nonfunctional or toxic proteins within the bacterial cell. In addition, aminoglycosides interfere with the proper formation of the ribosomal initiation complex, also hampering protein synthesis. These two actions come together to disrupt the bacterial protein synthesis process and ultimately lead to bacterial cell death. Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, display concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, which means that the more significant the exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics, the greater the efficacy. They are also characterized by a post-antibiotic effect, wherein the bactericidal activity persists even after the antibiotic concentration drops below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). It is important to note that gentamicin and other aminoglycosides may have nephrotoxic and ototoxic side effects, making them less desirable options compared to less toxic antibiotics when available. However, their broad-spectrum activities make them valuable tools in the treatment of severe infections, particularly before the pathogen has been identified, or when there is a concern about the possible presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. They are often used together with other antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, to provide synergistic action and broaden the antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive slime mold-like substance (the Blob) that attaches itself to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being devoured by the growing Blob. While she tries to free him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, and the Blob oozes out of the hospital as Paul attempts to scream in pain while dissolving inside the Blob one last time. After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian is incredibly skeptical of Meg's story. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman, George, is pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob suddenly retreats after entering the freezer.

The breastfeeding nipple shield was designed initially for an infant who is having difficulties in latching, or the act of grasping and sucking the mother's nipples and lower areola area. It is important that the baby latches on to achieve maximum breastfeeding potential without friction or other complications. The breastfeeding nipple shield is can also be used if you have flat or inverted nipples. These sort of nipples make it very challenging for a baby to latch on. The shield also provides protection to the infant in case you have a skin diseases such as psoriasis or eczema, especially in the latching area. Using a nipple shield can help prevent the transfer of any of the aforementioned skin diseases from the mother to the infant. Some professionals believe that you should not use a nipple shield if you are not experiencing any of the problems listed above. They hold that the nipple shield will allow your child to get used to a firm nipple which may cause the infant to become confused when you try to feed him with your real nipple.

Summarize this article: He came from simple beginnings as the son of a sharecropper in North Carolina to achieve world-wide fame. And on Monday morning, the life of the humble and reserved Joe Frazier was remembered with elegance and passion in a two-hour ceremony at North Philadelphia's Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. Mr. Frazier, who moved to Philadelphia as a teenager, died Monday of liver cancer. He was 67. Longterm adversary Muhammad Ali paid his respect to the former heavyweight champion, along with fellow boxers Bernard Hopkins, Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks, among other. Ali was in visibly poor shape, clearly stricken from Parkinson's disease. Mr. Frazier's white casket was placed in front of the alter draped in a tapestry and adorned by various bouquets of flowers. The heavyweight tile belt he won by defeating Ali in 1971's \\"Fight of the Century\\" sat atop the casket. A 100-member choir sang hymns, while the preachers urged the crowd to rise from their seats and create an energetic scene. The Rev. Jesse Jackson addressed the bi-level gathering along with other religious leaders from Philadelphia. The Rev. Al Sharpton was scheduled to speak as well but cancelled Monday morning. The 46-year-old Hopkins remembered Mr. Frazier as someone who was not only a fighter but a vibrant member of the community. He said the courage Mr. Frazier displayed out of the ring served as an example for his own career. \\"If you can take a page out of Joe Frazier's book, to get knocked down and get back up,\\" said Hopkins. \\"Be true to what you believe in and what you do no matter what you do. . . . There are going to be challenges, and sometimes they look too big to defeat. But if you're Joe Frazier, you're going to put 100 percent in there.\\" Hopkins said Mr. Frazier never lost his will and determination to be a leader, fighting for causes that Hopkins said weren't always popular or noteworthy. \\"When I be remembered, I want to be remembered of what Joe Frazier had done,\\" said Hopkins. \\"If I can do one third of what Joe Frazier has done, then it's only a blueprint for me to leave a legacy.\\" In his remarks, Jackson chastised the city for not having a statue of Mr. Frazier. He questioned why the city so eagerly celebrated fictional boxer Rocky Balboa and not Mr. Frazier. \\"Tell them Rocky was not a champion. Joe Frazier was,\\" said Jackson. \\"Tell them Rocky's fist were frozen in stone. Joe's fists were smokin'.\\" Jackson incited a large cheer from the crowd as he demanded a statue of Mr. Frazier to be erected in Philadelphia. On Friday, Mayor Nutter said the city was in discussions with the family plans for a lasting memorial. Don King, who promoted Mr. Frazier's \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" bout with Ali, adorned his three piece suit with an American flag scarf and waived his signature American flag. He said that the promoting Mr. Frazier \\"was a thrill because he was the embodiment of a heavyweight champion.\\" King said that Mr. Frazier's reserved nature often made him misunderstood. \\"He was really fighting for freedom, justice and inequality the same as Ali was doing,\\" said King. \\"Only he couldn't articulate it as well as Ali. Therefore, he would use it in a competitive style with the courage and invincible spirit.\\" King said Monday's ceremony was a day of rejoicing as Mr. Frazier lived a good life and was able to fight for what he believed in. \\"He thought his way was better than Ali's way because his way was more moderate,\\" said King. King said Ali's repeated verbal jabs at Mr. Frazier stayed with Mr. Frazier for a long time. The promoter said he would have to mediate between the two as Ali ridiculed Mr. Frazier with racial insults. Holmes echoed those statements but said Mr. Frazier never showed the way he truly felt. He said Ali's insults hurt him more than anyone, but Mr. Frazier never talked about it. \\"But, I will,\\" said Holmes.

Movie plot title: Halloween III: Season of the Witch Movie plot: In northern California, on the night of Saturday, October 23, we see a man running down a semi-rural road as the movie opens. Obviously being pursued, the man Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs into a junkyard to try to hide or find help. Then we see his pursuers coming down the road in a car and enter the junkyard. The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from Stonehenge in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power. Just then, the man from the junkyard bursts into the gas station, clutching a Silver Shamrock Halloween mask, begging for help. The attendant, clearly disturbed, takes the man to the hospital.Meanwhile, not too far away, the recently divorced Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) stops off at home to see his ex-wife Linda (Nancy Kyes) and their two children.

In contrast, the other options mentioned (wasteland, ocean, desert, and flowers) do not make sense in this context and do not hold strong connections with urban development processes. The construction of a parking lot after the demolition of a community garden indicates a shift in priorities toward accommodating vehicles and providing parking spaces for commercial or residential purposes.

Also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening.

Twenty years later, on October 28, 2013, the school attempts to put on a new performance of \\"The Gallows.\\" Reese Houser is excited, as this gives him a chance to grow closer to his crush Pfeifer Ross. His friend Ryan Shoos is dismissive of the play, and comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. Reese is reluctant to take part, but agrees when Ryan promises that he'll be able to console Pfeifer afterwards, giving them a chance to kiss. Later that night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school, only to run into Pfeifer, who saw Reese's car. Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school, which angers Pfeifer. As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They also discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated when Reese runs off with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and what looks like a body hanging from above.

Which soft drink, described as having a unique flavour, was first nationally marketed in the USA in 1904 and has had many advertising slogans including 'what's the worst that can happen' in 2008?","completion":"The soft drink you are referring to is Dr Pepper. Dr Pepper is a popular carbonated soft drink that originated in the United States and was first nationally marketed in 1904. With a unique flavor that sets it apart from other soft drinks, it has remained a popular choice amongst consumers throughout the years. Dr Pepper's creation is attributed to Charles Alderton, a pharmacist working at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas. He combined a unique mix of fruit and spice flavors to develop the original syrup, which was then named Dr Pepper by the drugstore's owner, Wade Morrison. The drink quickly gained popularity and began to be sold across the United States starting in 1904. Throughout its history, Dr Pepper has had numerous advertising slogans to promote its distinctive taste. One of the memorable slogans came in 2008 with the tagline, \\"What's the worst that can happen?\\" This particular campaign was designed to encourage consumers to take a chance and try the unique soft drink, emphasizing that they might find they enjoy the taste more than they expect. Other notable advertising slogans for Dr Pepper include: 1. \\"King of Beverages\\" (1904): This early slogan positioned Dr Pepper as a superior drink in the crowded soft drink market. 2. \\"Distinctively Different\\" (1920s-1930s): In an effort to stand out from other soft drinks, this slogan emphasized the drink's unique flavor. 3. \\"The Most Original Soft Drink Ever\\" (1940s): Recognizing that its taste could not be replicated, Dr Pepper used this slogan to highlight its uniqueness. 4. \\"The Friendly Pepper Upper\\" (1950s): This slogan portrayed Dr Pepper as a cheerful and uplifting beverage that can brighten your day. 5. \\"Be a Pepper\\" (1977): The \\"Be a Pepper\\" campaign, which featured the catchy song \\"I’m a Pepper,\\" encouraged people to embrace their individuality and join the Dr Pepper community. 6. \\"Hold Out for the Out of the Ordinary\\" (1980s): The campaign encouraged people to be unique and not settle for anything less than extraordinary. Today, Dr Pepper is owned by the Keurig Dr Pepper company and continues to attract consumers who appreciate the one-of-a-kind taste. As the soda industry grows and evolves, Dr Pepper ensures its advertising campaigns and marketing strategies are refreshed to remain relevant, engaging, and captivating for its audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Amy Pankratz spent a few nights in the hospital with her daughter, Isabella, who caught a bad flu. \\"Lying in bed beside Isabella, I could hear the cries of children in pain, \\"says Amy. \\"It completely broke my heart.\\" When Isabella was getting well and could leave her room, she wore her prized possession--a \\"superhero cape \\" Amy had sewn to encourage her--and walked into the hallway. The pink cape was an instant hit with the other young patients, who were doing exercise around the nursing station. \\"Then, all the kidswere taking turns wearing the cape, giggling, \\"Amy says. \\"These were some of the same children I had heard crying the night before, and here they were playing and having fun--kids just being kids!\\" From that moment on, Amy began making Comfort Capes for little ones battling with serious illnesses. \\"I felt God presenting an opportunity, \\"she says. \\"I hoped Comfort Capes can help these kids feel brave, to lift some of the fear away. \\" Since then, Amy has made and donated more than 5, 000 capes in the United States. Amy usually pays for materials herself, although she accepts donations. The capes she makes for kids in treatment are different from those her own children have. Before Amy starts to sew she learns what image or character the little boy or girl connects with. \\"I choose the pattern, color and theme specially for each child,\\" explains Amy. When she is not sewing, Amy is raising awareness of childhood cancers and looking into ways to get Comfort Capes to more kids who need them, \\"If a cape can help a child, even only for a moment, forget his illness, it's worth the time spent sewing,\\" she says. Question: Which of the following can be the best title of the passage? Options: A: Turning Sick Kids into Superheroes B: How to Treat the Sick Children C: A strong Mom Who Helps Others D: Amy: a Considerate Woman The answer is:","completion":"A: Turning Sick Kids into Superheroes Step 1: Read the article and understand the content. The article is about Amy Pankratz, who started making Comfort Capes for children with serious illnesses after seeing how her daughter's cape brought joy to the other young patients in the hospital. Step 2: Analyze the available options. A: Turning Sick Kids into Superheroes - This title encapsulates the idea that Amy's Comfort Capes transform the sick children into superheroes and bring joy to their lives. B: How to Treat the Sick Children - This title is misaligned with the primary focus of the article, which is about the Comfort Capes, not general treatment for sick children. C: A strong Mom Who Helps Others - While this captures the fact that Amy is a mother who helps others, it does not provide specific information about the Comfort Capes. D: Amy: a Considerate Woman - This title mentions Amy but does not make any reference to her work with Comfort Capes. Step 3: Determine the best title. Based on the analysis, Option A: Turning Sick Kids into Superheroes includes the primary focus of the article and highlights the impact Comfort Capes have on the children. Therefore, it is the best title for the passage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write the next sentence.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve -7348 = -5716*m + 5382*m for m.. What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the given equation for 'm', you should first gather all the 'm' terms on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side if necessary. In this case, all 'm' terms are on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side, so we can directly proceed to the next step. The equation given is -7348 = -5716*m + 5382*m If we simplify the right side of the equation by performing addition/subtraction, we get: -7348 = (-5716 + 5382)*m Hence, -7348 = -334*m Now, in order to isolate 'm', we should divide -7348 by -334. So, we have: m = -7348 / -334 It's important to remember that dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result. Thus, m = 7348 / 334. Now, by performing the division, we get: ⁠m ≈ 22.01197604790419 So, the solution to the equation -7348 = -5716*m + 5382*m is m ≈ 22.01197604790419."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What does Adrian Kingsley-Hughes say of his thoughts on the origins of the interface?\\" is in \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\".

The AP and Google ( GOOG - news - people ) have been debating content and compensation issues for months. In an interview with Forbes on Wednesday, Curley warned that if Google doesn't strike the right deal with the AP soon, \\"They will not get our copy going forward.\\" The threat follows Rupert Murdoch's accusation earlier this month that Google is committing copyright thievery when it borrows material from news stories to assemble search rankings. A few days later, the AP weighed in with a similar charge--though it did not mention Google--announcing a content protection initiative and threatening legal and legislative action against news aggregators. The AP, a 163-year-old cooperative owned by news organizations, won't discuss its talks with Google, but plans to create landing pages and Web-based \\"news maps\\" directing users to original AP stories (and away from secondary sources who post material \\"borrowed\\" from the AP). To do this, the AP needs Google's help. Most likely that means Google creating search protocols similar to those created from the licensing deal the AP inked with Google in 2006. Since that deal was struck, Google has paid the AP undisclosed fees to carry AP content on the Google News section of the site. Search rankings on Google News give priority to recognizable news brands like the AP. But Google applies no such algorithmic discretion to general searches. The broader search rankings spread AP content out across the Web, says Curley, encouraging misappropriation by other sites. Curley wants Google to \\"protect content from unauthorized use and pay us for the longtail.\\" By \\"longtail,\\" Curley refers to the thousands of small sites that collectively drive vast herds of traffic using AP content. A lot has changed online since the AP's initial license deal with Google was struck. Is Curley's threat a re-boot of an earlier tactic? The 2006 agreement with Google was reached only after the AP threatened to sue Google for infringement, says Curley. \\"They threw us a bone,\\" he says. Now he wants the rest of the meal.","completion":"The boss of the Associated Press, Tom Curley, said that they are not happy with Google.

Murdoch wrote to the parliamentary committee on Tuesday to tell them that his lawyers have advised him that he should not submit himself for questioning until all the criminal trials relating to the News of the World and the Sun are over. Under the current court schedule this may not be until July 2014 but with potential appeals and more trials it could be 2015. John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, said: \\"The committee received a letter from News Corp setting out legal advice that he had received, but at the same time the committee received its own advice that there was a risk that any questions might prejudice the trials. On that basis we have decided not to pursue it at this stage.\\" It is understood that the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, and the speaker's counsel, Michael Carpenter, wrote to the committee counselling them not to go ahead with their planned interrogation. A spokesman for News Corp said its advice was that \\"there is, to put it at its lowest, a substantial risk that any questions from the committee on the subject you identify would touch on matters relevant to the criminal trial, and a substantial risk that any answers would seriously impede or prejudice the course of justice\\". Murdoch had agreed to appear before the committee when invited in July to answer fresh questions over secret tape recordings of a meeting he had with more than 20 Sun journalists who have been arrested in connection with alleged unlawful payments to police and other public officials for stories. The first trial related to the activities of News International, which is now renamed News UK, is scheduled to start on 28 October and involves eight defendants including Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and David Cameron's former spin doctor, Andy Coulson, who was a former News of the World editor. Brooks and Coulson have pleaded not guilty; their trial is expected to last until mid February. Three more trials have been scheduled to take place after that with the latest pencilled in for June.

Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5). Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point \\"X\\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration. The skill in being a student consists of getting one's daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person to person, and even in the same person it varies from week to week. You must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find yourself reading the same paragraph over and over again and not taking it in, that's a pretty good sign you've reached your highest point for the day and should stop.

The reviewer expresses discontent and disappointment in the work of various filmmakers, giving the impression they believe their work is low in quality or problematic in its content. Here is a more detailed analysis of the sentiment: 1. The reviewer opens the review by referring to the films as \\"eleven pieces of garbage.\\" This is a strong indicator of negative sentiment, showing a discontentment towards all movies in the series. 2. The sentence \\"Eleven minutes each of sheer tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence,\\" illustrates a negative sentiment, indicating the reviewer perceives the films as dull, deceptively subtle, patronizing, and self-gratifying. 3. The reviewer seems to be unsatisfied with the treatment of topics by the filmmakers. For example, when mentioning Yussef Chahine's film, the reviewer appears to express disdain for what they perceive as a celebration of terrorism. This indicates a sentiment of disapproval for the director's approach. 4. The reviewer derides Amos Gitai for focusing on a \\"jerky newscaster\\", and criticizes Alejandro González Iñárritu for seemingly forgetting to turn on his camera'. This suggests the reviewer found their contributions to be lacking in quality and substance, again emphasizing a negative sentiment. 5. Regarding Sean Penn's piece, the reviewer indicates inaccuracy in the film's portrayal, further showing dissatisfaction and contributing to the overall negative sentiment. 6. With regard to the piece by Shohei Imamura, the reviewer mentions that he \\"ignored the whole thing\\". Here, the sentiment is again negative due to expressed displeasure in their perceived lack of attention or focus. 7. Regarding Claude Lelouch and Ken Loach, negative sentiment is inferred from comments suggesting that the directors focused on trivial, cliched, or irrelevant aspects in their pieces.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. Now, I have a new situation: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right. Answer this question please: Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","completion":"In the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal. This is because, as you move from left to right across a period, the atomic number (number of protons) increases, and so does the number of electrons. Metals are typically found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are found on the right side. Elements in between, such as metalloids, have properties of both metals and nonmetals. Using the fourth row (period 4) as an example, which James is currently studying, we can compare Potassium (K), a metal, to Krypton (Kr), a nonmetal. Potassium has an atomic number of 19, which means it has 19 electrons. Krypton has an atomic number of 36, meaning it has 36 electrons. In this case, Krypton, the nonmetal, has a higher number of electrons than Potassium, the metal."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed. At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of food, water, raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of wastes, damage, and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system. Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any complex system (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the \`\`carrying capacity'' of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, doors, windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical biospheric life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, self-perpetuation, and self-repair.

Given the following context: MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice?

Write highlights for this article: Facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful, especially for those who have been away for a long time. Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27. Dugard was 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from a bus stop in South Lake Tahoe, California. She allegedly was kept in a series of backyard sheds by a convicted sex offender and gave birth to two children in captivity. A bail review hearing is scheduled for Monday in El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California, for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who face charges related to Dugard's kidnapping. In Illinois, Shannon Wilfong is charged with child abduction, allegedly having forced 6-year-old Richard K. Wilfong Chekevdia to live in seclusion and be hidden, at times in crawl spaces and the attic, for nearly two years, according to court documents. In concealing the boy, Wilfong violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to Michael Chekevdia, the documents said. The boy is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, according to CNN affiliate WSIL. The situations of Dugard and Chekevdia are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world. The people who have been away often feel conflicted about leaving the situation they've acclimated to in order to rejoin the loved ones they've left behind, experts not connected to the cases tell CNN. Photos: Missing children who were found. Sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother, and \\"extreme tactics\\" may be used, although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces, said Jay Lebow, psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University. \\"While this case is obviously the rarest of things, other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this,\\" Lebow said. The case of Dugard. Dugard is spending time in \\"a secluded place, reconnecting\\" with her mother and younger sister, said her aunt, Tina Dugard, in a statement on behalf of her family. \\"This is a joyful time for my family,\\" she said. \\"Jaycee remembers all of us.\\" But a person in Dugard's situation would most likely have both positive and negative feelings about leaving the only environment she's known for 18 years and coming back to her family, psychologists say. \\"She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family,\\" said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California. After allegedly being confined for 18 years, Dugard probably would find the outside world frightening, Lebow said. \\"You get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world, but it's the world you know,\\" he said. Experts say Dugard may have developed what is known as Stockholm syndrome, in which kidnapping victims identify with their captors. Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family. \\"It's a concept that explains why a kidnapped victim would stay with a perpetrator even though they had an opportunity to leave,\\" she said. \\"They opt to stay because it's their comfort zone.\\" But Johanna Tabin, a psychologist in Glencoe, Illinois, said Dugard's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity. Police said Phillip Garrido, one of her alleged abductors, is believed to be the father of her two daughters, and his relationship to Dugard -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation, Tabin said. It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said. \\"Did she secretly mourn them?\\" Tabin asked. \\"Did she feel she stepped on a different planet where she was all of a sudden a grown-up 11-year-old and wasn't being treated anymore like a child?\\" Her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping, Tabin said. At the same time, someone in Dugard's situation may have asked herself at the outset, \\"Why did they let me get kidnapped?\\" Lebow said. There is an infinite range of responses, but more information about Dugard's feelings growing up and in captivity would inform how she adjusts to her new life, Tabin said. The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said. \\"It's basically like a wild child who may have had some contact with civilization, but basically is having to start life all over again, and that may be overwhelming to them at first,\\" she said. Napoletano said she would suggest to a family like Dugard's to be accepting and supportive, and not ask a lot of questions. \\"Go about your daily life as usual for the most part, and take the lead from the therapist, one small step at a time,\\" she said. Lebow advises them against looking for some sudden moment of reconnection, but rather to be loving and patient. Coming back from combat. Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a \\"hellacious war,\\" Lebow said. A recent survey of military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful, according to three-quarters of respondents. Reunification brings excitement and relief, which is sometimes accompanied by emotional conflict, the surveyors said. Read more about the study. In the military, bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together, Tabin said. When service members come home, they may find life \\"shallower,\\" and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said. In a case where a husband has been away at war and returns to his wife, the desire to understand one another's feelings is fundamental, she said. \\"She wants to be understanding, he wants to be able to shove it aside, then he has nightmares, and she says, 'you're not setting it aside,' \\" Tabin said. \\"Well, consciously he is -- he's not awake when he dreams.\\" Don't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences, Napoletano said. She also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war. Waking up in the morning, going grocery shopping, washing clothes and doing other day-to-day activities help create a stable, comforting environment, she said.","completion":"Jaycee Dugard was missing for 18 years after she was taken from a bus stop.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Global Positioning Systems are now a part of everyday driving in many countries.These satellitebased systems provide turnbyturn directions to help people get to where they want to go.However,they can also cause a lot of problems,send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost.Many times,the driver is to blame.Sometimes a GPS error is responsible.Most often,says Barry Brown,it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,\\"They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,\\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Mr Brown says,\\"One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills.\\" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together. Question: Which of the followings is one of the shortcomings of GPS equipment? Answer: OPTIONS: + It just tells the driver to turn once at a time.. + It gives the driver the overview.. + Its screen is too small to be seen clearly.. + It is only suitable for passive drivers..","completion":"One of the shortcomings of GPS equipment is: It just tells the driver to turn once at a time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: angola declines to confirm extradition of nigerian militant Text:","completion":"Angola has reportedly declined to confirm the extradition of a Nigerian militant, whose identity remains undisclosed. The situation has fueled speculation and concerns regarding the parties involved and the nature of the matter at hand. Discussions around the extradition of the Nigerian militant have been taking place between Angola and Nigerian authorities, but no formal announcement or confirmation has been given by Angola. This hesitation has raised several questions about the reasons behind Angola's reticence and the relationship between the countries involved. The Nigerian militant, whose identity remains undisclosed, is allegedly involved in various criminal activities, including but not limited to terrorism, insurgency, and organized crime. The extradition would potentially help in curbing criminal activities in both Nigeria and Angola, and ensure regional stability. As Angola continues to withhold information on the matter, the international community is closely following the case and anxiously awaiting Angola's next move. The lack of transparency has led to increased scrutiny and could potentially strain relations between the two countries in the long run. The eventual outcome of this situation depends on Angola's decision to confirm or deny the extradition request, and its underlying rationale. As both countries are part of the international community combating terrorism and organized crime, it is essential for them to work together and uphold their commitments to maintaining peace and security in the region. Until Angola provides a clear stance on the extradition, uncertainty will continue to surround the case, putting pressure on the diplomatic relations between Angola and Nigeria. It is hoped that a favorable resolution will be reached in due course, to ensure that justice is served and regional stability is preserved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have this equation: 309*q + 316*q + 6 = 637*q - 966 1. First, let's add the terms with \\"q\\" on the left side: (309*q + 316*q) then it becomes 625*q. So now our equation looks like this: 625*q + 6 = 637*q - 966 2. Next, we want to put all the terms with \\"q\\" on one side. So, we subtract 625*q from both sides: 625*q + 6 - 625*q = 637*q - 966 -625*q The left side's q terms will cancel each other out, and we get: 6 = 12*q - 966 3. Now, we want to get the \\"q\\" term all by itself, so let's get rid of that -966. We'll add 966 to both sides: 6 + 966 = 12*q - 966 + 966 972 = 12*q 4. Finally, we need to find the value of \\"q\\". We'll do that by dividing both sides by 12: 972 / 12 = 12*q / 12 81 = q So, the solution to the problem is q = 81.

They allow a young boy to enter the house but the infected have followed him and break in. The others are killed. Don abandons Alice to save himself.Twenty eight weeks later, the infected have all starved to death. An American-led NATO force has secured parts of London and is now allowing the return of English citizens who had been abroad during the outbreak.

Everyone lives in the Green Zone, a secured area on the Isle of Dogs, a peninsula on the East End of London. Snipers patrol the rooftops in case of another outbreak. Leaving the Green Zone is forbidden because troops are still cleaning up the corpses that have been rotting for six months. Don manages one of the apartment buildings in the zone. He tells Tammy and Andy that he tried to save their mother but there was no hope. Tammy and Andy decide to sneak out into London and visit their old home to retrieve personal items.

How is \\"Servomechanism\\" said in Russian?","completion":"\\"Servomechanism\\" translates to \\"сервомеханизм\\" (servomekhanizm) in Russian. A servomechanism, or a servo, is a closed-loop control system that uses feedback to control the position or motion of an output device such as a motor, valve, or actuator. In Russian, the term \\"сервомеханизм\\" accurately conveys this concept, and refers to the same type of system used in various fields like engineering, robotics, and automation. Similar to servomechanism's function in English, \\"сервомеханизм\\" in Russian is used to describe a system that is designed to accept input signals, compare those signals to a desired output or setpoint, and control the output to reach the desired position or motion. It can work with different types of motors, such as direct current (DC) motors, alternating current (AC) motors, or stepper motors. In both Russian and English, servomechanisms are characterized by their ability to provide high precision, accuracy, and stability in controlling their output, which makes them essential components in many technological applications. They are commonly used in industrial automation, aerospace engineering, and robotics systems, ensuring that equipment functions correctly, efficiently, and with minimal errors. In summary, the term \\"сервомеханизм\\" (servomekhanizm) is the Russian equivalent of \\"servomechanism,\\" referring to a closed-loop control system that uses feedback to maintain precise control over an output device's position, speed, or motion. The term is used in various contexts and industries in Russia, just as it is in English-speaking countries, and conveys the same essential concept of a highly accurate, responsive, and stable control system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What will happen to Aubrey? A:","completion":"Aubrey's decision to inform her friends about leaving may result in a variety of consequences and potential changes in her relationships and life. Although it is difficult to predict the exact outcome for Aubrey, we can discuss some possible scenarios that could happen based on the information provided. 1. Emotional reactions from friends: As Aubrey has sent text messages informing her friends about her departure, it is likely that her friends will show a range of emotional reactions. These may include expressions of surprise, concern, disappointment, or understanding. Their emotional reactions could be influenced by factors such as the closeness of their relationship with Aubrey, the specific circumstances of her departure, and their personalities. 2. Support from friends: While some of Aubrey's friends may express their disappointment or sadness about her leaving, others might offer their support and understanding. They may encourage her to follow her dreams, wish her the best, or even provide assistance in the form of advice, emotional encouragement, or practical help with her move. 3. Keeping in touch: Depending on the reason behind Aubrey's departure and the strength of her relationships with her friends, she may choose to maintain contact with them. This could include staying in touch through social media, video calls, texting, emails, or even occasionally visiting each other. The distance might affect some friendships, but others might flourish due to the effort both parties make to maintain the connection. 4. New social dynamics: Aubrey's departure could lead to a shift in the social dynamics within her friend group. Some friends may grow closer to one another, while others may drift apart due to the absence of the common connection with Aubrey. This might lead to new social groups forming or a reshuffling of friendships within the existing group. 5. Personal growth for Aubrey: Leaving her friends behind could lead to significant personal growth for Aubrey. She may be faced with new challenges as she adjusts to her new environment, be it a new city, a new job, or a new chapter in her life. These experiences can help her develop new skills, expand her horizons, and gain a fresh perspective on life. It is also possible that her absence from her close friends may lead her to build new relationships and friendships in her new surroundings. 6. Potential feelings of homesickness and loneliness: Aubrey may experience feelings of homesickness and loneliness, missing her friends and the emotional support they provided. These feelings might come in waves and could be more intense during special occasions or when she faces difficulties in her new environment. She might have to work on developing new support systems and coping techniques to navigate the challenges that come with leaving her close friends behind. In conclusion, the outcome of Aubrey's departure on her life and friendships will be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as the specific reason behind her leaving, the strength and type of relationships she has with her friends, and the manner in which both Aubrey and her friends navigate the changes in their lives. While some friendships may be strained, others may evolve into long-lasting, deep connections. Ultimately, Aubrey will likely experience a mix of personal growth, changes in her relationships, and a variety of emotions as she moves forward to the next chapter of her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Edward James Livingstone ( September 12 , 1884 -- September 11 , 1945 ) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager . He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association , where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League . - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era. - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies, and the idea that globalization can be understood as largely created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947. - The National Hockey Association (NHA), officially the \\"National Hockey Association of Canada Limited\\", was a professional ice hockey organization with teams in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. It is the direct predecessor to today's National Hockey League (NHL). Founded in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brien, the NHA introduced 'six-man hockey' by removing the 'rover' position in 1911. During its lifetime, the league coped with competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners came to a head in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone). The remaining NHA team owners started the NHL in parallel as a temporary measure, to continue play while negotiations went on with Livingstone and other lawsuits were pending. A year later, after no progress was reached with Livingstone, the other NHA owners decided to permanently suspend the NHA. The NHA's rules, constitution and trophies were continued in the NHL. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - John Ambrose O'Brien (May 27, 1885 April 25, 1968), was an industrialist and sports team owner. He was a founder of the National Hockey Association (NHA), owner of the Renfrew Millionaires and the founding owner of the Montreal Canadiens professional ice hockey team. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - The major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the United States and Canada. The four leagues universally included in the definition are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). - The Toronto Hockey Club, known as the Torontos and the Toronto Blueshirts were a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were a member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club was founded in 1911 and began operations in 1912. The club won its sole Stanley Cup championship in 1914. - Mexico City, officially City of Mexico (, ; abbreviated as \\"CDMX\\"), is the capital and most populous city of the United Mexican States. As an \\"alpha\\" global city, Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in the Americas. It is located in the Valley of Mexico (\\"Valle de México\\"), a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of . The city consists of sixteen municipalities (previously called boroughs). - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter. I’m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

It does not, however, provide any information about their plans or actions beyond the face painting session. The hypothesis, \\"The women go and have lunch and then come back to finish the painting,\\" suggests that the women take a break from the painting for lunch, presumably to eat and possibly socialize, and then return to complete the painting afterwards. While the hypothesis presents a potential scenario that may or may not be inspired by the premise, the premise itself does not provide any evidence or details to support or refute the hypothesis. We are not given any information about the time, circumstances, or context of the lunch or the completion of the painting, so it is impossible to determine if this specific hypothesis aligns with the given premise. In other words, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true or not, since the focus of the premise is on the woman painting the girl's face, not on their actions outside of this specific activity. If additional information were provided about the woman, the blond girl, and their context, it might be possible to form a more definitive answer about the hypothesis's truthfulness.

It is important to analyze the information given and break it down to better understand the situation. Firstly, we were informed about a conversation with ethics counselor Howard Wilson on January 30, discussing the minister's involvement with the legislation. The legislation in question is presumably related to pension regulations. Secondly, we learned that the Canada Steamship Line (CSL) has a pension fund incorporated under the Pension Fund Societies Act. This means that there is a steamship line in Canada – the Canada Steamship Line. This information alone disproves the conclusion \\"Canada has no steamship line.\\" Further, we were informed that the CSL's pension fund operates under the Department of Industry and will not be directly affected by the Pension Benefit Standards Act. This information shows that the CSL is a legitimate entity in Canada. However, this information does not necessarily provide insights into the overall state of the steamship industry in Canada or how many steamship lines there are in the country. It does, however, tell us that the Canada Steamship Line exists and has a pension fund regulated by the Department of Industry. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it would be inaccurate to assert that Canada has no steamship line.

A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- When I saw these words on Twitter, I couldn't help but put down my tablet: \\"They say the smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry.\\" They weigh heaviest upon the heart. First the Sydney attack Monday, then all too soon there came the school killings Tuesday -- 145 people, 132 of them children -- in Peshawar, Pakistan. Tragedies are stacking up. There isn't enough time to grieve. To spend one minute of silence in honor of each of the lives lost would take more than two hours. The average life expectancy for men in Pakistan is about 66 years. These children killed at their school had some 50 years of life stolen from them — life that will never be lived. Think back on the last year. What did you accomplish? How many times did you laugh? How many act of kindness did you bring into the world? Think on all you did. Think of what could have been if these children had lived — of how each of their lives could have changed the world. It takes but one person, one moment, one conviction, to start a ripple of change. Because they can't, we must. Those stolen lifetimes deserve fulfillment. Those children's lives can still change the world. But it requires us to be called from despair to action. Although their deaths are senseless and tragic, their potential lives can unfold through us. The smallest coffins are the heaviest, but living for the child lightens our hearts. It is easy to fall into despair thinking about all that is wrong with the world. The joys seems so small in comparison. Internet videos of cats riding Roombas just can't compete with a father talking about how his dead 13-year-old son had wanted to be a pilot. How do we not yield to despair? Action is my antidote. I do something. The Taliban attacked a school -- and earlier had shot Malala, an education activist -- because they are scared. They fear the potential of education to change the world, and move beyond them. Education is the light that fights their darkness. It is up to us. The horror of their methods only redoubles our commitment to spreading the light. We know education is a human right and an unstoppable force. We can use our grief to activate and motivate us, to work so even more children are educated, to ensure that these child killings are the last throes of the Taliban's reign of terror. Not long after the devastating news of the attack, I began to see a growing online community, started in large party by people of Pakistani descent across the world, looking for ways to help those in need in. Each is seeking ways to honor those murdered in Peshawar. You don't have to donate. But at the very least, you can add your name to online pledges and join this community in saying, \\"Your terror only makes us fight harder.\\" If you want your checkbook to follow your heart, make a donation to those doing work you support. The Malala Fund is a great place to start. UNICEF and the Global Fund for Children are other established, well-respected organizations that do great work across the world for children. If you aren't in a positon to give money, get some skin in the game. In 2015, the Hult Prize challenge will provide quality education for 10 million children who live in urban slums.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: \\"Eight Miles High\\" is a song by the American rock band the Byrds, written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \\"Eight Miles High\\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \\"Why\\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. Context: The master recording of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in \\"Eight Miles High\\"--most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies. \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\" An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio. McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \\"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\\" This original version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension. Question: Do all of the band members prefer the original version? Answer:","completion":"While it is not explicitly documented whether all band members of the Byrds prefer the original version of \\"Eight Miles High,\\" it is evident that both Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn) and David Crosby have expressed their preference for it. McGuinn has stated that he believes the original version is more spontaneous sounding than the Columbia release, and Crosby has shared a similar sentiment, stating that the original version was \\"better\\" and \\"stronger\\" with more flow to it, and that it was how they wanted it to be. However, there is no information available about the opinions of the other band members, namely Gene Clark, Michael Clarke, and Chris Hillman, on this matter. It is important to note that opinions and preferences around music can differ greatly, even within a band. Therefore, without clear statements from all the band members, we cannot definitively conclude that all of them prefer the original version of \\"Eight Miles High.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, the drippings from fruits, vegetables, and meats can drip into the fan and become difficult to clean. When choosing a vertical dehydrator, consider ones with a bottom fan and be prepared for extra cleaning if you are dehydrating foods that may produce drippings. If you are dehydrating a variety of foods, look for models with adjustable trays. This allows you to organize your foods by type and by how much drying they require, giving you more control over the dehydration process. For instance, fruits like apples and bananas may take less time to dehydrate compared to meats or thicker vegetables. Therefore, being able to adjust your trays accordingly can ensure that all your foods are perfectly dehydrated. One additional tip when using a vertical dehydrator is to rotate your trays regularly. Because of the heat distribution, trays closer to the heat source will dehydrate faster. By rotating your trays, you can ensure uniform drying for all your foods. Bear in mind that dehydrating foods is a slow process. Depending on the type of food and the heat setting, it may take several hours or even days for your food to be fully dehydrated. Patience is key when using a dehydrator. Also, endeavor to store your dehydrated foods properly to maintain their quality and extend their shelf life. In summary, a vertical dehydrator can be a valuable tool for anyone looking to preserve their food through dehydration. It's a cost-effective and convenient choice, especially for individuals with limited kitchen space. Though it may require a bit more maintenance due to potential drippings in the fan system, the versatility and efficiency of these machines may make them an ideal choice for many home cooks. Nevertheless, ensure you weigh all these aspects before deciding on the right model for your dehydration needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","completion":"Given the situation and background information provided, Kenny will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm. This is because Kenny is currently growing tomatoes, which are not in season, and as a result, his use of fertilizer is low. On the other hand, Bobby has received a large order of potatoes and has significantly increased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm. Since rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away into bodies of water like ponds, the higher usage of fertilizer by Bobby will more likely contribute to a higher amount of fertilizer ending up in the ponds near his farm, compared to Kenny's lower usage of fertilizer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Unionist politicians have submitted an official challenge over a Sinn FÃ©in proposal to change the name of Londonderry to Derry.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unionist Politicians Challenge Sinn Féin's Proposal to Rename Londonderry as Derry Introduction: Unionist politicians have recently submitted an official challenge against a proposal put forth by Sinn Féin to change the name of Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest city, to Derry. This challenge highlights the ongoing political and cultural tensions between the two major political factions in Northern Ireland. In this article, we will delve into the underlying reasons for the name change proposal, the arguments posed by both sides, and the potential implications of this dispute on Northern Ireland's political landscape. Background and Context: The city of Londonderry, also commonly referred to as Derry, has a long and complicated history, with its name signifying a focal point of division between Nationalists, who primarily identify as Irish and Catholic, and Unionists, who predominantly identify as British and Protestant. Nationalists argue that the original name of the city is Derry and that the term \\"London\\" was added during the 17th-century colonization efforts by the British to strengthen ties to London. Consequently, Nationalists prefer the name Derry, whereas Unionists favor Londonderry. Sinn Féin's Name Change Proposal: Sinn Féin, a Nationalist political party in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has put forth a proposal to officially rename Londonderry as Derry. Their argument primarily revolves around historical accuracy and the honoring of the city's Irish heritage. Additionally, Sinn Féin and other Nationalists assert that the name Londonderry serves as a reminder of British colonization and oppression. Unionist Politicians' Challenge: In response to Sinn Féin's proposal, Unionist politicians have filed an official challenge, maintaining that the name Londonderry holds significant meaning for the Unionist community and that changing it would exacerbate divisions. Unionist representatives argue that such a change would undermine the political stability established by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which aimed to promote peace, reconciliation, and mutual respect between the two communities. Potential Implications of the Name Change Dispute: The dispute over the city's name reflects deeper political and cultural divisions within Northern Ireland, involving issues of identity, heritage, and political allegiances. An official renaming could potentially reignite simmering tensions between Nationalists and Unionists, while leaving the matter unresolved might continue to fuel debate and discontent. Looking forward, the challenge submitted by Unionist politicians may prompt further discussions and negotiation between the two factions. Achieving a mutually acceptable resolution is crucial for maintaining peace and facilitating collaboration between the Nationalist and Unionist communities. Conclusion: The official challenge filed by Unionist politicians against Sinn Féin's proposal to rename Londonderry as Derry underscores the ongoing struggle for identity and recognition in Northern Ireland. While the name change proposal seeks to honor the city's Irish roots, Unionists view it as a potential disruption to the fragile peace established by the Good Friday Agreement. It remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached that allows both communities to feel respected and acknowledged in their shared history and future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: What's the difference between a ship and a boat? Second question: \\"Why is a ship is called 'she' in English?\\" Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different aspects of ships and boats. First question: What's the difference between a ship and a boat? The primary differences between a ship and a boat lie in their size, function, and construction. 1. Size: Ships are generally larger than boats. A ship is defined as a large watercraft that is capable of deep-sea navigation and extensive voyages across oceans. They have a greater tonnage capacity, spacious cargo rooms, and a deeper draft. Boats, on the other hand, are smaller watercraft that are specialized for rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. They have a shallower draft, making them suitable for navigating smaller bodies of water. 2. Function: Ships are designed for long-distance travel, carrying cargo and/or passengers across vast stretches of open water. They are equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems, multiple watertight compartments, and complex propulsion systems. Boats, conversely, are used for a variety of purposes like fishing, sports, leisure, and short-distance transportation. Boats generally have less complex systems and are easier to operate. 3. Construction: Ships are constructed using high-quality materials for increased durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions. The construction of ships requires extensive planning, expertise, and well-established shipyards to develop these massive watercraft. Boats, in contrast, can be manufactured at a smaller facility and have a simpler construction that is typically less expensive than that of ships. 4. Crew: Ships have a larger crew compared to boats. Crew members on a ship have specific roles and responsibilities, such as navigation, engineering, and vessel management. Boats typically have a smaller crew and, in many cases, can be operated by a single person. Second question: \\"Why is a ship is called 'she' in English?\\" Referring to a ship as \\"she\\" is a historical convention in the English language, which has roots in tradition, anthropomorphism, and linguistics. 1. Tradition: Maritime tradition played a significant role in how ships were personified in the past. Ships were considered a form of protection and sustenance for sailors who spent months at sea. Sailors formed a deep attachment to their vessels, and ascribing a female gender to ships was a way to express that bond. Using \\"she\\" for the ship's pronoun is similar to how some people might refer to their cars as \\"she\\" today. This personification dates back centuries and cuts across many languages and cultures. 2. Anthropomorphism: Another reason is due to the personification of ships, where they are given human-like qualities to illustrate their nature. Ships, much like people, were believed to have personalities, and so they were given names and considered a part of the crew. Anthropomorphism was a way for people to understand and make sense of the world around them and create an emotional connection to an inanimate object. 3. Linguistics: Historically, some languages had different gender systems for nouns where objects were assigned a gender, either masculine or feminine. In Old English, gendered nouns existed, and many words associated with ships were feminine. Over time, as the English language simplified its grammatical gender, the tradition of referring to ships as female persisted. It is important to note that in recent years, more people choose to use gender-neutral terminology when referring to objects, including ships. This change addresses concerns about gender equality and linguistic accuracy. However, the custom of calling a ship \\"she\\" still endures in some maritime communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Raphael and Carlos are experienced in sailing and propose the idea of going for a sail. Faith initially expresses reservations due to her lack of experience, but Raphael and Carlos assure her that it's alright and she can learn. They reassure Faith that they plan to sail in a calm Mediterranean area, as opposed to the more demanding Southern Seas. This decision helps assuage Faith's apprehension, making her more excited about the trip. Then, the discussion moves towards deciding a specific location within the Mediterranean for their sailing trip. They consider both the Balearic Islands and Greece as potential destinations. Faith notices Carlos' preference to stay close to home (perhaps identified by his initial suggestion of the Balearic Islands). However, Carlos clarifies that he has no strong bias, stating he loves Greece too, indicating that he doesn't feel the pressure to choose one location over the other. Therefore, the conversation is about planning a summer sailing trip within a safe, beginner-friendly environment, while trying to decide on the specific location.

Super-agent Jorge Mendes has heaped praise on Cristiano Ronaldo by claiming the Ballon d'Or winner is a great role model for kids. Ronaldo picked up yet another award on Monday when he beat off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win the prestigious title for the third time. Mendes, who helped Ronaldo seal moves to Manchester United and Real Madrid in 2003 and 2009 respectively, believes the 29-year-old's ambition to reach the top will have a positive influence on youngsters. Cristiano Ronaldo - pictured with his son - is a great role model, according to his agent Jorge Mendes. The 29-year-old superstar gives his son Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr a kiss during the Ballon d'Or Gala. Speaking after the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Mendes said: 'He is a great professional and that is fundamental today for a player to perform better on the pitch. Cristiano is a professor. 'Cristiano is an example for the boys who want to triumph, who want to go on to become the best in the world. He is also a great example for our society and our country, to make us more determined, more ambitious. He is an example for the youngsters and the adults. 'He has never stood with his arms folded. He always wanted to be better and he has that same ambition today.'

After reading other reviews of this place, I decided to check it out after work with Jason O. for a healthy and fresh Japanese dinner. I am disappointed to report that Wasabi offered sub-par sushi and even worse cooked items. My judgement of a sushi restaurant's quality of sushi comes in the tasting of two different types of nigiri. The first always being tamago as it is the piece with the lowest payoff for a sushi restaurant (if they take pride in their sushi, they will do the tamago correctly). The second is going to be a well textured, but very delicate cut of fish (on this day it was halibut). The tamago was presented fallen over and was overly sweet with a \\"frozen\\" taste to it. The halibut was not even prepared correctly, there was no grated yuzu (I may be asking for too much at this point) and no salt on the on the fish (you do not use soy sauce for a fish like halibut). The fish itself did not have a clean flavor and an off-putting texture. Finally, the most unforgiving of sins against sushi that Wasabi commits is their packing of sushi. Sushi rice is not to be packed so tight as you are supposed to dip the sushi FISH SIDE DOWN. I am sorry to say that grocery store sushi is better than the offerings here. We then had the calamari appetizer. I don't even know where to begin here. Calamari should not be like onion rings (in other words, the batter should not fall off of the squid like an onion ring. Utterly disappointing. Finally, we ended with the unagi dinner. The fillets of eel were obviously pre-frozen/pre-cooked, drenched in eel sauce, served atop a bed of rice that could feed a family of five, and also contained bones. The side to this dish was not the usual fresh or pickled vegetables that one would find traditionally used to cut the richness of properly prepared unagi, but was instead limp and bitter sauteed cabbage. All in all, this was a very disappointing meal and I would be embarrassed to serve this food and call it \\"Japanese.\\" I rarely ever give out 1 star, but usually 1-star reviews go to venues that have rats and cockroaches.

The answer to the question: What college presents a symmetrical front to New Road? is inside the article: The college presents a symmetrical front to New Road and the castle mound, with four small gables between a larger gable at either end. There are two quadrangles, with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle (to the east) to the lower quadrangle (to the west). Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle, whilst the hall, library, and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle. The buildings are two storeys high, with dormers above. There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two); the writer Simon Jenkins said that these are \\"almost puddles\\", and saw them as relics of Harrison's Mediterranean plan. The writer Peter Sager, however, thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site. The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the hall on its east side. The square-mullioned windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close-set groups of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the common room has a larger bay window. An abstract sculpture by Hubert Dalwood, from 1962, has been positioned on the lawn inside the college. Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle, although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented, \\"leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose\\". The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels. The furniture in the hall was designed by, and the chairs were built by, Edward Barnsley. Lord Nuffield's coat of arms are displayed over the fireplace, carved from a single piece of stone, and his portrait, painted by Sir Arthur Cope, hangs in the hall. The chapel, on the south side of the college, can seat forty people.

Joel Morales, 12, committed suicide after a two-year barrage of bullying because of his small stature, according to his family. Now the boy’s family from East Harlem, New York have filed a law suit against the city, the Board of Education and four youths. His mother, Lisbeth Babilonia, said the bullies hassled Joel every day, throwing pencils and taunting him. In the suit, Joel was described as ‘a small-framed, fragile boy who sometimes stuttered and had problems with fine motor skills. He was extremely short and underweight for his age’. He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News . The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants. The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit. Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents. After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him. Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’ Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school. The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year. Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give me a hug and a kiss.”’ At the time of Joel’s death, it was revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough. A 'beautiful boy': Joel suffered physical and emotional abuse, and while his mother complained to the Board of Education it did little to alleviate the situation Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself. Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR. Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died. Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.' The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.' In April this year, Rehtaeh Parsons from Nova Scotia, Canada hanged herself after four boys raped her and spread a photograph of the assault, causing classmates and friends to taunt and cyber-bully her, her mother has said. Driven from school: Joel was taunted by classmates at Public School 102 (pictured) in East Harlem, New York before his family transferred him to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school Joel's mother Lisbeth Babilonia revealed he always said: 'I love you mum.

Joel transferred schools, his mother Lizbeth Babilonia contacted the police, and she tried to get her and her son transferred to another housing project. But still, Joel took his own life on May 29, 2012. Now, Babilonia is suing the city, the Board of Education, and the individual bullies who tormented Joel, as well as their parents. The suit claims Babilonia \\"complained multiple times per week to Department of Education personnel,\\" but the bullies were not disciplined. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The family of a 12-year-old boy, Joel Morales, who committed suicide after being bullied for two years, is suing the city, the Board of Education, and the four alleged bullies.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Liam, who read about apex predators, learned more about predators with no natural predators. This is because apex predators, also known as alpha predators or top predators, are the ones that sit at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. These apex predators play a critical role in maintaining the balance and overall health of an ecosystem. On the other hand, Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Grazers and large herbivores are primary consumers, meaning they consume primary producers such as plants to obtain their energy and nutrients. While these animals play an essential role in their respective ecosystems and can be prey for predators, they are not the top of the food chain like apex predators. In summary, Liam's focus on apex predators provided him with knowledge specifically about predators with no natural predators, while Fox's focus on grazers and large herbivores covered animals lower in the food chain, which are often hunted by predators, but are not themselves apex predators. Therefore, Liam learned more about predators with no natural predators in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Zero-Gravity Wreaks Chaos on Long Hair During Televised Presidential Call Subtitle: An Unintended Celestial Consequence of Long Hair as President Obama Makes a Historical Call to Space In a rather peculiar and comical event, zero-gravity seemed to challenge the traditional norms of grooming during an important televised phone call made by President Obama. As humanity pushes the boundaries of space exploration and frequently conducts astronauts' interactions with the Earth, we get to witness not only the exciting developments of science and technology but also the unforeseen and humorous effects of the space environment on human life. President Obama's call was meant to highlight and appreciate the astronauts' contributions towards significantly advancing our understanding of space, reflecting the administration's commitment to inspiring future generations for more daring space excursions. While the entire event was groundbreaking and showed incredible cooperation between the White House and space agencies, it had an unexpected twist that sent a wave of laughter across viewers and participants alike. Long hair, a simple and common trait among billions of people on Earth, proved to be a playful contender in space. As the astronauts conversed with the president, their long hair floated in every conceivable direction, defying both gravity and their attempts to maintain a composed appearance. Remarkably, even during this serious and formal communication, the zero-gravity environment provided moments of lighthearted entertainment that reminded us of the many unique challenges faced by astronauts in their daily lives. This incident brings forth an interesting aspect of human adaptability and resilience, albeit in a humorous light. The astronauts, despite the floating hair and distractions, maintained their professionalism and dedication to their mission, responding thoughtfully to the president's questions and providing insightful details of their experiences and discoveries. In the meantime, President Obama himself seemed to take the situation in stride, acknowledging the astronauts' endeavors with a contagious sense of humor. The hair-raising rendezvous also demonstrated that space exploration comes with its fair share of surprises. It is not just the cosmic events or the breathtaking imagery that interest researchers and space enthusiasts, but also the day-to-day challenges that contribute to the collective human experience in space. From eating and sleeping to exercising and personal grooming, astronauts are constantly adapting and learning how to navigate life in an out-of-this-world environment. This televised phone call has not only garnered attention for the astronauts' impressive achievements but also provided a valuable lesson: to embrace humor and adaptability in even the most professional and high-stakes situations. The unfaltering grace and poise exhibited by the astronauts, despite their uncooperative locks, have not only humanized space activities but also serves as an inspiration for aspiring young astronauts, showcasing the lighter side of this demanding profession. In conclusion, the zero-gravity long-haired debacle during President Obama's call to space has immortalized itself as a symbol of the challenges that come hand-in-hand with the enormity of space exploration—and the human ability to rise above them. The global community will undoubtedly maintain this conversation about the vastness of the cosmos, as we continue expanding the horizons of our knowledge, conquering new frontiers and, occasionally, tending to the mischief of unruly hair in space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: which category of food provides the most riboflavin?","completion":"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is an essential nutrient required for various bodily functions including energy production, normal cell growth and function, and maintaining overall good health. It is an important water-soluble vitamin that cannot be synthesized by the human body, meaning we must obtain riboflavin from our diet to meet daily requirements. The category of food that provides the most riboflavin includes dairy products, meat, and certain plant-based foods. Let's explore these categories to see which specific foods are top sources of riboflavin: 1. Dairy products: Dairy products, particularly milk and milk-based products, are the most significant sources of riboflavin. Including these in your diet can help ensure you get enough of this essential vitamin. Key dairy sources of riboflavin include: a. Milk (cow's milk, goat's milk) b. Cheese (cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, Brie) c. Yogurt (both plain and flavored) d. Cottage cheese e. Kefir 2. Meat and animal-based products: Aside from dairy products, several meat and animal-based foods are also rich in riboflavin. Some examples are: a. Organ meats (liver, kidney, heart) b. Beef (steak, ground beef) c. Poultry (chicken, turkey) d. Pork (tenderloin, ham) e. Fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, tuna) f. Eggs (both whole eggs and egg yolks) 3. Plant-based riboflavin sources: Certain plant-based foods also contain riboflavin, albeit in lower amounts compared to dairy and animal-based products. Vegetarians and vegans can obtain riboflavin from the following food sources: a. Nuts and seeds (almonds, pistachios, sunflower seeds) b. Leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens) c. Whole grains (brown rice, barley, quinoa, oats) d. Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, and soybeans) e. Mushrooms (shiitake, maitake, cremini, white button) Fortified foods are also a significant source of riboflavin, especially for those who consume a more restrictive diet. Many manufacturers add riboflavin to products like breakfast cereals, bread, and non-dairy milk alternatives such as almond milk and soy milk. In summary, while many food categories provide riboflavin in varying amounts, the category with the highest concentration of riboflavin is dairy products, followed by meat and animal-based products. It is important to consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of food sources to meet daily riboflavin requirements and maintain overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The combination of these two terms exhibits a strong sense of well-being experienced by the person. 2. \\"Much more calm\\": Calmness is generally perceived as an advantageous state of being, as it implies composure and emotional stability. In this context, being \\"much more calm\\" indicates a positive improvement in the emotional state of the person, a feeling that is inherently desirable. 3. \\"Positive\\": This keyword directly emphasizes the optimistic attitude experienced by the person on this particular day - a clear indication of the pleasant sentiment expressed in the tweet. 4. \\"Hopefully\\": The author expresses hope for more experiences with the same characteristics as the one described in the tweet.

Does \\"Wang and Nyima state that, despite the fact that the Ming refrained from sending troops to subdue Tibet and refrained from garrisoning Ming troops there, these measures were unnecessary so long as the Ming court upheld close ties with Tibetan vassals and their forces.\\" correctly answer the question of When did the Hongwu Emperor use military force in Tibet?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Wang and Nyima state that, despite the fact that the Ming refrained from sending troops to subdue Tibet and refrained from garrisoning Ming troops there, these measures were unnecessary so long as the Ming court upheld close ties with Tibetan vassals and their forces\\" does not correctly answer the question of when did the Hongwu Emperor use military force in Tibet. Instead, the statement discusses the general view by the scholars, Wang, and Nyima, on how the Ming Dynasty maintained its relationship with Tibet during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor. The Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). He officially ascended to the throne in 1368 and ruled until his death in 1398. The question of when the Hongwu Emperor used military force in Tibet pertains specifically to the period of his rule, which is not directly addressed in the statement given. During the Hongwu Emperor's reign, the relationship between the Ming Dynasty and Tibet was characterized by a system of what could be described as suzerainty, where Tibetan religious and political authorities acknowledged the Ming Dynasty's supremacy in lieu of direct military intervention from the Ming court. To strengthen and maintain the relationship with Tibetan vassal lords and their forces, the Ming court sent envoys, established tributary relations, granted titles and official positions, and frequently exchanged gifts and religious relics. This strategic approach was largely a continuation established by the previous dynasty, the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), who recognized the importance of Tibetan Buddhism and its influence in the region. The Yuan Dynasty had maintained a more direct level of control over Tibet by appointing a high-level commissioner called the \\"Sakya Dpon-chen,\\" which was established under the rule of Kublai Khan. Under the Ming Dynasty and the Hongwu Emperor's reign, the Sino-Tibetan relationship relied on maintaining close ties with Tibetan vassals, rather than resorting to direct military intervention or garrisoning troops in Tibet. As the statement highlights, scholars Wang and Nyima argue that this approach was effective in maintaining control over Tibet without the need for military force. To provide a clear-cut answer to the question, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the Hongwu Emperor used military force in Tibet during his reign from 1368 to 1398. The emperor primarily relied on political and religious ties, engaging with Tibetan vassals to maintain the influence of the Ming Dynasty in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Question: \\"What alert caused the CIA's managers believe that they had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year, and caused Tenet to want a boost in overall funds for the CIA?\\" Response: \\"1998 embassy bombings\\" [i] no; [ii] yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response doesn't correctly answer the question.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? smart , compelling drama","completion":"The phrase \\"smart, compelling drama\\" can be considered as positive. Let's break down the adjectives and analyze their meanings to better understand why this is a positive phrase. 1. Smart: In this context, \\"smart\\" refers to something that showcases intelligence and sophistication. When it comes to drama, a smart piece would be well-researched, thoughtfully written, and presented in a way that is engaging and insightful for the audience. The use of \\"smart\\" as an adjective suggests that the drama being described is not a run-of-the-mill or cliched offering, but rather an elevated and well-crafted piece of art. 2. Compelling: A compelling drama is one that captures the audience's attention and draws them in emotionally. It typically possesses a strong underlying theme, captivating characters, and an engaging plot that keeps the viewers invested from beginning to end. Calling a drama \\"compelling\\" means that it has the power to evoke emotions in the audience, holding their attention and even urging them to reflect on the different aspects of the narrative. When combined, \\"smart\\" and \\"compelling\\" create a powerful description that strongly implies a high-quality piece of work. In the case of a drama, it suggests a production that is intellectually stimulating and emotionally gripping, offering an experience to the audience that they would not want to miss. Therefore, the phrase \\"smart, compelling drama\\" can be deemed a positive description, as it conveys praise for the work and highlights its standout characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John Maylam, 45, who was in charge of buying potato crops for the supermarket, allowed Greenvale, a major supplier, to overcharge Sainsbury’s by £8.7million for its crop in a £40million deal. Using complex financial arrangements, he was able to artificially inflate the price without his bosses noticing. heard how Maylam and","completion":"Maylam's co-conspirator, Greenvale executive David Baxter, engaged in a fraudulent scheme that lasted several years. Baxter, 50, also faced legal consequences for his involvement and was handed a 30-month prison sentence by the court. The two men had been working together since 2006, establishing a network of secret arrangements to manipulate contracts in Greenvale's favor. The court heard that Maylam enjoyed luxury holidays, expensive cars, and extravagant meals at Michelin-starred restaurants as part of the bribes received from Baxter. In addition to these personal benefits, Maylam also received significant cash payments, all of which ultimately contributed to the £5million total in bribes. Prosecutors revealed the detailed and deliberate nature of the men's scheme, exposing the lengths they went to in order to keep their illicit dealings covert. Sainsbury's, which was unaware of the arrangement between Maylam and Baxter, conducted an internal investigation upon discovering the fraud. The supermarket company subsequently ended its contract with Greenvale, citing the corrupt practices as a clear violation of its supplier code of conduct. Sainsbury's has since sought restitution for the £8.7million lost through the overcharging scheme. In passing sentence, the judge condemned the actions of both Maylam and Baxter, emphasizing the considerable financial damage caused to the company and the dishonesty at the heart of their crimes. The judge also acknowledged the personal greed that motivated the defendants and expressed hope that the sentences imposed would serve as a deterrent to others considering similar fraudulent schemes. Following the trial's conclusion, a Sainsbury's spokesperson affirmed the company's commitment to safeguarding against such corruption in the future, stating that it would continue to work diligently to maintain the highest standards of integrity in all of its business dealings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose first venture was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public?, what is it ?

Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, (; 9 May 1860 - 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. James Matthew Barrie was born in Kirriemuir, Angus, to a conservative Calvinist family. His father David Barrie was a modestly successful weaver. His mother Margaret Ogilvy assumed her deceased mother's household responsibilities at the age of eight. Barrie was the ninth child of ten (two of whom died before he was born), all of whom were schooled in at least the three Rs in preparation for possible professional careers. His siblings were: Alexander (1842 - 16 July 1914), Mary Ann (1845-1918), Jane (14 March 1847 - 31 August 1895), Elizabeth (12 March 1849 - 1 April 1851), Agnes (23 Dec 1850 - 1851), David Ogilvy (30 January 1853 - 29 January 1867), Sarah (3 June 1855 -1 November 1913), Isabella (4 January 1858 - 1902) and Margaret (9 July 1863 - 1936). He was a small child and drew attention to himself with storytelling. He only grew to 5 ft 3 1/2 in. (161 cm) according to his 1934 passport. When he was 6 years old, Barrie's next-older brother David (his mother's favourite) died the day before his 14th birthday in an ice-skating accident.This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, \\"Is that you?\\" \\"I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to\\", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) \\"and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me.'\\" Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress. At the age of 8, Barrie was sent to the Glasgow Academy in the care of his eldest siblings Alexander and Mary Ann, who taught at the school. When he was 10, he returned home and continued his education at the Forfar Academy. At 14, he left home for Dumfries Academy, again under the watch of Alexander and Mary Ann. He became a voracious reader, and was fond of Penny Dreadfuls and the works of Robert Michael Ballantyne and James Fenimore Cooper. At Dumfries, he and his friends spent time in the garden of Moat Brae house, playing pirates \\"in a sort of Odyssey that was long afterwards to become the play of Peter Pan\\". They formed a drama club, producing his first play Bandelero the Bandit, which provoked a minor controversy following a scathing moral denunciation from a clergyman on the school's governing board. What happened to David?","completion":"David Ogilvy Barrie, James Matthew Barrie's next-older brother, tragically died in an ice-skating accident. David was the favorite child of their mother, Margaret Ogilvy, and his death came just a day before his 14th birthday, leaving her devastated. In an attempt to fill the void left by David and to gain his mother's attention, James Barrie would wear David's clothes and imitate his mannerisms, such as whistling in the way David did. This loss had a profound effect on both James Barrie and his mother. Margaret found solace in the idea that her deceased son would remain a boy forever, never growing up and leaving her. This notion likely played a significant role in the development of Barrie's most famous creation, Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up. Throughout his life, Barrie's experiences and relationships with his family, particularly the impact of David's death and his mother's subsequent grief, shaped his storytelling and the themes of his literary works."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: What is time-fluid committee? Second question: What epic reason should be there to quit from someone's relationship? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What is time-fluid committee? A time-fluid committee is a conceptual term describing a group or committee that works across different time zones, schedules, or periods. This type of committee can take various forms and is generally characterized by its flexibility in scheduling, communication, and overall structure. The idea behind a time-fluid committee is to enable collaboration and productivity among individuals who may not have the same availability or work within the same time constraints. Key features of a time-fluid committee include: 1. Flexible scheduling: Members of a time-fluid committee are not required to adhere to a rigid schedule or participate in meetings at set times. This allows individuals to collaborate when it is convenient for them, leading to increased participation, engagement, and overall efficiency. 2. Asynchronous communication: Time-fluid committees rely heavily on asynchronous communication, such as email, online forums, and collaborative project management tools. This ensures that important discussions and decision-making processes can take place even if members cannot be present at the same time. 3. Task-based organization: Time-fluid committees often organize their work around specific tasks or deliverables, rather than rigid time-based schedules. This allows members to focus on accomplishing goals in a manner that works best for their individual circumstances. 4. Emphasis on personal accountability: In a time-fluid committee, members are generally expected to take personal responsibility for their contributions and overall productivity. This necessitates a high level of trust and accountability among the group, as well as clear communication of expectations. Second question: What epic reason should be there to quit from someone's relationship? An epic reason to quit a relationship would be a reason that significantly impacts the foundation, dynamics, or overall health of the relationship. While every situation is unique, an epic reason typically falls under one or multiple categories. Here are some examples: 1. Irreconcilable differences: This refers to conflicting ideas, values, or beliefs that are so profound that they create an insurmountable barrier to the relationship. Examples include fundamental disagreements on core life values, lifestyle choices, religion, or parenting styles. 2. Abuse or toxicity: Any form of abuse – physical, emotional, or psychological – is a valid reason to leave a relationship. This includes ongoing patterns of manipulation, control, or toxic behavior that undermines one's mental health, safety, and overall well-being. 3. Betrayal or dishonesty: Trust is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and a significant betrayal or pattern of dishonesty can irreparably damage that trust. Examples include ongoing infidelity, hidden addictions, or purposeful deception regarding crucial aspects of one's life. 4. Incompatibility or lack of fulfillment: Over time, people may change, and it may become evident that the partners are no longer compatible or unable to meet each other's emotional needs. Incompatibility or lack of fulfillment may result from differing visions for the future, emotional disconnect, or other substantial barriers hindering personal growth and happiness. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question pertains to a particular type of committee that operates in a flexible, time-independent manner. The second question focuses on the reasons one might opt to end a relationship, specifically those reasons that are particularly significant or severe in nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building? is inside the article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Step-by-step justification: 1. First, a larva is born, which is the beginning stage of a butterfly or moth's life cycle. 2. The larva, also known as a caterpillar, eats constantly in order to grow bigger and store energy for the upcoming metamorphosis. 3. Once it reaches the appropriate size and development stage, the caterpillar starts to form a cocoon (or chrysalis) around itself, providing a protective shell for the transformation. 4. Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar becomes a pupa, which is the third stage of the life cycle. During this stage, the caterpillar undergoes significant changes, rearranging its cells and structures to develop the features of an adult butterfly or moth. 5. After some time, typically ranging from several days to weeks depending on the species, the cocoon hatches. 6. The final step is the emergence of the fully developed adult butterfly (or moth) from the cocoon.

This magnificent work of art, standing at 17 feet tall (5.17 meters), was completed between 1501 and 1504. Made from a single block of Carrara marble, the sculpture represents the biblical hero David and is considered one of the masterpieces of the High Renaissance period. The city of Florence has a deep connection with the Statue of David, stemming from its historical significance and artistic value. Initially, the statue was commissioned for the Cathedral of Florence, known as \\"Il Duomo,\\" to be part of a series of sculptures placed along its roofline. However, due to its monumental size and weight, the decision was made to install it at ground level instead. In 1504, shortly after its completion, the Statue of David was placed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (now known as Palazzo Vecchio), the seat of civic power in the city at that time. It served as a powerful symbol of the Florentine Republic's resilience and defiance against external threats, particularly in relation to its rival city-states and the ruling Medici family. Over time, exposure to the elements caused deterioration of the marble, leading to the decision to move the statue indoors for preservation. In 1873, the original Statue of David was moved to the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, where it stands today as the gallery's pride and main attraction. A replica of the statue was installed at the original site in Piazza della Signoria to maintain the symbolic connection to the city’s history. Visitors to Florence can admire the original Statue of David at the Galleria dell'Accademia, experiencing the awe-inspiring work of Michelangelo up close. In addition to the Accademia Gallery, there are other replicas to be found in various locations in Florence, such as the one in Piazza della Signoria and another in the outdoor sculpture display at the Piazzale Michelangelo.

With few exceptions, all elements are under command of the Surgeon General for domestic support and force generation, or temporarily assigned under command of a deployed Joint Task Force through Canadian Joint Operations Command.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of military operations and formations, groups of troops sent away on a separate mission are generally called \\"detachments\\" or \\"task forces.\\" These terms can be better understood when broken down and explained with reference to the provided context of the Health Services Group within the Canadian Armed Forces. 1. Detachments: A detachment is a smaller unit of troops temporarily separated from their parent unit to perform a specific mission or duty. In the context of the Health Services Group, detachments are smaller groups of personnel and resources that can be sent to provide medical support and health services to various Canadian Armed Forces operations or domestic support as required. These detachments can consist of general or specialized units, depending on the needs of the mission. Once their assigned tasks are complete, they will typically rejoin their parent unit. 2. Task Forces: A task force, on the other hand, is a temporary formation of units or groups of troops assembled to achieve a specific objective or conduct a joint operation. These task forces are usually composed of different types of units that possess complementary capabilities, enabling them to carry out a wide range of tasks. In the context of the Health Services Group, when a detachment or a specialized unit is assigned under the command of a deployed Joint Task Force through the Canadian Joint Operations Command, it becomes part of a larger formation with a specific mission to accomplish. In summary, groups of troops sent away on a separate mission within the Health Services Group of the Canadian Armed Forces, or any military organization, are commonly referred to as detachments or task forces. Detachments are smaller units temporarily separated from their parent unit for a specific mission, while task forces are temporary formations of various units with complementary capabilities working together to achieve a common objective.

If there are dominant and recessive genes, how can a white/black pair of parents can never have a black/white baby? Why does my best friend have weird eyebrows? On the right side her eyebrows and eyelashes are white but the left side is black. Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"These questions do not have the same meaning, but they are related in the sense that they both involve genetics and inheritance of traits. I will address each question separately. 1. Regarding the pairing between white and black parents: In order to have a child that is either black or white, the parents must both carry the genes for these traits. Skin color is determined by multiple genes, but we can simplify the concept by looking at a single gene that influences pigmentation. The dominant gene (B) may code for darker skin, while the recessive gene (b) may lead to lighter skin. A black parent could have the gene pair (BB) or (Bb), while a white parent would have the gene pair (bb). When a black parent with (BB) genes and a white parent with (bb) genes have a child, the child will inherit one gene from each parent. In this case, the child would inherit (Bb), resulting in them having darker skin, as the dominant gene (B) is expressed. However, since the child carries the recessive (b) gene, they can potentially pass down lighter skin to their offspring if they have a child with a partner who also has a (b) gene. If a black parent has the (Bb) gene pair and a white parent has the (bb) gene pair, there is a 50% chance the child will inherit (Bb) and have darker skin, and a 50% chance the child will have lighter skin (bb). In summary, a white/black pair of parents can have a black/white baby depending on the specific combination of genes they carry and pass down to their children. 2. Regarding your friend's eyebrows: The variation in your friend's eyebrows and eyelashes color could be due to a genetic condition called Waardenburg syndrome. This syndrome affects pigmentation and can cause a person to have patches of lighter hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, as well as different eye colors. Waardenburg syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes and may be inherited. Even if your friend doesn't have Waardenburg syndrome, the different coloration could still be due to genetics. Hair and eyebrow color are determined by the amount and type of pigmentation produced by melanocytes (pigment-producing cells). The pigmentation can be influenced by several genes, so it is possible that your friend inherited a unique combination of genes that created the distinct eyebrow and eyelash coloration. In conclusion, these questions are related to genetics and inheritance, but they address two different topics: skin color in offspring resulting from mixed relationships and the unique pigmentation of a person's eyebrows/eyelashes."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Choices: [I] Yes; [II] No; A:","completion":"II No; While \\"humbled\\" can be considered as one of the potential emotions that Jan might feel, it is not the most valid or likely answer for this situation. The term \\"humbled\\" usually indicates a sense of modesty or respect that arises from recognizing the greatness or accomplishments of others, or from reflecting upon one's own weaknesses or shortcomings. In this scenario, Jan has successfully managed to diet and fit into the wedding dress that was initially too small. Therefore, they have likely overcome an obstacle and achieved their goal due to their determination and perseverance. In this case, some possible emotions Jan might experience include: 1. Pride: Jan could feel a sense of pride as they have managed to put in the effort to diet and reach their objective of fitting into the wedding dress. 2. Happiness: Achieving their goal, Jan may feel happy that they can wear their desired wedding dress, leading to joy and satisfaction in choosing their perfect attire for the special day. 3. Relief: After months of dedication, Jan may feel relieved that their hard work and sacrifices have paid off, and they can finally wear the wedding dress they desired. 4.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw for a career second-best 466 yards, as he completed 38 of 59 pass attempts with three touchdown throws, as the Patriots were able to hold off a late Buffalo Bills rally thanks to their high-octane offense, giving the Patriots their first divisional win of the season. The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19. The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins. Brady kneeled on the ensuing drive, securing the 40-32 win. The Bills' fans failed to set the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd noise.

Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home to save money on energy and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health. Which friend spent less time breathing fresh air? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Fay spent less time breathing fresh air compared to Patty. Though both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution, their lifestyles played a significant role in determining their exposure to fresh air. Patty, being an outdoor enthusiast who enjoyed running and hiking, spent much more time outside. This allowed her to breathe in the fresh air when she was in less polluted areas, such as parks, trails, or other natural settings away from the sources of air pollution commonly found in urban and industrial zones. Her outdoor activities also promoted better blood circulation and overall health, further improving her body's ability to combat any potential ill effects of air pollution. On the other hand, Fay chose to seal up her home in order to save money on energy. As a result, she spent most of her time indoors. While this decision may have reduced her energy consumption, it also limited the amount of fresh air that could enter her home. Indoor air pollution can come from various sources such as cooking, cleaning products, pets, mold, and even outdoor air pollution that enters the home. Being indoors most of the time, Fay was more susceptible to the harmful effects of indoor air pollutants. Furthermore, her limited time outdoors meant that she had fewer opportunities to breathe in cleaner, fresher air. It is important to note that while spending time outdoors can provide Patty with better access to fresh air, she still lived in an area with moderate to high air pollution. Therefore, it is crucial for both friends to be mindful of the air quality and take necessary precautions such as avoiding outdoor activities during times of high pollution, using air purifiers at home or keeping indoor environments well-ventilated. In conclusion, although both Patty and Fay lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution, Patty spent more time breathing fresh air due to her outdoor activities, as compared to Fay who spent most of her time indoors with a sealed home. Nevertheless, both friends should remain cautious and attentive to the air quality in their environment to minimize the impact of pollution on their health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a news article: In the weeks following her father’s inauguration, Ivanka Trump quietly reached out to the president of Planned Parenthood seeking common ground on the contentious issue of abortion. The first daughter requested a sit-down with Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood and a vocal surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the 2016 campaign trail, to talk about an organization that is being targeted by Republicans seeking to defund it because it provides abortions, among other women’s health services like cancer screenings. Story Continued Below Their under-the-radar meeting — a rarity between a well-known Democratic activist and a close adviser to a Republican president — has not been previously reported. “The purpose of the meeting, from Cecile’s point of view, was to make sure that Ivanka fully understood what Planned Parenthood does, how it is funded, and why it would be a terrible idea for Planned Parenthood to be removed from being able to see Medicaid patients,” said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “The main thing that Cecile Richards was doing was explaining that the money doesn’t actually go to abortions — we get reimbursed the same way a hospital does. We were clearing up misinformation about how this works.” Richards also shares a unique perspective with Ivanka Trump: She, too, is a political daughter (her mother was former Texas Gov. Ann Richards) with big personal ambitions focused on fighting for women's empowerment. Laguens called it “an explainer meeting” and said that Ivanka Trump had expressed an interest in wanting “to know more about the facts of Planned Parenthood.” Ivanka Trump has been on a listening tour since moving to Washington, as she stakes a claim on women's issues. In addition to her meeting with Richards, she has quietly met with other leaders of the progressive women’s movement, including Marcia Greenberger, co-president the National Women's Law Center, and Judy Lichtman, senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Family, sources familiar with the meetings told POLITICO. But the strategic outreach hasn’t seemed to earn Ivanka Trump much public goodwill. Since Ivanka Trump’s sit-down with Richards, what started as a cordial relationship has soured — and any effort on the part of the politically savvy first daughter to back-channel to the nonprofit has transformed into a bitter battle since Ivanka Trump assumed an official administration post. Richards, fighting the Trump administration, has publicly rebuked Ivanka Trump for her “deafening” silence on the GOP health care bill. On Wednesday night, Richards again took aim at the first daughter, now a senior White House official with a security clearance and an office in the West Wing. “Anyone who works in this White House is responsible for addressing why women are in the cross hairs of basically every single policy we've seen in this administration,” Richards said, speaking at the Women in the World conference in New York City. The public lashing of Ivanka Trump stems from a sense, among Planned Parenthood advocates, that as someone who has staked her reputation on fighting for women’s economic empowerment, Ivanka Trump must be held accountable for her silence. “You don’t get to have it both ways,” Laguens said. “You don’t get to say, I’m all for economic empowerment, and ignore that 30 percent of wage gains are directly attributable to access to birth control. You don’t get to say women should have great child care when maternity benefits are on the chopping block.” Last month, Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 vote in the Senate to roll back a rule that barred states from denying family planning grants to Planned Parenthood. Ivanka Trump did not weigh in. Ivanka Trump declined to comment for this story. In an interview with Gayle King that aired on CBS Wednesday morning, Ivanka Trump defended her role both as a champion of women and as someone who is choosing to stay away from the public fight to defund Planned Parenthood. “I would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,” she said. “I think there are multiple ways to have your voice heard. In some cases, it’s through protest and it’s through going on the nightly news and talking about or denouncing every issue on which you disagree with. Other times, it is quietly and directly and candidly. So where I disagree with my father, he knows it.” Planned Parenthood, which receives about 550 million in federal funding annually, has been a stumbling block for Ivanka Trump — one that advocates on the left have set up as a test of her commitment to fighting for women’s rights, and that her defenders argue is an unfair albatross. The New York Times reported last month that the White House had pitched the organization on a plan that would please the conservative base while seeking common ground with Democrats — allowing it to retain its federal payments if it stopped providing abortions. But that was an immediate non-starter for the group. In her interview with King, Ivanka Trump defended her position, arguing that she is playing a long game, and that speaking out on issues where she doesn’t see a win won’t help her be effective in the White House. “I’ll take hits from some critics who say that I should take to the street,” she said. “And then other people will, in the long term, respect where I get to. But I think most of the impact I have, over time, most people will not actually know about.” She has also noted that the line item for women’s health increased in the Trump administration’s proposed budget. The attacks lobbed at her from Planned Parenthood executives are seen by people close to Ivanka Trump as misguided: Even if she were publicly engaged, Ivanka Trump would not be able to sway a Republican House and Senate on the issue. The thinking is that no amount of advocacy on her part, when it comes to sticking up for a group that has long symbolized the fight against a woman’s right to choose, could help.

President Donald Trump has been more open to Planned Parenthood than many of the lawmakers who control the levers of funding — a sign that it is not his viewpoint, the one over which Ivanka Trump holds the most sway, that needs to be changed. “Millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood,” Trump said during a presidential debate in February 2016. “I would defund it because I’m pro-life, but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.” And in the past, Trump had also supported abortion rights. ||||| The president's daughter has responded to criticism about her brought up in a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch -- because this is politics in 2017. However, Ivanka Trump's reply to a question asking if she is \\"complicit\\" in her dad's presidency has confused everyone. It has even led some to believe the first lady daughter doesn't actually know what the word means -- so clearly, she hasn't been keeping up with \\"SNL.\\" REUTERS In an interview with CBS's's Gayle King, her first since Donald Trump became president, Ivanka said, I don't know what it means to be complicit, but you know, I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and much more importantly that my father's administration is the success that I know it will be. I mean, she even said herself she doesn't know what it means. Luckily for Ivanka, she's been given a helping hand by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, who waded into the debate on Twitter and defined it as \\"helping to commit a crime or do wrong in some way.\\" Twitter In the interview, the newly appointed assistant to the president said, If being complicit is wanting to, is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I'm complicit. I don't know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that I am now in, would do any differently than I am doing. The interview took place weeks after Scarlett Johansson played Ivanka in an \\"SNL\\" sketch advertising her new perfume, \\"Complicit.\\" Saturday Night Live on YouTube Ivanka regularly speaks out about women's issues, but despite that, she has been criticized for failing to denounce the alleged sexism of the Trump presidency. Some have labeled her complicit for not intervening with his controversial policies that attack women. Most recently, eyebrows were raised when she tweeted to celebrate Equal Pay Day just days after the president removed protections for women in the workplace brought in under Barack Obama.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. It is important to discuss feelings with your toddler. Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations. You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.” It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways. If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.” Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure. Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow. Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child. Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage. Summary:","completion":"Discussing feelings with your toddler is crucial for their emotional development and learning how to express themselves. As they begin to understand and associate words with certain emotions, they can later use those words to communicate effectively. Observing and understanding your toddler's feelings helps you to guide them in expressing their emotions in a more constructive manner. Setting firm limits and boundaries while explaining the reasoning behind them instills a sense of security in your child. Focus on the positive aspects of rules, highlighting the benefits, and encourage your toddler to socialize with other children. Although parallel play is common during this stage, supporting them in building friendships and interacting with others is essential for their social development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the United States, and more recently also in Britain, the term \\"student\\" is applied to both categories. In its widest use, \\"student\\" is used for anyone who is learning, including mid-career adults who are taking vocational education or returning to university. When speaking about learning outside an institution, \\"student\\" is also used to refer to someone who is learning a topic or who is \\"a student of\\" a certain topic or person. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Miami University (also referred to as Miami U, Miami of Ohio, Miami University, Ohio, or simply Miami) is a coeducational public research university located in Oxford, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1809, although classes were not held until 1824, it is the 10th oldest public university in the United States and the second oldest university in Ohio. In its 2017 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked the university 79th among national universities, the 30th top public school, and 2nd (1st among public institutions) for best undergraduate teaching at national universities. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - George Mason (sometimes referred to as George Mason IV; October 7, 1792) was a Virginia planter and politician, and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, one of three delegates who refused to sign the constitution. His writings have been a significant influence on political thought and events, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and his \\"Objections to this Constitution of Government\\" (1787) in opposition to ratification of the constitution. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed the father. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is a nonprofit, non-governmental institution (Not to be confused with Islamic State - ISIS) to inform the public about \\"science and policy issues affecting international security.\\" Founded in 1993, the group is led by founder and former United Nations IAEA nuclear inspector David Albright. ISIS was founded on a belief that scientists have an obligation to participate actively in solving major problems of national and international security. ISIS focuses primarily on four parts: 1) prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology to other nations and terrorists, 2) lead to greater transparency of nuclear activities worldwide, 3) reinforce the international non-proliferation regime, and 4) cut down nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, ISIS seeks to build stable foundations for various efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons to U.S. and international security by integrating technical, scientific and policy research. As the effectiveness of ISIS was appreciated and recognized in the Global Go-To Think Tanks rankings, ISIS consistently places in the top 25 Science and Technology Think Tanks in the world and in 2015 placed as one of the top United States and foreign policy think tanks in the world. - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances. - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. - Wright State University is a public research university in Fairborn, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. Originally operating as a branch campus for Ohio State University and Miami University, Wright State became an independent institution in 1967. Its name honors the aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright, who were residents of Dayton. In 1969, a branch campus opened on the shore of Grand Lake St. Marys in Celina, Ohio. The university offers degrees at the bachelors, masters, and doctoral level. - The Ohio State University, commonly referred to as Ohio State or OSU, is a public university in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862, the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mech). The college began with a focus on training students in various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but was developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to \\"The Ohio State University\\". It has since grown into the third-largest university campus in the United States. Along with its main campus in Columbus, Ohio State also operates a regional campus system with regional campuses in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, Newark, and Wooster. - Purdue University is a public research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana and is the main campus of the Purdue University system. The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stagescreenwriting and playwrightingare often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well. - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - George Mason University (also Mason), located in Fairfax, Virginia, United States, is the largest public research university in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The university was founded as a branch of the University of Virginia in 1957 and became an independent institution in 1972. Today, Mason is recognized for its programs in economics, law, creative writing, computer science, and business. In recent years, George Mason faculty have twice won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The university enrolls 33,917 students, making it the largest university by head count in the Commonwealth of Virginia. - David Albright , M.Sc. , is the founder of the non-governmental Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , its current president , and author of several books on proliferation of atomic weapons . Albright holds a Master of Science in physics from Indiana University and a M.Sc . in mathematics from Wright State University . He has taught physics at George Mason University in Virginia . From 1990 to 2001 , Albright was a member of the Colorado State Health Advisory Panel , participating in its assessment of the toxicological and radiological effects on the population near the Rocky Flats atomic weapons production site . 1992 -- 97 , David Albright was associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Action Team . In June 1996 , he was invited to be the first non-governmental inspector of Iraq 's nuclear program and questioned Iraqi officials about that country 's uranium enrichment program . In 2001 Albright prepared an analysis , for CNN , of documents found in an abandoned Al Qaeda safe house in Kabul believed to have been used by Abu Khabbab , who they described as \`\` Osama bin Laden 's top chemical and biological weapons commander . '' Albright confirmed the abandoned documents included plans for a nuclear bomb , and extensive training notes on the handling of radiological material . In September 2002 , Albright and his organization ISIS were the first to publicly criticize the claims of the Bush administration and the CIA about the infamous Iraqi aluminum tubes . In response to Iraqi aluminum tubes , Albright said it was far from clear that the tubes were intended for a uranium centrifuge .

In some contexts, the word \\"thesis\\" or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while \\"dissertation\\" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in other contexts, the reverse is true. The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations. - The University of Virginia (U.Va. or UVA), frequently referred to simply as Virginia, is a public flagship and research university. Founded in 1819 by Declaration of Independence author Thomas Jefferson, UVA is known for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies. - Indiana UniversityPurdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is a public research university located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Belonging to the university systems of both Indiana University and Purdue University, it is the result of a merger in 1969 of the Purdue Indianapolis Extension Center (1946) and Indiana University Indianapolis (1916). Located along the White River and Fall Creek it sits upon a peninsula adjacent to Downtown Indianapolis. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - A Master of Science degree (abbreviated MS, MSc, MSci, ScM or SciM with or without punctuation) is a type of master's degree awarded by universities in many countries. The degree is usually contrasted with the Master of Arts degree. The Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering, and medicine, and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a thesis. - Indiana University Bloomington (abbreviated \\"IU Bloomington\\" and colloquially referred to as \\"IU\\" or simply \\"Indiana\\") is a public research university located in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. With over 48,000 students, IU Bloomington is the flagship institution of the Indiana University system and its largest university. - International security, also called global security, refers to the amalgamation of measures taken by states and international organizations, such as the United Nations, European Union, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and others, to ensure mutual survival and safety. These measures include military action and diplomatic agreements such as treaties and conventions. International and national security are invariably linked. International security is national security or state security in the global arena. - Indiana University (IU) is a multi-campus public university system in the state of Indiana, United States.

Emily Pitt got her head wedged in her older brother's training seat after trying it on as a hat. Her mother, Sarah Pitt, at first laughed when her young daughter wandered into the living room with the seat around her neck - but then had to ring 999 when she was unable to get it off. Emily Pitt had to be freed by firefighters after she got her head wedged in her older brother's training seat. Ms Pitt, 35, said: 'I thought they would just give me advice on how to get it off - we spent 45 minutes trying to get it off and she was wedged in tight. 'We had to show her Peppa Pig on my iPhone to keep her quiet. The fire brigade showed up and carefully cut her free - I'm so grateful to them. 'Emily now keeps talking about how the firemen came and rescued her.'

Two Indiana girls  one 16, one 15  took racy photos of themselves at a slumber party and posted them online. When their high school found out, it suspended the girls from participating in a certain amount of their extracurricular activities. Can the school legally do that? A federal district court in Fort Wayne, Ind., recently ruled that it cannot  because the punishment violated the girls' First Amendment rights. The legal question of what rights students have to post provocative material on the Internet, and what rights schools have to restrict such postings, is still unsettled. But the Indiana decision is the second important ruling in recent months to strike a blow for students' online speech rights. (See the top 10 people caught on Facebook.) The two Indiana 10th-graders  whose names have not been released  engaged in a variety of crude activities at a slumber party in the summer of 2009. Among other things, they posed with toys in sexually suggestive ways and sucked on phallic-shaped lollipops. It is hardly shocking that teenagers at a sleepover party would engage in raunchy behavior. Thanks to the Internet, however, activity that once remained behind closed bedroom doors can now be broadcast to a limited group of friends  or a worldwide audience. (See top 10 things you shouldn't do on Facebook.) One of the girls posted some of the photos on her MySpace and Facebook accounts, where they could be seen by people who had \\"friend\\" status. Some of the lollipop photos were posted on a photo-sharing website, where a password was necessary to see them. The postings did not identify the girls as students of Churubusco High School, the public school they attended outside of Fort Wayne. Nor did the girls ever take the photographs on campus. But the photos came to the attention of a school parent, who complained to the local superintendent. The parent said the photos were causing divisiveness on the school's volleyball team, of which the two girls were both members, and that the team was breaking down into a camp that supported the photos and one that did not. The principal decided that the girls had violated the school's athletic code, which prohibits students from engaging in conduct that \\"brings discredit or dishonor\\" on themselves or the school. To punish them, he imposed a partial suspension from volleyball. The girls, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, sued, alleging that the suspensions violated their free-speech rights. The school stood its ground, and argued that the girls' provocative posing was not protected free expression. The federal district court took a dim view of the girls' activities. It began its opinion by saying: \\"Not much good takes place at slumber parties for high school kids, and this case proves the point.\\" It also acknowledged that the racy photographs at stake in the case were hardly the loftiest sort of communication. (Read why students have a right to mock teachers online.) In previous school-speech cases, students have fought for the right to wear black armbands to oppose the Vietnam War, or to publish exposés in school newspapers. The expression at issue here, the court said, was by comparison \\"juvenile and silly.\\" Still, it was expression  and worthy of First Amendment protection. Yet the fact that it was judged to be protected speech did not end the matter. In student-speech cases, courts have tried to balance students' rights against schools' need for discipline. The standard they apply, based on the 1969 Supreme Court case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (the case involving the black armbands) is that schools can only restrict student expression when that expression would \\"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.\\" The girls' racy photographs, the Indiana court rightly held, do not rise to the level of \\"substantial disruption.\\" The \\"petty disagreements\\" on the volleyball team were \\"utterly routine,\\" the court said, and not the sort of problem that justified infringing on student-speech rights. The Indiana ruling follows a June decision from the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals in J.S. v. Blue Mountain School District, which held that a student could not be disciplined for posting a crude parody of her middle-school principal on MySpace. In that case, the court said that even if the parody was offensive  it presented the principal as a bisexual named M-Hoe with a sexual addiction and a child who looked like a gorilla  there was no reason to believe it would cause substantial disruption. Taken together, the back-to-back Indiana and Pennsylvania rulings suggest two things. First, with the rise of the Internet, students are posting a lot of \\"crass foolishness,\\" as the Indiana court tartly put it. And second, that courts are correctly determining that, except in the most extraordinary cases, students have a constitutional right to do so.

Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls? Options: A: They have a new fashion B: They have better quality.
