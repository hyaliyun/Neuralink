The trio of golf superstars will undoubtedly make for an exciting opening in one of golf's oldest and most revered tournaments. Background on the Open Championship The Open Championship, also known as The British Open or simply The Open, is the oldest of the four major professional golf championships. First held in 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland, the event has grown into one of the most coveted titles in the golfing world. Played on a rotational basis across a selection of links courses in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, this major event offers a unique challenge to players due to its demanding course conditions and unpredictable weather patterns. Danny Willett's Rise to Fame Hailing from Sheffield, England, 28-year-old Danny Willett earned his breakthrough moment after clinching the green jacket at the 2016 Masters Tournament. This victory not only marked his first major championship, but also made him the first English golfer to win at Augusta National since Nick Faldo in 1996. Willett's immense talent and hardworking attitude have swiftly cemented his place amongst golf's elite and made him a fan favorite in his home country. Jason Day's Reign as World Number One Australian golf sensation Jason Day currently holds the coveted title of world number one, a position he first achieved in September 2015 after winning the BMW Championship. Today, Day has racked up a total of 12 PGA Tour titles, including his triumph at the 2015 PGA Championship. As a result, the 29-year-old Australian has established himself as a dominant force in men's golf, with an impressive record at the major championships and a burning desire to solidify his legacy. Rickie Fowler's Journey to Excellence A native of California, 28-year-old Rickie Fowler has been a consistent presence at the top of world golf for several years now. Bursting onto the scene in 2010 as the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, Fowler has since captured four PGA Tour titles and six international victories. The charismatic golfer also notably captured the prestigious Players Championship in 2015. Although Fowler is yet to clinch his first major championship, his talent and dedication make him a serious contender at every event in which he participates. The Showdown at the 145th Open Championship With the stage set for an exhilarating first two rounds at the 145th Open Championship, golf enthusiasts can expect to witness some captivating golf from this trio of world-class players. Willett will be aiming to claim another major title on home soil, while Day looks to continue his reign as world number one and capture the coveted Claret Jug. Meanwhile, Fowler seeks to prove himself as a major champion and capture his first major title. One thing is for sure – the opening rounds of the 145th Open Championship will offer a thrilling display of skill, determination, and sportsmanship from three of golf's premier talents. As Willett, Day, and Fowler vie for the prestigious title, millions of golf fans worldwide eagerly await the chance to witness these formidable competitors in action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: be happy the murderer was convicted, not commended, praised for their hard work The answer is:","completion":"To determine the best answer, let's analyze each of the possible answers step by step: 1. Be happy the murderer was convicted: This is a possible emotional outcome for Lee, as he successfully concluded the high-profile murder case. It is a natural reaction for a professional to feel content with achieving a positive result in their work. However, it doesn't entirely encapsulate everything that might happen to Lee in the context provided. 2.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. John Laurens (October 28, 1754 – August 27, 1782) was an American soldier and statesman from South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, best known for his criticism of slavery and efforts to help recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Laurens wrote thesis against slavery","completion":"Yes, the sentence does follow, given the preceding text about John Laurens. As an American soldier and statesman, Laurens was known for his criticism of slavery and efforts to encourage slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers. This demonstrates that he held strong anti-slavery beliefs, and it would be reasonable to assume that he may have expressed these beliefs through written work, such as a thesis against slavery. John Laurens was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to a prominent slaveholding family. His father, Henry Laurens, was a wealthy plantation owner and merchant, as well as a leading figure in the American revolutionary movement. Despite his upbringing, John chose to pursue a different path and became a staunch abolitionist. He was educated in Europe, where his exposure to Enlightenment ideas likely contributed to his anti-slavery stance. In 1779, Laurens proposed a plan to the Continental Congress that would grant freedom to enslaved individuals who were willing to fight for the American cause. His proposal, known as the “Black Battalion Plan,” aimed to address the shortage of troops within the Continental Army and, at the same time, undermine Britain's labor-intensive plantation economy in the American South. Unfortunately, his proposal was met with strong opposition from Southern delegates, and it was ultimately rejected. Although the details of the thesis Laurens wrote against slavery are not provided in the initial sentence, it can be reasonably inferred that his written work would have reflected his abolitionist beliefs. His thesis likely presented arguments in opposition to the institution of slavery and may have proposed solutions for dismantling it. Furthermore, the fact that Laurens actively sought to recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers adds credibility to the idea that he would have also written a thesis against slavery. In conclusion, given John Laurens' known criticism of slavery and his efforts to help recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers, it does follow that he would have written a thesis against slavery. His anti-slavery activism was deeply rooted in his personal beliefs and endeavors, and expressing these convictions through a written work would have been a natural extension of his overall mission to challenge and confront the injustices of slavery."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please capitalize where necessary: for high percentage of mature parasites, use cultures with an initial parasitaemia of ≥10%.","completion":"For high percentage of mature parasites, use cultures with an initial parasitaemia of ≥10%. When maintaining cultures for the purpose of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites, it is important to ensure that the initial parasitaemia is at least 10%. This value signifies the percentage of red blood cells that are infected with the target parasite, such as Plasmodium species in the context of malaria research. By starting with a higher parasitaemia, researchers can increase the likelihood of observing mature forms of the parasite, such as schizonts and gametocytes, which are essential for studying their biology and developing targeted interventions. If the initial parasitaemia is less than 10%, the chances of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites decrease, as the culture may not provide a sufficient number of infection events for the parasites to undergo their developmental stages. In this scenario, immature forms, such as rings and trophozoites, may predominate, skewing the data and potentially affecting the interpretation of experimental results. To maximize the opportunity to observe mature parasites, researchers should also consider additional factors when setting up the culture, such as: 1. The age and quality of the red blood cells: Fresh and well-preserved red blood cells can enhance parasite growth and maturation. It is advisable to use blood samples that have been stored for no longer than two weeks and to ensure that they have been handled and stored appropriately. 2. The culture medium: A suitable culture medium, containing essential nutrients and appropriate buffers, will promote the growth and development of the parasites. Additionally, supplementation with human serum or serum substitutes can provide further support for parasite maturation. 3. The gas mixture: Plasmodium species require a low-oxygen environment for optimal growth. Maintaining a controlled gas mixture with appropriate levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen is essential for in vitro culture success. By capitalizing on these optimization strategies and ensuring that the initial parasitaemia is at least 10%, researchers can increase their likelihood of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites for their studies."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ferdinand died in January 1516 and was succeeded by his mentally unstable daughter Joanna. Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres. In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile. There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices. In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died. Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors. Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election. The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile. Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg.

Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria, with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time. Before he left Maria for the final time to go back into battle, Tom was told that she was pregnant and was going to keep the baby. He would never see her or the child again. When an expected inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable mansion, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, Tom applies for an opening in public relations at television network UBC. Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he refuses. Hired nonetheless, he helps network president Ralph Hopkins launch a national mental health campaign. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected, but unbeknownst to his employees, his workaholic habits have caused him to be estranged from his wife and his rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who refuses to write their autobiography as part of the interview process?

What colour is the mineral Lapis Lazuli?","completion":"Lapis Lazuli is a vibrant blue mineral with a rich and striking color. This beautiful gemstone has been highly appreciated since ancient times for its vivid hue, and it continues to be a sought-after material for various applications, including jewelry, decorative items, and pigments. The characteristic blue color of Lapis Lazuli can range from deep, dark blue to a lighter, more muted shade, often exhibiting shades of azure or ultramarine. This variation in color arises from the presence of the mineral lazurite, which is mainly responsible for the vibrant blue coloration. Lazurite is a complex sulfate mineral composed of sodium, calcium, aluminum, and sulfur. The specific concentration and distribution of lazurite within the Lapis Lazuli matrix determine the intensity and uniformity of the blue color. In addition to the dominant blue hue, Lapis Lazuli often contains other minerals that create a unique and beautiful visual complexity. For example, white calcite veins can be observed running through the stone, creating a marbled appearance. Moreover, the presence of golden Pyrite inclusions (iron sulfide) adds a sparkling quality to the gemstone, enhancing its visual appeal. It is important to highlight that the quality of Lapis Lazuli can vary greatly depending on its composition, geological origin, and mining conditions, all of which can affect the stone's color and texture. The finest quality stones possess an even, intense blue hue with minimal visible white calcite and a dusting of golden Pyrite inclusions, giving the stone a luxurious and captivating appearance. Stones with more calcite tend to be lighter, and those with more lazurite have a richer blue color. In summary, Lapis Lazuli is a visually striking mineral known for its rich and vibrant blue color, which results from the presence of lazurite in the stone. The specific shade of blue can vary from deep, dark blue to lighter azure shades, with the color's intensity and texture further influenced by the presence of other minerals such as calcite and Pyrite. As a result, Lapis Lazuli has been highly valued for thousands of years for its unique beauty and is still widely used today as a gemstone, decorative material, and pigment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nice sweatshirt!” I was passing through the hallways of school last year, being messenger boy for the teachers, when this girl walked up to me.

I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike?

We have this equation: -165*h = -130*h + 35. Our goal is to find the value of h. Here is what we do: 1. Look at -165*h and -130*h. We will put the h parts together. To do this, we will add the opposite of -130*h to both sides. This means we'll add 130*h to both sides. So our equation will look like this: -165*h +130*h = -130*h + 130*h + 35 2. Now let's find what is -165*h + 130*h. Since they both have 'h', we can combine them. -165 plus 130 equals -35. So our equation becomes: -35*h = 35 3. To find the value of h, we need to get rid of -35 that's with h. We can do this by dividing both sides by -35. This means we'll have: (-35*h)/(-35) = 35/(-35) 4. When we divide, -35 and -35 on the left side will cancel out and we're left with: h = 35/(-35) 5. And when we divide 35 by -35, we get -1. So: h = -1 So the value of h is -1.

On the Origin of Species: By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress.

Emily's hair was recently dyed to get the gray out, but Erin has never had grays, so","completion":"she couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. The two sisters had always been very different, with Erin being the carefree and spontaneous one while Emily tended to worry about every little thing. It wasn't just their personalities that diverged; even their appearances were like night and day. Erin was a natural blonde with long, wavy hair and blue eyes, whereas Emily had always been a brunette with straight, chestnut locks and brown eyes. The hair dying incident wasn't the first time they'd had conversations about aging and appearance. As they entered their late thirties and began to approach their fortieth birthdays, time seemed to be putting its marks on them even further. Erin's face remained relatively unmarked, but Emily's worry lines were becoming more pronounced. Erin, always out to enjoy herself, delved into every new experience with gusto. She saw aging as an opportunity to grow, to become wiser, and to enjoy life's different phases. When she started seeing fine lines around her eyes, she took it as a sign of the constant laughter and joy that had filled her life. She was never shy to share her opinion with Emily, who was much harder on herself when it came to beauty and aging. Their conversation on that sunny afternoon took place in Emily's brand-new house, which she had designed with her husband, Mark. It was a beautiful colonial-style home with white columns and large windows overlooking the lush green backyard. Emily had always been a fan of interior design, and her home was a testament to her impeccable taste and attention to detail. Erin, on the other hand, had settled into a cozy beach bungalow that suited her free-spirited nature. Sitting in the beautifully decorated living room, Emily couldn't help but complain to Erin about the trials of aging. She bemoaned the gray hairs and wrinkles, wishing she could turn back time. Erin, ever the optimist, urged Emily to embrace the changes with grace. She pointed out the positive aspects of growing older, like their expanding families, successful careers, and the wealth of experiences and wisdom they had accumulated over the years. Despite her sister's enthusiasm, Emily remained unconvinced. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing something of value by growing older, and she wondered why Erin seemed immune to these insecurities. One evening, after another fruitless conversation with Erin about the importance of acceptance, Emily confided in her husband about her worries. To her surprise, Mark gently reminded her of how beautiful she was and expressed his love and attraction towards her, no matter their age. He shared his admiration for the way her face lit up when she laughed or when she lost herself in deep thought. He confessed that he had fallen in love with her for her soul, her intelligence, her wit, and her warmth, not just her youthful appearance. Inspired by her husband's perspective, Emily finally began to understand Erin's point of view. She started pondering the idea that beauty could go beyond just her physical appearance and that there was something timeless, more meaningful in her experiences, the love of her family, and the comfort of her marriage. As the days and weeks passed, Emily began to embrace this new outlook gradually. When she looked in the mirror, she no longer saw just the gray hairs and wrinkles but a woman who had grown and evolved over time, becoming even stronger and more remarkable in the process. Thanks to Erin and Mark, Emily had learned that true beauty lay in her relationships, experiences, and resilience, something that no wrinkle or gray hair could ever take away."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - PTS-DOS is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his \\"Riftwar\\" novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A-10 Tank Killer is a flight simulation computer game for Amiga and DOS platforms developed and published by Dynamix. The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft. The game was originally released for DOS in 1989 and for Amiga in 1990. Following the success of \\"Red Baron\\", version 1.5 was released in 1991 which included Gulf War missions and improved graphics and sounds. Several mission packs were sold separately. A sequel published by Sierra, \\"\\", was released in 1996. - Silent Thunder : A- 10 Tank Killer II is a flight simulation computer game and the sequel to A- 10 Tank Killer , which was directed by Frank Evers ( CEO ) . Both games were made by Dynamix and Sierra produced Silent Thunder . It was made for Amiga and DOS platforms . In the game , the player takes the role of an American A- 10 Thunderbolt II aircraft pilot who fights in various campaigns across the world in order to keep the peace . The player character is Jack \`\` Loudmouth '' Haggart , a hotshot American pilot trying to make a name for himself in the U.S. Air Force . He starts off as a rookie pilot who steadily rises through the ranks with each military campaign he successfully completes . He takes orders from Commander Garrett , an unseen American officer who informs Haggart of his primary mission objectives . If Haggart completes a mission successfully , Garrett will praise Haggart for his efforts . However , if Haggart fails a mission , Garrett will lose his temper and either criticize or threaten Haggart . Battlefield intelligence is relayed to Haggart by an unnamed intelligence officer . Finally , there is Nightflight , another A- 10 pilot who is a good friend of Haggart 's . He plays a vital role in the first campaign of the game . There are few other Allied or enemy characters described in great detail throughout the game . - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS. - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - Dynamix, Inc. was an American developer of video games from 1984 to 2001, best known for the flight simulator \\"Red Baron\\", the puzzle game \\"The Incredible Machine\\", the \\"Front Page Sports\\" series, the acclaimed \\"Betrayal at Krondor,\\" and their online multiplayer game \\"Tribes\\".

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work.

Answer:","completion":"Aaron Montgomery Ward, born on February 17, 1844, in Chatham, New Jersey, was a well-known American entrepreneur and businessman. As the image amward.jpg indicates, he was a distinguished individual in his time. Ward commenced his career by working in various industries, including dry goods, farming, and railroads. Through these experiences, he gained valuable knowledge and skills that would later contribute to his business endeavors. His unique vision and innovative ideas led him to establish the first-ever mail-order business, Montgomery Ward & Company, in 1872. During his time, retail stores were primarily available in urban areas, making it difficult for rural customers to access goods. Aaron Montgomery Ward recognized this gap in the market and aimed to provide a convenient solution. By creating a mail-order catalog, he brought goods directly to the homes of rural Americans, revolutionizing the retail landscape. Montgomery Ward's success laid the foundation for future mail-order businesses and transformed the way goods were consumed and distributed across America. Not only did his company break barriers for rural customers, but it also provided an opportunity for new businesses to thrive within the growing industry.

Question: Paulie finds what wounded animal while jogging? Movie title: Lost and Delirious Movie plot: When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Pauline (nicknamed Paulie) and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, \\"He liked my tits.\\" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, \\"And have all those gross guys groping me?

However, things take a turn when Tori's sister, Allison, visits the school and sees Paulie and Tori in an intimate moment. Afraid of how her family will react and the potential consequences of being exposed, Tori decides to distance herself from Paulie and begins dating Jake to convince her family, classmates, and herself that she is actually straight. As Paulie's love for Tori remains intense and undimmed, her emotional state suffers greatly from Tori's rejection. She starts acting out in increasingly dangerous ways, fueled by both her anguish from the heartbreak and her passionate love for Tori. This includes challenging one of the boys from the nearby school to a fencing duel, resulting in her suspension from school. During this time, Paulie continues to care for her wounded falcon, projecting her own feelings of pain and isolation onto the bird and finding solace in their shared loneliness. The falcon can be seen as a metaphor for both Paulie's character and the relationship between Paulie and Tori - fierce, wild, and beautiful, but also fragile and unable to fully heal from its wounds. Mary becomes increasingly worried about Paulie as her mental health deteriorates, and she tries to offer support and help her friend regain a sense of stability. Meanwhile, Tori struggles with her feelings and identity but continues to date Jake to maintain appearances. As tensions rise between all three girls, and Paulie's erratic behavior becomes more alarming, a confrontation occurs that leads to tragedy and heartbreak.

Here is a question about this article: The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, \\"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought.\\" Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \\"personal Napoleonic one\\".

Answer:","completion":"Erin was more unfamiliar with France compared to Rebecca because Rebecca visited many times before, developing a deep understanding and appreciation for the culture, history, and language of the country. Over the years, Rebecca had immersed herself in the French way of life, frequenting local cafés, attending cultural events, and building friendships with many French people. As a result, her knowledge and familiarity with the country grew significantly. On the other hand, Erin had not been as fortunate in terms of travel opportunities and had not managed to visit France as often as she would have liked. Consequently, her understanding of the country was more limited, based mainly on what she had read in books or seen in the media rather than on personal experiences. Erin often found herself grappling with the language barrier and adapting to local customs and practices that were different from her own, which made her feel more like a foreigner in an unknown land. Despite these differences in familiarity, both Erin and Rebecca shared a genuine interest in learning about France and its rich and diverse heritage. Erin was eager to improve her French language skills and gain more insight into the country's history and traditions, while Rebecca continued to delve deeper into her passion for the French lifestyle and sought to discover even more hidden treasures in her favorite country. As their friendship grew stronger over time, Rebecca began to share her experiences and travel stories with Erin, and their mutual fondness for France turned into a bond that would knit them together for years to come. They would often dream of the day when they could both roam the streets of Paris, wine and dine in local bistros, and bask in the beauty of the Versailles Gardens, side by side. In anticipation of their future travels, Erin began taking French lessons to be better prepared for her next sojourn to the country, and Rebecca enthusiastically joined her, welcoming the opportunity to refresh her knowledge of the language as well. Through their dedication and shared passion for France, they were able to bridge the gap between their knowledge levels, becoming an unstoppable team of Francophiles. Together, Erin and Rebecca would embark on numerous adventures throughout France, from the medieval streets of Carcassonne to the sun-soaked coast of the Riviera, always with a newfound eagerness to explore, learn, and create lasting memories. And it was during these unforgettable experiences that Erin was finally able to achieve the same level of familiarity with France as Rebecca, the difference between them fading away like the last rays of sunlight over the Parisian skyline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: To get the most out of your limes, roll them across the counter while gently pressing down on them with your palm. The pitcher should be large enough to hold at least 6 cups (1.5 liters) of liquid. This will include the lime juice, sugar, and ice. Your standard granulated sugar will work just fine, but superfine or castor sugar (not powdered) will work even better because it dissolves easier. Keep in mind that, because you are not cooking the sugar, you may end up with a few un-dissolved grains at the bottom of your pitcher. Be sure to stir the sugar well to help it dissolve. For a twist, try ⅔ cup (150 grams) of white sugar and 2 tablespoons (45 grams) of honey instead. Since every one has different tastes, it might be a good idea to add the water 1 cup (240 milliliters) at a time, and tasting the limeade after each cup you add; be sure to stir the limeade well after each addition. You may find that the limeade is just right after only 4 cups (1 liter) of water. If the limeade is still too sweet or too strong for you, you can add another cup (240 milliliters) of water. Avoid adding the ice directly into the pitcher, because the ice will dilute the limeade as it melts.

This is typically located in large red or black letters.","completion":"Step 1: Determine if the fire extinguisher is empty or still contains extinguishing agent. To ensure safety, you must first check if the fire extinguisher is already empty or still has a remaining extinguishing agent. You can do this by looking at the pressure gauge if available or by feeling the weight of the canister. Step 2: Discharge any remaining extinguishing agent. If the fire extinguisher still contains the extinguishing agent, it is crucial to discharge it in a safe and controlled environment. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to safely discharge the extinguisher or consult with the local fire department for assistance. Step 3: Make sure the fire extinguisher is fully depressurized. After discharging the extinguishing agent, ensure that the fire extinguisher is fully depressurized. You can do this by removing the safety pin and pressing the handle or trigger to release any remaining pressure. Step 4: Find an appropriate recycling facility. It is important to recycle fire extinguishers at a designated recycling facility that accepts hazardous materials. Look for facilities in your area that specialize in handling and recycling hazardous materials, such as household hazardous waste (HHW) facilities. Step 5: Contact the facility and inquire about their recycling procedures. Get in touch with the recycling facility to inquire about their specific recycling procedures and requirements for fire extinguishers. Some facilities might require an appointment or specific preparation procedures before drop-off. Step 6: Prepare the fire extinguisher for recycling. Before transporting the extinguisher to the recycling facility, make sure the safety mechanisms are disabled, and the canister is labeled as empty or depressurized. This will help ensure that the recycling facility can safely handle the material.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Villa told a number of conflicting stories about his early life, and his \\"early life remains shrouded in mystery.\\" According to most sources, he was born on 5 June 1878, and named Jose Doroteo Arango Arambula at birth. His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. Villa was a brilliant tactician on the battle field, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead. As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa's secretary, Perez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras' former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros. Villa's war tactics were studied by the United States Army and a contract with Hollywood was made whereby Hollywood would be allowed to film Villa's movements and 50% of Hollywood's profit would be paid to Villa to support the Revolution. As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta's Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank's owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank's hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the hacendados (owners of the haciendas) and redistributed it to the widows and family of dead revolutionaries. Villa's political stature at that time was so high that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper pesos at face value. His generalship drew enough admiration from the U.S. military that he and Alvaro Obregon were invited to Fort Bliss to meet Brigadier General John J. Pershing. Returning to Mexico, Villa gathered supplies for a drive to the south. With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as Servicio sanitario), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the Division del Norte (Division of the North), the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa's troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and eventually at the heart of Huerta's regime in Zacatecas. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he accomplish anything important as governor?","completion":"Yes, as governor, Pancho Villa accomplished important things. He raised money for the revolution, printed his own currency, forced the wealthy to give loans, and took land from hacienda owners to give to the widows and families of fallen revolutionaries.

Review: to forgive that still serious problem Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The given sentence, \\"to forgive that still serious problem,\\" leans towards a negative sentiment, as it implies there is an issue present in the movie that remains unresolved. However, this negativity is slightly mitigated by the use of the word \\"forgive,\\" which implies that the reviewer acknowledges the movie's flaws but might suggest that other elements of the film compensate for this \\"serious problem.\\" To fully ascertain whether the movie review is negative or positive, it would be useful to have more context on the problem mentioned. Knowing its weight in relation to the overall movie experience can help in providing a more definite answer to the sentiment behind the review. In general, though, it is safe to say that the given sentence communicates a negative sentiment but with a possibility of forgiveness or leniency towards the movie's flaws. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the sentence: 1. The phrase \\"serious problem\\" alludes to a significant issue that persists in the movie. This creates a negative impression, signaling that the movie has flaws or shortcomings that impact the overall viewing experience. 2. The word \\"still\\" suggests that this problem has not been resolved, even after a certain period or despite changes made in the film. This compounds the negative sentiment, as it emphasizes that the issue has persisted. 3. The use of \\"forgive\\" implies that the reviewer might be willing to overlook the problem despite its seriousness. This has a slightly positive connotation, as it suggests that other elements in the movie might be strong enough to compensate for the serious problem mentioned. In conclusion, while the sentence primarily has a negative sentiment, there is room for forgiveness and potentially positive elements in the movie.

Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In.

The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, estimates of Gulag victims ranged from 2.3 to 17.6 million (see a History of Gulag population estimates section). Post-1991 research by historians utilizing archival materials brought this range down considerably. According to a 1993 study of archival Soviet data, a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. However, taking into account the fact that it was common practice to release prisoners who were either suffering from incurable diseases or near death, a combined statistics on mortality in the camps and mortality caused by the camps gives a probable figure around 1.6 million. In her recent study, Golfo Alexopoulos made an attempt to challenge this consensus figure by encompassing those whose life was shortened due to GULAG conditions. The GULAG mortality estimated in this way yields the figure of 6 million deaths. Historian Orlando Figes and Russian writer Vadim Erlikman have posited similar estimates. Alexopoulos estimate, however, is supported by indirect and misinterpreted evidences, and has obvious methodological difficulties. The tentative historical consensus among archival researchers and historians who utilize such data is that of the 18 million people who passed through the gulag from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7 million perished as a result of their detention.

Answer this question: when did the first flat screen come out??","completion":"The first flat-screen displays emerged in the mid-20th century, but it was not until the early 1990s that flat-screen technology became more widely available for consumer use. Flat-screen displays represent a significant departure from the traditional cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology that dominated the television and computer monitor industry for decades. There are two main types of flat-screen displays: liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma display panel (PDP). LCD technology was invented by Austrian chemist Otto Lehmann in the late 19th century and was initially used for research purposes. However, it wasn't until 1968 that George H. Heilmeier, an engineer at RCA Laboratories, developed the first LCD display using various liquid crystal structures to control light transmission properties. Working with his colleagues Louis Zanoni and Lucian Barton, Heilmeier unveiled an early prototype in 1970. RCA produced the first commercially available LCD–based display products in the 1970s, which were mostly calculators and digital watches. Meanwhile, plasma display technology was conceived by two researchers at the University of Illinois, Donald Bitzer and H. Gene Slottow, in 1964. The idea behind PDPs is the excitation of plasma gas to create visible light. In 1967, Bitzer and Slottow demonstrated the first monochrome plasma display. However, it would take another two decades for companies to refine and produce full-color PDPs for commercial use. In the early 1990s, flat-screen technology began making its way into the consumer market as laptop computers incorporated LCD screens. Meanwhile, plasma displays started appearing in public spaces, such as airports and sports venues. In 1997, Philips and Sony released the first flat-screen televisions using plasma technology. A year later, Sharp Corporation and Sony released the first large LCD TVs, ranging from 28 to 37 inches. As flat-screen technology continued to develop, both LCD and plasma TVs grew in popularity. In the early 2000s, LCDs began to overtake CRTs as the preferred display technology for computer monitors, and by the mid-2000s, flat-screen TVs became more affordable and commonplace in households worldwide. Their slim and lightweight designs, improved image quality, energy efficiency, and adaptability made them highly attractive to consumers. By the late 2000s, LCD overtook plasma as the leading flat-screen technology due to lower manufacturing costs, better energy efficiency, and a more extensive range of sizes. In recent years, LCD technology has evolved to include LED-backlit displays and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) panels, offering even better image quality, color accuracy, and energy efficiency. Flat-screen displays have revolutionized the way we consume visual media, and their evolution is a testament to the continuous improvements in modern technology throughout the past few decades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bruce Eugene Carver, one of the co-founders of Access Software, was involved in the development of \\"10th Frame\\". The game, a ten-pin bowling simulation, was created by Access Software in 1986 as a follow-up to their highly successful Leaderboard golf game. Access Software was initially established in 1982 and started its venture by creating titles for 8-bit computers. This included games like \\"Beach-Head\\", \\"Raid over Moscow\\", amongst others. Later on, the company was rebranded as Indie Built. However, at the time when '10th Frame' was developed, the company operated under the title of Access Software. Access Software, as a well-recognized video game developer, was known for its innovation in the field. A video game, by definition, is an electronic game that involves user interaction to generate visual feedback on display devices like a TV screen or computer monitor. These games can produce two- or three-dimensional images, creating an immersive experience for the players. The development of a game like '10th Frame' entails numerous stages ranging from initial concept development, programming, character design, data input, testing, to the final release. The complexity of the process reflects the technical and creative considerations in game development, highlighting the role of a developer like Access Software. So, based on the information provided and understanding of the video game development process, '10th Frame' holds the 'developer' relationship with 'Access Software'. It's essential to note that Bruce Carver, although a co-founder of Access Software and key figure in its initial development projects, is an individual entity separate from the development company itself. Similarly, Indie Built is Access Software's subsequent name after rebranding, and 'produce' is associated with the process, not the entity. Hence, these choices don't represent the 'developer' relationship with '10th Frame'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? from the following article ? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

The ease of understanding the lottery rules and regulations makes it an attractive option for individuals looking to try their luck. 2. Wide accessibility: The lottery is widely accessible in many countries, and tickets can often be purchased at local convenience stores, gas stations, and other authorized dealers. Furthermore, the advent of internet technology has allowed individuals to buy lottery tickets online from the comfort of their own homes, further increasing the accessibility for participants. 3. Frequency of draws: Most lotteries hold drawings on a regular basis, with some offering daily, weekly, or monthly drawings. This frequency ensures that players have plenty of opportunities to try their luck, thus keeping them engaged and maintaining a steady interest. 4. Low-cost entry: Generally, lottery tickets are relatively inexpensive, making them an affordable method for gambling enthusiasts to participate in the game without having to invest a large sum of money. The low cost of entry allows a broader range of participants, from those on a tight budget to individuals looking to play casually. 5. Large jackpots and attractive prize pools: Lotteries often offer substantial jackpots and various prize tiers, with some games having multi-million-dollar prizes up for grabs. These large payouts can attract a wide range of participants, including those who may not usually be drawn to gambling. The chance to win life-changing amounts of money adds an enticing element to participation in lottery games. 6. Contribution to charitable causes: In many cases, a portion of lottery proceeds is used to fund charitable or social programs. This fosters a sense of goodwill among participants who can feel assured that their money is being used for a greater social purpose. 7. Social aspect: Lastly, the lottery can be a fun and exciting way for friends, family members, and co-workers to bond by pooling together funds to purchase tickets and discussing their plans if they happen to win the jackpot. In conclusion, the lottery's simplicity, wide accessibility, frequency of draws, low-cost entry, attractive jackpots, contributions to charitable causes, and the social aspect of playing contribute to its popularity among people looking for an easy and enjoyable gambling experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It was not immediately clear what caused Tuesday night’s standoff, but local television reports said it began when police arrested a protester. Some demonstrators then tried to take over a tunnel in front of the government headquarters near the entrance to the office of the city’s leader. The reports said police used pepper spray to try to disperse the protesters but then retreated, leaving the tunnel in the hands of the protesters, who were building barricades to expand the occupied area. Earlier, police cleared barricades from the pro-democracy protest zones, signalling authorities’ growing impatience with the activists. Officers used electric saws and bolt-cutters to take down bamboo scaffolding in the Admiralty area, after a mob of masked men stormed some of the barricades the day before. Police also removed metal barricades from another protest camp on a road in the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area to free up a lane for traffic. Police said they would continue to take down barriers, and said officers arrested 23 men on Monday when masked men and taxi drivers led a crowd of several hundred who tried to charge the protest zone. The protesters want China’s government to drop plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory’s first direct elections, promised for 2017. They also demand that Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, resign. Leung has said there is “almost zero chance” that China’s government will change its rules for the 2017 election. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organisers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used teargas on 28 September to disperse unarmed protesters. Numbers have since dwindled and the remaining demonstrators, sensing that the earlier actions were aimed at testing their defences, are braced for possible further police moves to clear out their camps. Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist party’s monopoly on power.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: You will want as many sturdy boxes of different sizes as you can find. Cardboard boxes can be obtained for free from membership warehouse stores, liquor stores, furniture stores, discount stores, copy shops, toy stores, or grocery stores. Cardboard tubes can be salvaged from paper towels, wrapping paper, mailing tubes, and bolts of fabric. It is important to pick appropriate materials for your cat. For example, if your cat likes to chew cardboard, don't use tape or glue. Pick the materials according to whether you want to be able to disassemble some or all of the boxes after you are finished or whether you want some or all of the boxes to be permanently connected. Think about a shape that would fit well in your house and would provide comfort and entertainment to your cat. Decide whether you want different \\"rooms\\" to have different purposes: you might build an observation deck, for instance, and designate one room for sleeping and hiding, and one room for snacking. Take the future location of your structure into account. If it is by a window, you will want the cat structure to have plenty of windows, and you will want to build it so that it does not block your light. You might choose to build next to a wall that will provide support, or it may be freestanding, in which case you will need to reinforce your structure. Experiment with different ways of arranging the boxes: Put some boxes inside of others. Connect two or more groups of boxes using single, long boxes as tunnels or bridges. Make steps using a series of smaller boxes. Experiment with different size windows, doors, and trap doors. Draw windows, doors, or trap doors first before cutting. Do not build your jungle gym more than four levels high. The higher you build your jungle gym, the wider the base should be in each direction. Make an exit plan. While designing your jungle gym, make an \\"emergency hatch\\" so that you can access your cat without completely tearing apart and destroying the jungle gym. This is important when you need to give your cat medicine or take them to the vet. If you have multiple cats, you will want to be able to remove them in case they are fighting inside their new space. If your cats are new or if they are needy, they may decide they are trapped and need to be rescued. Design multiple exits in each box so your cats cannot corner one another. Use cardboard tubes as support posts in vertical structures. Cardboard tubes can also be used to create see-saws; fold one or two in half and place inside another for stability, then tape the tube to the bottom of a long, narrow box with holes cut into it. Kittens especially will be entertained by the unexpected rocking as they move from one end to another. It is easiest to do this in the room where the play equipment will stay. After it is assembled, it can be difficult to maneuver play equipment around corners, up or down stairs, or through doorways. Connect the boxes by building tunnels out of smaller boxes, and by gluing and taping everything in place. Make it sturdy. If you build the play equipment more than a couple of boxes high, you will need to reinforce the first couple of levels with something like cut pieces of cardboard. Cut cardboard to fit along the sides of each box and wedge it into the corners. Reinforce the floors and roof of the boxes with flat pieces of cardboard. Check for safety before you let your cats play on the structure. Try kicking and shaking your structure to test its sturdiness. Place objects the weight of your cat or cats together in each section of the structure to make sure it will hold them easily. Add soft surfaces to make the play equipment comfortable for your cat. Use materials that can be removed for cleaning. Cat size pillows can be made from old socks, potholder mitts, pillowcases, hand towels, shirts, or curtains. Sew up all but one side of your cloth, then stuff with cotton or other washable material and sew closed. Stuff socks with catnip, or tie knotted rope so it dangles. Be sure to avoid toxic materials and choking hazards. Add a flutter \\"curtain\\" over a window or doorway for your cat to bat. If your cat likes mirrors, try gluing one to a box's inside wall. Your cat might not instantly be attracted to its new toy. Catnip placed inside could break the ice. Put familiar toys or blankets inside the entrance room to encourage your cat to explore. Try temporarily placing your cat's food dish inside the cat house. If the structure isn't appealing where it is, try moving it nearer a window or under a sunbeam. Cats may ignore a structure for days or even weeks before they try it out. Give them time. Watch your cats as they enjoy their jungle gym to learn what they like and what elements of your design work best. Eventually each cardboard jungle gym will start to sag and wear out. Use your observations to design your next cat jungle gym.","completion":"The article provides tips on creating a cardboard jungle gym for cats using sturdy boxes of different sizes and cardboard tubes. Choose materials carefully based on the cat's behavior and preferences, and consider whether the structure will be permanent or disassembled later. Design a shape that fits well in the home and provides comfort and entertainment, with different \\"rooms\\" for various purposes. Consider the location near a window or wall and ensure adequate support and safety. Experiment with box arrangements, windows, doors, and trap doors; keep the structure below four levels high. Create an exit plan with multiple exits for emergencies, and use cardboard tubes as support posts and see-saws. Assemble the jungle gym in its final location, reinforce it with cardboard pieces, and test its sturdiness.

Given these facts, what contains most of the energy used by people worldwided among the following options: - heat - Light - coal - grasses - Cooking - glucose - A computer - gasoline","completion":"Among the options given, if we take a broader perspective, glucose and grasses (in the form of derived agricultural products) contain most of the energy used by people worldwide. 1. Glucose: It's a simple sugar (monosaccharide) and an essential component of many carbohydrates. More importantly, it's the primary source of energy for our body's cells. Through a metabolic process called cell respiration, the body converts glucose into a usable form of energy (ATP). Almost every species on earth uses glucose for energy. The food we eat, whether it comes directly from plant-based sources or indirectly from animal-based sources, eventually breaks down into glucose in our body. Therefore, if we consider the energy used within the human body itself, much of that could be attributed to glucose. 2. Grasses: While not directly consumed, grasses or more specifically, grains (which botanically are a type of grass) supply most of the world's dietary energy. Major grains including rice, wheat, and corn, collectively provide over 50% of the caloric intake of humans worldwide. They are the primary source of carbohydrates which our body breaks down into glucose for energy. These crops have been cultivated for thousands of years and are a dietary staple in most societies. Therefore, much of the 'physical' energy that humans consume for sustenance and survival can be traced back to these grasses. Contrasting with above, heat, light, coal, and gasoline are sources of energy, but they are used mainly for industrial, transportation, and household purposes (like heating, running machinery, vehicles, electric supply etc.), not directly for human physiological functions or food. Cooking is a process that uses energy (generally in the form of heat) rather than a source of energy. A computer and other electronic devices also consume energy, specifically electrical energy, but it's minor in comparison to the global energy consumption. However, if the perspective of the question extends to all forms of energy, including industrial and transportation energy, then the answer would be different. As of current statistics, coal, followed by gasoline (or more broadly, oil), would constitute the greatest part of the energy mix. Rest of the options, like heat and light, are types of energy but not energy resources. They are usually the output or result of using an energy resource."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During cellular respiration, cells convert oxygen and nutrients (mainly glucose) into carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of energy for cells. The carbon dioxide produced as a waste product is then transported back to the lungs by the bloodstream, where it is eventually expelled from the body during exhalation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and old electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country. Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place. \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later,\\" Lauren Roman, managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech trash is produced each year in the US. What's behind the tech trash pile-up? About ten years ago, major advances were made in computer and television technology. Manufacturers began producing devices like flat-paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy, glass-based technologies. The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs. CRTs have a high lead content and can be environmentally risky if not recycled properly. If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CRTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors. Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes. \\"People are returning old-style TVs with CRTs, but no new ones are being made,\\" said Linnel. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process...

I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

Short movie review: hated myself Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the phrase \\"hated myself\\" mentioned by the critic, it is evident that their thoughts about the movie are negative. The word \\"hated\\" conveys a strong negative sentiment towards the movie. It indicates that the critic either did not enjoy the movie or found some aspects of it deeply disappointing or uncomfortable, which consequently led to negative self-reflection or self-dislike. A more elaborate interpretation would suggest that, by saying \\"hated myself,\\" the critic might have experienced either one or more of the following: 1. Regret or frustration for deciding to watch the movie, possibly due to time wasted or disappointment in the film’s content, plot, or execution. 2. Discomfort or emotional distress caused by the movie’s subject matter, which elicited a sense of self-loathing or even guilt in the critic. 3. Negative identification with the film or its characters, which contributed to the critic's unfavorable personal response to the movie. 4. Dissonance between the critic's personal values, beliefs, or tastes, and the movie's themes, messages, or stylistic choices, which resulted in a negative experience for the critic. Independently of the other potential reasons behind the critic's words, it is quite clear that their view of the movie is decidedly negative.

How do clothing store employees feel when a customer tries on a lot of clothes but leaves without buying anything? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"1. At some clothing retail stores, employees might be asked to wear the company's clothing while they work. This is because the store wants the employees to look nice and show off the clothes they sell.

In the first sentence, Naa Bolinaa Saaka is described as a Ghanaian diplomat and a member of the New Patriotic Party of Burkina Faso.

In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt.

Does it follow that \\"Residents made snowmen and went sledding in the fluffy white snow.\\"?","completion":"In order to determine if it follows that \\"Residents made snowmen and went sledding in the fluffy white snow,\\" let's analyze the given information step-by-step: 1. A winter storm blanketed the Midwest: This implies that a significant amount of snow fell in the Midwest region. 2. Weather experts hyped it as one of the worst snowstorms in decades: This suggests the snowstorm was intense and possibly dangerous, which might discourage people from engaging in outdoor activities. Now, let's analyze the statement \\"Residents made snowmen and went sledding in the fluffy white snow.\\" a) Making snowmen and sledding are typical winter activities that people might engage in during snowy weather. b) The presence of fluffy white snow could be a suitable condition for such activities. Although it seems possible that residents could have made snowmen and gone sledding, the severity of the snowstorm might have made it difficult or unsafe for them to engage in these activities. Additionally, we don't have any direct information about the residents' actions during the snowstorm.

At various times in its history , the park has been used as a parade ground , a place for mass rallies and a public park . The area of the Lustgarten was originally developed in the 16th century as a kitchen garden attached to the Palace , then the residence of the Elector of Brandenburg , the core of the later Kingdom of Prussia . After the devastation of Germany during the Thirty Years War , Berlin was redeveloped by Friedrich Wilhelm ( the Great Elector ) and his Dutch wife , Luise Henriette of Nassau . It was Luise , with the assistance of a military engineer Johann Mauritz and a landscape gardener Michael Hanff , who , in 1646 , converted the former kitchen garden into a formal garden , with fountains and geometric paths , and gave it its current name .

The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. But I can use this background: The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material. What is an answer for this question: Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jacob's acid will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. This is because Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, which means it has a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) compared to the weak acid that Thomas concluded he has. A higher Ka indicates a greater tendency for the acid to lose a proton (H+) and form the conjugate base. Since a stronger acid has a higher Ka, it also has a smaller pKa value (pKa = -log10 Ka). Therefore, the stronger acid (Jacob's) will have a greater concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) relative to the acid molecule itself, resulting in a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid when compared to the weaker acid (Thomas's)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this article, we will explore different ways to nurture a woman's mindset, personal growth, and overall well-being. 1. Being a Woman is a Mindset The first step in embracing your womanhood is to understand that being a woman is a mindset. Recognize that this mindset encompasses both physical and emotional traits, and it calls for openness, courage, and resilience in the face of life's challenges. Tell yourself that being a woman means embracing these qualities, and be proud of who you are. 2. Read Coming-of-Age Books by and about Women Reading coming-of-age books can provide valuable insights into the lives and experiences of other women.

Make it a point to learn and practice these skills, as they will shape the way you interact with people and the world around you. 4. Act with Confidence A major aspect of embracing womanhood involves acting with confidence. Confidence allows you to express yourself authentically, make decisions in line with your values, and feel secure in your identity. To cultivate confidence, consider surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, take advantage of opportunities to challenge yourself, and be unapologetically you. 5. Learn About the World Expanding your knowledge of the world around you can have a profound impact on your personal growth and understanding of yourself as a woman. Travel, engage with diverse communities, or educate yourself on global issues to build a stronger connection with the world and develop a more comprehensive view of your own place within it. 6. Take Part in a Coming-of-Age Ritual Partaking in a coming-of-age ritual can provide a symbolic transition into womanhood. Consider creating your own ritual or engage in cultural or religious practices that resonate with you. Coming-of-age rituals can serve as a reminder of your personal growth and provide an opportunity to reflect on your journey thus far. 7. Make Goals for Yourself and Live Up to Them Setting and working towards personal goals is an essential part of embracing your womanhood. Reflect on your values and aspirations, and identify goals that will help you develop personally, professionally, and emotionally. Ensure that your goals align with your overarching vision of yourself as a woman, and commit to taking small steps each day to bring you closer to realizing these ambitions. Conclusion Embracing womanhood necessitates a mindset that encompasses personal growth, self-awareness, and a dedication to experiencing life to the fullest. By reading about the experiences of other women, honing social skills, acting with confidence, learning about the world, taking part in coming-of-age rituals, and setting personal goals, you can cultivate an empowered sense of womanhood that will shape your life for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Simon Zebo and James Sherry tries saw Munster lead 14-6 but Niki Adeolokun's score and a penalty try helped Connacht move ahead 20-14 by the interval. Adeolokun and Finlay Bealham added touchdowns after the break, while Shane O'Leary kicked a total of 15 points. The result effectively ended Munster's hopes of a semi-final play-off place. They are seventh in the table and face a battle to secure a berth in the Champions Cup next season. Connacht, who leapfrogged Glasgow, completed a season double over their Irish interprovincial rivals for the first time, and a spot in the last four of the competition now appears certain. Victory came as a boost to Pat Lam's men after Ulster ended their six-match unbeaten run in the competition, followed by a 33-32 defeat by Grenoble in the last eight of the European Challenge Cup. A stray Munster hand in the ruck allowed O'Leary to put Connacht ahead after eight minutes, but Zebo - Munster's record try-scorer - went over on his 100th appearance. Although O'Leary reduced the deficit to one point with a penalty, Munster's superb driving maul left Connacht scrambling backwards, and hooker Sherry touched down. With Anthony Foley's side down to 14 men after James Cronin saw yellow, Connacht made their numerical advantage count. The superb Bundee Aki burst through Munster's scrambled defensive line before moving the ball to Finlay Bealham, who sent Adeolokun racing under the posts. O'Leary's easy conversion brought Connacht within a point again. Foley's men found themselves under severe pressure at the scrum and, when Billy Holland was sent to the sin-bin, Connacht made no mistake with a two-man advantage in the pack. Referee Ben Whitehouse marched Munster under the posts for a penalty try that O'Leary converted for a six-point half-time lead. When Robbie Henshaw dropped a cute kick in behind Munster, Adeolokun profited from an awkward bounce to touch down, although O'Leary missed the conversion. Ultan Dillane's powerful carry put Connacht on the front foot deep in opposition territory and, when the ball was recycled, Bealham ran over. O'Leary followed up the conversion with a penalty with the last kick of the game.

Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Paragraph: Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

The four jihadists that arrived in Kandahar in 1999 were Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah. They were part of the Hamburg group, not Bin Laden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam.

I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Input: The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is out with its “Hot Wheels” list of the most stolen cars in the United States during 2016. The list is led by Honda Motor Co. Ltd.’s (NYSE: HMC) Accord. However, thieves have not been snatching new models. The 1997 Accord is the most stolen version. In fact, of the 10 most stolen cars, seven are 2008 or earlier models. Another example of this is that the second most stolen car is the Honda Civic — the 1998 model. Third on the list is the 2006 model of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) full-sized pickup. The list closely matches the top 20 best-selling cars of today. As a matter of fact, the overlap of the 10 most stolen cars to the top 20 selling cars of the first half is a match of nine out of 10. These are the Civic, Accord, Ford full-size pickup, Chevy full-size pickup, Camry, Altima, Corolla, Dodge full-size pickup and Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee. The NICB commented: While Honda Accords and Civics dominate this annual list, they are older, pre-“smart key” production models. Since the introduction of smart keys and other anti-theft technology, Honda thefts have fallen precipitously. As the list of top 25 most stolen 2016 model year vehicles shows, there were only 493 thefts of Accords last year. Technology is working, but complacency can defeat it. While thefts are down dramatically since their all-time high in 1992, thousands of vehicles continue to be stolen each year because owners leave their keys or fobs in the vehicles and that invites theft.

Far too many thefts occur because the vehicle is left unlocked and the key or fob is inside.

We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds. Fairytales are narrated to... Question: By saying \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\", G. K.

What is the answer for the question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle? from the following article ? The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged...

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"According to Pope John XXIII, one cannot ascend to a cardinal position without first holding what office?\\" Context: \\"At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"According to Pope John XXIII, one cannot ascend to a cardinal position without first holding the office of a bishop. This requirement was established to ensure that those appointed as cardinals have the necessary ecclesiastical experience, knowledge, and authority to hold such a significant position within the Catholic Church. The context provided gives a historical background of cardinals appointed in various times. In the past, there were cases where individuals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but were not yet ordained as deacons or priests, were appointed as cardinals. These clerics were inaccurately referred to as \\"lay cardinals,\\" and they were even allowed to marry. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was one of the last lay cardinals, marking the end of an era when cardinals were not necessarily ordained priests. The revision of the Code of Canon Law in 1917, promulgated by Pope Benedict XV, brought about a significant change in the criteria for appointing cardinals. The revised law stated that only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed as cardinals. This notable shift in policy aimed to ensure that cardinals would have the appropriate clerical background and qualifications to effectively carry out their responsibilities within the Church. Continuing this progression, Pope John XXIII further refined the requirements for becoming a cardinal. He determined that a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop unless a dispensation, or exemption, is granted. This decree reinforces the importance of having an experienced and authoritative figure in the cardinal position, as bishops possess the highest order of the sacrament of Holy Orders and are entrusted with the administration of the sacraments and the governance of the Church. In conclusion, Pope John XXIII made it a requirement for a priest to be consecrated as a bishop first before ascending to a cardinal position, unless a dispensation is obtained. This rule highlights the importance of having experienced, knowledgeable, and authoritative individuals in the cardinalate to ensure that the complex duties and responsibilities of the position are effectively carried out. The historical progression, from having \\"lay cardinals\\" to requiring cardinals to be bishops, demonstrates the evolving nature of Catholic Church leadership and the criteria associated with its highest-ranking officials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The park was designated in 1954, and was extended in 2016. Over 20,000 residents live and work in the park, which attracts over eight million visitors every year. - The River Aire is a major river in Yorkshire, England, in length. In the \\"Handbook for Leeds and Airedale\\" (1890), it notes that the distance from Malham to Howden is direct, but the river's meanderings extend that to . Part of the river below Leeds is canalised, and is known as the Aire and Calder Navigation. - The Aire and Calder Navigation is a river and canal system of the River Aire and the River Calder in the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, England. The first improvements to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826. The New Junction Canal was constructed in 1905, to link the system to the River Don Navigation, by then part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation. - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. - West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. - Skipton ( also known as Skipton - in - Craven ) is a market town and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire , England . Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire , it is on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the south of the Yorkshire Dales , 16 miles ( 26 km ) northwest of Bradford and 38 miles ( 61 km ) west of York . At the 2011 Census , Skipton had a population of 14,623 . - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name.

The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - The Yorkshire Dales is an upland area of the Pennines in Northern England in the historic county of Yorkshire, most of it in the Yorkshire Dales National Park created in 1954. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - The Liverpool City Region is an economic and political area of England centred on Liverpool, which also incorporates the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, and Wirral. Other, wider, definitions of the city region also exist. Depending on the definition used, the region's population is between about 1.5 million and 2.3 million. - Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the appellation of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey. - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - The West Riding of Yorkshire is one of the three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire, England. From 1889 to 1974 the administrative county, County of York, West Riding (abbreviated: \\"County of York (W.R.)\\") (the area under the control of West Riding County Council), was based closely on the historic boundaries. The lieutenancy at that time included the City of York and as such was named West Riding of the County of York and the County of the City of York. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Elmet was an independent Brittonic kingdom covering a region of what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Early Middle Ages, between about the 5th century and early 7th century. Although its precise borders are unclear, it appears to have been bounded by the River Sheaf in the south and the River Wharfe in the east. It adjoined Deira to the north and Mercia to the south, and its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly a minor British kingdom. As such it was well to the east of other territories of the Britons in Wales and the West Country (\\"i.e.\\" Cornwall and Dumnonia), and to the south of those in the \\"Hen Ogledd\\" (\\"Old North\\"). As one of the southeasternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, it is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Municipal boroughs were a type of local government district which existed in England and Wales between 1835 and 1974, in Northern Ireland from 1840 to 1973 and in the Republic of Ireland from 1840 to 2002. Broadly similar structures existed in Scotland from 1833 to 1975 with the reform of royal burghs and creation of police burghs. - The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is a canal in Northern England, linking the cities of Leeds and Liverpool. Over a distance of , it crosses the Pennines, and includes 91 locks on the main line. It has several small branches, and in the early 21st century a new link was constructed into the Liverpool docks system. - Wakefield is a city in West Yorkshire, England, on the River Calder and the eastern edge of the Pennines, which had a population of 76,886 in 2001, increasing slightly for the five Wakefield wards (East, North, Rural, South and West) to 77,512 at the 2011 Census. - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London. - Craven is a local government district of North Yorkshire, England centred on the market town of Skipton. In 1974, Craven district was formed as the merger of Skipton urban district, Settle Rural District and most of Skipton Rural District, all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The population of the Local Authority at the 2011 Census was 55,409. It comprises the upper reaches of Airedale, Wharfedale, Ribblesdale, and includes most of the Aire Gap and Craven Basin. - Liverpool City Council is the governing body for the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. It consists of 90 councillors, three for each of the city's 30 wards. The council is currently controlled by the Labour Party and is led by Mayor Joe Anderson. It is a constituent council of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. - Malham is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. In the \\"Domesday Book\\", the name is given as Malgun, meaning \\"settlement by the gravelly places\\". In 2001 the parish had a population of approximately 150. Malham parish increased in size geographically (to include Malham Moor) and so at the 2011 Census had a population of 238. - An administrative county was an administrative division in England and Wales and Ireland from 1888 to 1974, used for the purposes of local government. They are now abolished, although in Northern Ireland their former areas are used as the basis for lieutenancy. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists. - Bradford is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, in the foothills of the Pennines west of Leeds, and northwest of Wakefield. Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough. - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Wharfedale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - Skipton was a rural district in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974. It was named after Skipton, which constituted an urban district on its southern border. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - Airedale is a geographic area in Yorkshire, England, corresponding to the river valley of the River Aire (pronounced \\"air\\"). - Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet grew but slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War. - The City of Bradford is a local government district of West Yorkshire, England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Bradford, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Keighley, Shipley, Bingley, Ilkley, Haworth, Silsden and Denholme. Bradford has a population of 528,155, making it the fourth-most populous metropolitan district and the sixth-most populous local authority district in England. It forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and the city is part of the Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), which, with a population of 2,393,300, is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom after London, Birmingham and Manchester. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Ribblesdale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the dale or upper valley of the River Ribble in North Yorkshire.

He was so pleased with his mushrooms that he decided to share them. When their breakfast arrived the next day, each officer found some mushrooms on his plate. \\"Try the dog with a piece first.\\" Suggested one cautious officer who was afraid that the \\" mushrooms\\" might be poisonous. The dog seemed to enjoy its mushrooms, and the officers then began to eat their meal, saying that the mushrooms tasted wonderful. An hour later, however, there was great confusion when the gardener rushed in to announce that the dog was dead. Immediately, the officers jumped into their cars and rushed to the nearest hospital. Stomach pumps were used and the officers had a very unpleasant time getting rid of the remains of the mushrooms. When they returned to the mess, they sat down and started to discuss the symptoms of the mushroom poisoning. The gardener was called in to give a full account of the way the poor dog had died. \\" Did it suffer much before death?\\" asked one of the officer, feeling very pleased that he had escaped a painful death himself.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. To provide a detailed explanation of the entire breathing process, it begins with the inhalation. The overall process is called respiration, and below are the steps involved: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. This step introduces air, rich in oxygen, to your respiratory system. Your nostrils or mouth provide an entrance for the air to go into your body. Through the process of inhalation, you take in fresh air that contains life-sustaining oxygen. 2. Your diaphragm moves down. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscles found beneath the lungs, and it plays a crucial role in the respiration process. As you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, which increases the space in your chest cavity for the lungs to expand. 3. Your lungs have more room. As your diaphragm moves down, your lungs can expand due to the increase in space within the chest cavity. The thoracic cavity expands, and the ribcage moves outward and upward, allowing the lungs to draw in even more air. 4. Your lungs fill with air. With the increased space, your lungs can now fill up with the oxygen-rich air. This air travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, and finally reaches the alveoli – small air sacs where gas exchange takes place. 5. Gas exchange occurs. In the alveoli, oxygen is transferred from the air to the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide – a waste product produced by cellular respiration – is transferred from the blood to the alveoli, preparing it to be exhaled. 6. You exhale. After the gas exchange process is completed, you exhale or breathe out the carbon dioxide-filled air that your body doesn't need. This process is a result of the relaxation of your diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. Your ribcage moves back to its original position, and your diaphragm moves back up, reducing the volume of the chest cavity and pushing the air out of your lungs. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled. As you exhale, carbon dioxide leaves your body through your mouth or nose, completing the gas exchange process within your respiratory system. 8. You start the process over again. The entire process is a cycle that repeats itself, depending on your body's needs and activity level. This continuous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is an essential function for sustaining life and maintaining healthy cellular functions within the human body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Popular belief that the black friday after thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year . On these day many shoppers buy with the holidays in mind . To be sure there are still intense crowd on the day after thanksgiving , led by the doorbusters who show up at dawn for early bird sales . It is one of the busiest day in terms of traffic according to Elsa , my sister in law who used to wait for black friday to shop early for her christmas gift ... I told her how to ease her burden in shopping during such particular day . Question: Why would she be burdened by this day of shopping ?","completion":"Your sister-in-law, Elsa, might be burdened by shopping on Black Friday for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include large crowds, time constraints, financial pressures, and the overall stress of finding the perfect holiday gifts. 1. Large Crowds: One of the most significant factors contributing to the burden of shopping on Black Friday is the massive crowds that flock to stores. The feeling of being surrounded by a large number of people can be overwhelming, resulting in a stressful shopping experience. Navigating the crowded aisles, standing in long lines, and competing with other shoppers for limited quantities of discounted items can be physically and mentally exhausting. 2. Limited Time: Many shoppers feel pressure to find the best deals and purchase items quickly before they sell out on Black Friday. With limited time available to research and compare products, shoppers may feel rushed and struggle to make confident decisions. Additionally, shoppers who prioritize doorbuster deals may have to wake up early and sacrifice sleep, contributing to exhaustion and a lowered tolerance for stress. 3. Financial Pressures: Black Friday often comes hand-in-hand with expectations of deep discounts and spending, which can create financial stress for shoppers. Budgeting for holiday gifts is essential, but the allure of attractive deals can make it challenging to stick to that budget. The worry about overspending, combined with the desire to buy thoughtful gifts, can increase pressure during the shopping experience. 4. Gift Selection: Finding the perfect present for everyone on your list can be a daunting task even without the added pressures of Black Friday shopping. The challenge of selecting appropriate gifts, balancing the needs and wants of recipients, and dealing with the potential disappointment of not finding the ideal item can all contribute to a sense of burden during the shopping process. 5. High Expectations: There's a sense of anticipation and expectation associated with Black Friday, and the pressure to save money and score the best deals can be immense. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on the perfect deal or item can be a significant source of burden for shoppers, who may feel like they've failed if they don't meet their shopping goals. To ease the burden of shopping on Black Friday, consider these tips: 1. Plan ahead: Research deals, sales, and items of interest in advance, and create a prioritized shopping list to stay organized and focused. 2. Set a budget: Establish a budget before shopping and stick to it to avoid financial stress. 3. Shop online: Avoid the stressful in-store atmosphere by taking advantage of online deals and sales. 4. Opt for alternative shopping days: Consider shopping on days other than Black Friday, such as Small Business Saturday or Cyber Monday, for potentially less crowded experiences. 5. Pace yourself: Remember that shopping for holiday gifts is a process that doesn't need to be completed in a single day. Give yourself permission to take breaks and continue shopping at a more leisurely pace if needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What are the attributes of a developed country? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"First, let's analyze and answer the two questions separately. 1. What are the indicators of a developing country? There are numerous factors that can indicate that a country is in the developing stage. However, we can outline some key indicators: a. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: Developing countries typically have lower GDP per capita, which indicates the average economic output per person. b. Poverty Rate: A higher poverty rate is often found in developing countries, where a significant proportion of the population lives below the poverty line. c. Human Development Index (HDI): Developing countries generally have lower HDI scores, which combine income, education, and health indicators. d. Literacy Rate: Developing countries tend to have lower literacy rates, reflecting lower levels of education and a less skilled workforce. e. Health Care Access: Access to healthcare is often limited in developing countries, with fewer hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals available. f. Infrastructure: Developing countries often have inadequate infrastructure, including insufficient transportation networks, energy production, and sanitation systems. 2. What are the attributes of a developed country? Attributes of a developed country include: a. Higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: In developed countries, the average income per person and overall economic output are higher. b. Lower Poverty Rate: There is a smaller proportion of the population living below the poverty line in developed countries. c. Higher Human Development Index (HDI): Developed countries typically have higher HDI scores, which indicate better living conditions, access to education, and healthcare. d. Higher Literacy Rate: Developed countries tend to have better education systems, resulting in a higher literacy rate and a more skilled workforce. e. Better Health Care Access: Developed countries generally have more comprehensive healthcare systems, with greater access to hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals. f. Advanced Infrastructure: Developed countries boast well-developed infrastructure, such as efficient transportation networks, reliable energy production, and effective sanitation systems. Now, let's analyze whether these two questions inquire about the same information: The two questions are related, as they both explore the features of countries in different stages of development. However, they focus on opposite ends of the development spectrum. The first question asks for indicators of a developing country, while the second question asks for attributes of a developed country. Although the information is connected, the questions inquire about distinct aspects of country development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just like the color orange, they also have a nice, bright color and they smell really good! We could have chosen to plant lime trees, but limes are not as sweet as oranges. Limes are green and small, and they are often used to add a sour taste to food and drinks. But orange trees are better friends for our backyard because they will give us more delicious and sweet fruits that we can all enjoy. So, when we plant the little baby tree in the ground, it will grow bigger and stronger over time. It will spread its branches wide and grow tall, reaching for the sky. It will make new leaves that will dance in the sunshine. And one day, we will see small flowers called blossoms on the tree. These blossoms will turn into little tiny oranges and then grow bigger and bigger until they are ready for us to pick and eat. Once our orange tree is big enough and has lots of oranges, we can share them with our friends, family, and neighbors. We can have fun picking the oranges together and then enjoy them in many ways – eating them as they are, making orange juice, and even turning them into yummy orange jam or cakes.

Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views.

Keep a basket of cat toys near the desk for your cat to play with. You could even set up a kitty condo or play area near your computer so that it's near you and you can keep an eye on it as it plays. Rotate toys for added interest. Keep the cat's interest by only putting out one or two toys at a time. Try tying a string to your office door handle to provide your cat with the opportunity to bat it around. You can also try battery-operated toys. These can be particularly helpful if you need to focus on work but your cat likes a lot of play time. Every time your cat threatens to jump up on your workspace, grab the pointer and start playing laser tag across the floor. You can lead your cat away from your work area and into the ecstasy of play. There are even some automated laser toys that will occupy your cat without you needing to be an active participant. Set up a comfy space for your cat that is near your but not right next to your keyboard. Very often your cat just wants to be near you while you work or play on the computer. Indeed, the longer you're stuck there, the more it wants your attention and will be likely to put itself right in your face to get it. By placing a bed or comfy sleep spot near you as you work or play on the computer, your cat may be satisfied enough that it can see you to avoid feeling the need to attack your keyboard. If you have a laptop, your cat may like the warmth of the computer. Try using a heated bed to keep them warm and off the keys. The comfort zone may not work with a kitten.

Louise is a beautiful, but spoiled and superficial, woman who has amassed debts due to her lifestyle. She arranges to secretly sell her costly heart-shaped diamond earrings, a wedding present from her husband, to the original jeweler, Mr RÃ©my (Jean Debucourt).

He accepts cheerfully and, rather than confront his wife, coolly gifts the earrings to his mistress, Lola (Lia Di Leo), whom he happens to be seeing off permanently to Constantinople. At her destination, however, Lola soon sells the earrings herself to settle gambling debts and they are later purchased by an Italian baron, Fabrizio Donati (Vittorio De Sica), who is on his way to a high diplomatic post in Paris. Through a series of encounters, Donati becomes infatuated with Louise, later dancing with her long into the night at a ball. AndrÃ©'s long absence \\"on maneuvers\\" facilitates the couple's affair. With each passage of time, the Baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. AndrÃ©'s return prompts Louise to stop seeing Donati, but during a hunting excursion where all three are present, she witnesses Donati fall from his horse and faints. She is said to have a \\"weak heart,\\" but AndrÃ© sees this behavior as an affectation, and the event makes him suspicious. Louise becomes disconsolate and announces that she will take a long holiday in the Italian Lake region, alarming both her husband and her lover.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Which of these statements is WRONG? Answer: Possible answers: (1). HGH is a natural substance.; (2). HGH is needed to help bones and muscles grow.; (3). HGH is used as medicine for children.; (4). HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries.; Answer:","completion":"(4).

No one at his home wanted to discuss the case, but a woman who came to door said they're grieving too. ||||| (CNN) A judge denied bond Tuesday for five Michigan teenagers charged with throwing a rock off a highway overpass and killing a passenger in a van. The group of teens, aged 15-17, were arraigned in Genesee County district courtroom. They are accused of throwing a 6-pound rock off an overpass near Flint, Michigan, on October 18, fatally injuring 32-year-old Kenneth White. White was riding home from work when he was struck in the face, head and chest by the rock that crashed through the windshield of the van in which he was a passenger. Police said this is the rock that was thrown off the overpass. \\"There's no words to describe it,\\" Kenneth White Sr, White's father, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"I've buried my mother, my father, and my oldest brother in the last four years and this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.\\" White was engaged to be married and leaves behind a 5-year-old son. A GoFundMe account started by a family friend to help with funeral expenses has raised over 64,000 since Wednesday. \\"He keeps asking about his daddy,\\" Amiee Cagle, White's fiancee, told CNN affiliate WJRT . \\"And to tell him he's not coming back has been hard. I try to explain. He's so young, he's only 5, he doesn't understand.\\" Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell confirmed to CNN that based on their investigation, officials believe Kyle Anger, 17, threw the rock that killed White, but all five boys are being charged with the same counts. The maximum penalty is life in prison. Anger and Alexzander Miller, 15; Mark Sekelsky, 16; Mikadyn Payne, 16; and Trevor Gray, 15, were arraigned Tuesday and pleaded not guilty, according to Gray's attorney, Erwin Meiers. \\"To propel the size of boulder down from the Dodge Road overpass to a 70 mph vehicle that's headed southbound, you ought to know -- a reasonable person would know -- that that is creating a high risk of great bodily harm, or in this case, death,\\" said David Leyton, the county prosecutor, at a news conference on Monday. The five teenagers are being charged as adults, with one count of second-degree murder each. They are also being charged with conspiracy to commit murder, six felony counts each of malicious destruction of property and two other lesser charges. \\"Although the charges are all the same, the kids are all different,\\" Mark Sekelsky's lawyer, Frank Manley, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"The actions that kids may have become involved in are all different.

The teenagers include Kyle Anger, Alexzander Miller, Trevor Gray, Mikadyn Payne and Mark Sekelsky. >>Slideshow: Mid-Michigan mug shots<< All five of them were arraigned in front of a judge on Tuesday, Oct. 24 where not-guilty pleas were entered. They were charged with one count of second-degree murder (which is punishable by up to life in prison), one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, six felony counts of malicious destruction of property and two misdemeanor counts of malicious destruction of property. “I don’t think this was a deliberate attempt to take somebody’s life. It was a willful and wanton act that resulted in somebody’s death. These people should have known better,” Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said. “Under Michigan law that is second-degree murder.” >>Read more: Why defense attorney thinks all five teenagers were charged with second-degree murder<< The teenagers range in age from 15-17. The charges stem from the Oct. 18 incident that killed 32-year-old Kenneth White of Mt. Morris. \\"These particular individuals knowingly created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, knowing that death or such harm would be the likely result of such actions,\\" Leyton said. Police said White was riding in a vehicle that night when he was struck in the head and chest by \\"a very large rock\\" thrown from the Dodge Road overpass in Genesee County's Vienna Township. Investigators believe that rock was thrown by Kyle Anger. White was a passenger in a van driven by his friend, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said. The driver saw a large rock coming at the van and said the rock entered the passenger side through the windshield, Pickell said. After the rock entered the van the driver said he passed four vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road before he could pull over, Pickell said. \\"Detectives discovered several vehicles on the shoulder of the roadway with flat tires and other damage to the vehicles,\\" Pickell said. Leyton said White died from blunt force trauma to the head and chest. He sustained lacerations and abrasions to the head and face, a skull fracture, an injury to the brain, fracture to his facial skeleton, a huge laceration to his chest, and a broken clavicle and upper ribs, Leyton said. The rock that struck White was thrown from the north end of the overpass and was about 5 inches wide, 8 inches long and weighed six pounds, Pickell said. Prior to the incident that killed White, the suspects threw a tire off of the Farrand Road overpass, Pickell said. Afterwards, officials said the five went to McDonald's to eat. White was the father of four children, according to his obituary. \\"I just don't understand how somebody could just go out like that and think it's fun. I mean, you take somebody's child away from them. You take their father away from them. You take their brother away from them,\\" said Kenny White, victim's father. He said the punishment is a far cry from the pain and suffering his family has had to endure. \\"They can't give it the way I want it. So we'll just go with what they got to do with it. You know what I'm saying? I can't give them enough punishment. You know, because even if they spend 30 years in prison, they get to wake up every single day. They still get phone calls from their parents. They still get visitors. My son don't get none of that no more. That was taken away from him for something stupid,\\" Kenny White said. A judge denied bail for all five teenagers. They are set to appear in court again on Nov. 2. \\"It's a murder case and there was no anticipation that anybody was going to be let out today,\\" said Frank Manley, defense attorney. Manley is representing Mark Sekelsky. He cautions the community against painting all of the teens with the same brush. \\"Although the charges are the same, the kids are all different. The actions that the kids may have become involved in are all different. So even though the charges were read exactly the same, my anticipation is that there will be a distinction once the evidence comes forward,\\" Manley said. Manley said the fact that a man lost his life weighs heavy on the Sekelsky family. \\"I can only speak to the parents of my child who are devastated,\\" Manley said. All five of the teenagers attended Clio High School. Clio Area Schools Superintendent Fletcher Spears III released this statement on Oct. 24 regarding the incident: Clio Area Schools joins with the entire community in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Kenneth White in the wake of his tragic death on October 18, 2017. This is an extremely difficult time for our entire community. Whether we knew Mr. White, those who are being charged and their families, or have driven this same stretch of road countless times, many of us have a personal connection with this senseless tragedy. This is a stark reminder that we need to impress upon all of our young people that actions have consequences: and sometimes those consequences can be tragic. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with Mr. White’s family, as well as his many friends during this difficult time. As a District, we are also working to provide support to those in our school and community who have been impacted by this tragedy. Due to privacy requirements, imposed by federal law, we cannot provide any information regarding the students involved. Why would somebody do this? TV5 spoke to a psychotherapist about why the teenagers would do something like this. \\"Thinking wow that teenagers can get to that point where they lose their focus of what really are intended consequences of the choices that they're playing,\\" Dr. Thomas Haller said. Haller has been a psychotherapist for more than 20 years. He said something like this is typically the result of mob mentality. \\"Everything is focused through this filter of what will my friends think and how will they view what I'm doing or not doing. And so they lose the focus of outside and how it's affecting somebody else,\\" Haller said. Haller hopes this case will encourage parents to talk to their teens about peer pressure. \\"You have to help yourself stay true to you and not play to the notion that I have to have my friends like everything I do,\\" Haller said.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Resting or sleeping can have both direct and indirect effects on a person infected with bacteria. While sleep itself won't eliminate bacteria, it plays a critical role in the overall function of the immune system and the body's ability to respond to infections. Here's an explanation of how rest or sleep may affect the process of bacterial infection: 1. Direct effects: a) Improved immune response: Sleep has been shown to improve the immune system's ability to respond to infections. During sleep, the body releases various cytokines - proteins that help regulate the immune system. These cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and reducing inflammation. b) Enhanced recovery of damaged cells: During deep sleep stages, the body increases the production of growth hormone, which aids in cell repair and regeneration. This process can be helpful in repairing cells damaged by bacterial toxins. c) Improved emotional well-being: Chronic stress can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infections. Rest and sleep can help alleviate stress, which in turn may benefit a person's overall immune health. 2. Indirect effects: a) Supporting overall health: Rest and sleep play a crucial role in maintaining overall health, including metabolism regulation, mental health, and cardiovascular health. All of these factors contribute to a person's ability to fight off infections. b) Encouraging healthy habits: Getting adequate rest and sleep can lead to healthier lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise and a well-balanced diet, all of which can indirectly boost immune function and support the body in fighting infections. While resting or sleeping is an essential part of recovery and maintaining overall health, it is not a direct weapon against bacterial infections. A person with a bacterial infection should seek appropriate medical care and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations, which may include the use of antibiotics or other treatments, in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle and adequate rest."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context: During 1995 Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \\"The Wall for Generation X\\", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as \\"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\\", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\". The album spawned five singles—\\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\", \\"1979\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song \\"I'll Be with You Tonight\\", and \\"Thirty-Three\\"—of which the first three were certified gold and all but \\"Zero\\" entered the Top 40.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to calculate amount of unemployment in ohio Meet the criteria for unemployment insurance. There are a certain number of factors that determine whether or not you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If the following applies to you, then you are considered unemployed and are eligible for unemployment insurance and benefits.","completion":"First and foremost, you must be either partially or totally unemployed through no fault of your own. This means that if you have been let go from your job, it must have been due to lack of work or business closure, rather than for misconduct or quitting voluntarily. In the case of partial unemployment, your work hours must have significantly reduced due to circumstances beyond your control. Additionally, you must have a qualifying base period of employment to establish eligibility. In Ohio, the base period is determined by looking at the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters before the start of your unemployment claim. For instance, if you file your claim in July 2021, your base period would comprise of the four quarters between April 2020 and March 2021. Within this base period, you must have worked in at least two quarters and earned a minimum pre-determined amount, which is subject to adjustment each year based on average weekly wages in the state. Moreover, you must be able and available to work during the entire period of your unemployment. This means meeting the physical and mental requirements essential for your line of work, as well as being prepared to accept suitable job offers. Suitability is typically determined by factors such as prior skills and experience, previous wage level, commuting distance, and the working environment. It is also crucial to actively seek employment, making genuine efforts to find a new job by conducting job searches, submitting applications, attending job interviews, and networking with potential employers. Furthermore, you may be required to participate in reemployment services provided by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS). These services aim to assist claimants in re-entering the workforce, offering resources such as job search assistance, skills assessment, training, and workshops. Failure to participate in these services without good cause may result in disqualification from receiving unemployment benefits. To calculate the amount of unemployment compensation you are entitled to receive, Ohio utilizes a formula based on your earnings during the base period. A weekly benefit is calculated by taking the average of your earnings in the two highest-earning quarters of your base period, then dividing that amount by 26. The maximum amount of benefits that can be collected each week is currently capped at around 50% of the state's average weekly wage. Once your weekly benefit is determined, you can receive payments for a maximum of 26 weeks within a 12-month benefit period, provided that you continue to meet the eligibility requirements. In conclusion, calculating the amount of unemployment in Ohio depends on meeting specific eligibility criteria, such as job separation through no fault of your own, sufficient earnings and employment within a base period, being able and available to work, and participating in reemployment services. Once these qualifications are met, a calculation based on your earnings during the base period determines the weekly benefit amount and the duration of the compensation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\"The Superior Spider-Man\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.'

Article: The character can be based on a real person or well-known literary or mythological character, or created along common character tropes. Common character ideas include: robots, astronauts, literal statues (e.g. “The Thinker”), and mimes. For ideas or inspiration, look through pictures of living statues online, or go to an area of a nearby city in which living statues frequently perform. Start by visiting costume stores or novelty shops to find the necessary wigs and clothing for your costume. If you’d like to custom make your own costume, you can visit a fabric store to purchase an appropriate color and style of fabric, and then sew your own costume. If you have the option, choose a cotton fabric for your costume. Cotton holds its color well, even if you’re performing in rain or snow. To flesh out your appearance as a human statue, you can accessorize with objects to wear and hold. Look for objects that match your overall theme: if you’re a robot, hold an imitation computer; if you’re a statue, hold a book to “read”; if you’re a pirate, hold a plastic sword and hook. Sometimes just going shopping will be enough to inspire the costume, character, and actions you choose to perform. Yard sales, thrift shops and antique shops are best. You’re bound to find something odd that will spark your inspiration. Other helpful places for props are home improvement stores (if you’re looking for mechanical items) and fabric and craft stores. Items found at these types of stores may spark your creativity and give you ideas of how to accessorize your statue character. Many living statues cover themselves completely in makeup, to give them the appearance of being a statue, robot, or other non-human character. Depending on your natural skin tone, white makeup works best; copper and silver are other popular face-paint colors. You should be able to find costume makeup at a costume or hobby store, or through most online retailers. If using a white or non-metallic color, use water based cake-makeup as opposed to oil based. If you use oil, dust it with a finishing powder so it doesn’t smudge. In order to draw attention to your eyes, you may want to line them in brown or black with regular eyeliner. Adding extra makeup (like lipstick or blush) on top of your solid base may be necessary, but keep it minimal unless the makeup is an essential part of your costume.

As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and the hint, it can be inferred that Group B, consisting of individuals over the age of 65, would experience a greater decline in stamina compared to Group A. The factors contributing to this decline are closely associated with the aging process. As mentioned in the hint, during late adulthood, there are several physiological changes and increased risks that can affect an individual's overall health and well-being. These factors include: 1. An increased risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other age-related conditions. 2. A general decline in strength and stamina, often attributed to the loss of muscle mass, reduced lung capacity, and lower metabolic rates. 3. Impairment of senses, such as vision and hearing, as well as deteriorating reflexes, which can affect an individual's ability to carry out activities that demand physical coordination and endurance. 4. A weaker immune system, leading to increased vulnerability to illnesses and a longer recovery period. 5. Higher prevalence of chronic conditions such as arthritis and neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, Group A, composed of people under the age of 35, are considered early and middle adults. These individuals typically do not exhibit the same level of age-related issues faced by older adults and generally have better stamina. Their bodies are still in a phase of growth and development, and they are likely to have more functional capacity compared to those belonging to Group B. To summarize, Group B, consisting of individuals over 65 years of age, would have a greater decline in stamina as a result of the various age-related physiological changes and increased health risks that come with late adulthood. Consequently, this group would be the most affected by the loss of strength, stamina, and overall resilience when compared to their younger counterparts in Group A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: winch, ship, ground, construction site, suspension bridge Why is \\"ship\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The term \\"marine grade\\" typically refers to materials that are designed to resist corrosion from the sea or saltwater. This is an essential characteristic for materials used in maritime environments, as saltwater is highly corrosive, and prolonged exposure can severely degrade most materials. Hence, you'd potentially need \\"marine grade steel cable\\" aboard your ship, as ships spend most of their operational time in seawater and thus need materials that can stand up to this harsh environment. On a ship, the steel cable can be used in various components and mechanisms such as anchoring, mooring, towing, or lifting. While it is possible to use marine-grade steel on winches, construction sites, or suspension bridges, the phrase \\"aboard your..\\" hints towards a mode of transport, further leading towards a ship as the correct common-sense answer given the choices. On the other hand, the terms \\"ground\\" and \\"construction site\\" generally do not align well as transport uses. Using marine-grade steel cable on a suspension bridge might not be a wrong idea, especially if the bridge is in a coastal area, but the term \\"aboard\\", which refers to being on or in a vehicle (i.e., a ship, plane, or vehicle), makes \\"ship\\" the most suitable answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane?, using the article: In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane are: 1. Jola: The Jola ethnic group is the largest in Carabane. They are distinct from other ethnic groups in Senegal due to their language, egalitarian society, lack of political hierarchy, and absence of slavery. The Jola account for 80 to 90% of Basse Casamance's population and 6 to 8% of Senegal's total population. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit and geographical isolation. 2. Wolofs: The Wolofs are the second-largest ethnic group in Carabane. They are part of the larger Senegalese population and follow Islam as their religion. Wolof and Serer fishermen have been practicing Islam since the 19th century. 3. Lebous: The Lebous are another significant ethnic group in Carabane. Although the article does not provide extensive details about them, they are mentioned as one of the major groups in the area. 4. Serers (including Niominka fishermen): The Serers, including the Niominka fishermen, are the fourth-largest ethnic group in Carabane. Similar to the Wolofs, they have been practicing Islam since the 19th century. Additionally, the article also mentions the presence of other ethnic communities, including Manjacks, Susu people from Guinea, and a community from Guinea-Bissau. Seasonal workers from other countries, such as Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians, also visit Carabane for fishing purposes.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"1. no. While both questions are related to college admissions and the consideration of grades from various years of high school, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They focus on different aspects of the college admissions process. Let's break down the questions and analyze their differences. Question 1: \\"Do colleges look at freshman grades?\\" This question aims to find out whether or not colleges consider grades from a student's freshman year when reviewing applications. The main concern here is about the importance of these specific grades in college admissions decisions. Answer: Yes, colleges do look at freshman grades during the admissions process. The degree of importance given to these grades might vary among colleges and universities, but generally, freshman year performance is a part of the overall evaluation along with grades from other high school years. Admissions officers look for trends in academic performance, potential growth, and the student's capacity for improvement as they review academic records. High school transcripts provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's academic accomplishments, thereby highlighting their strengths and achievements over the four-year period. Question 2: \\"If I do bad freshman year and do good sophomore year how do colleges look at that?\\" This question focuses on a particular scenario where a student's academic performance differs significantly between freshman and sophomore years. The main concern here is understanding how colleges would perceive this change in academic performance and whether it will have any impact on their chances of admission. Answer: If there is a noticeable improvement in your academic performance from freshman to sophomore year, colleges will likely view it in a positive light. Demonstrating growth and the ability to bounce back from a rough start can be beneficial in the college admissions process. Admissions officers tend to appreciate resilience, determination, and hard work. However, it is essential to maintain a strong academic record throughout your high school career, as consistency in performance is generally valued by college admissions committees. Doing well in your remaining junior and senior years and continuing the upward trend in academic performance will strengthen your application and demonstrate your commitment to achieving academic success. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the weight of high school grades in college admissions, they tackle different aspects. The first question asks about the consideration of freshman grades, while the second question focuses on the implications of varying grade patterns across different years. Therefore, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"Mutations are what to evolution?\\" and the following answer choices: - Plants growth - essential - optional - competition - dangerous - non essential - voluntary - allow growth Now knowing that mutations are essential for evolution to occur and when that occurs, several things happen, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Mutations are what to evolution?\\" is \\"essential.\\" Mutations play a crucial role in the process of evolution, as they are the primary source of the variation in genetic material within a population. This genetic diversity is essential for species to adapt, survive, and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Mutations occur when there is a change in the sequence of DNA nucleotides. These changes can be caused by a variety of factors, including errors in DNA replication, exposure to specific chemicals or radiation, and certain types of viral infections. Although some mutations may be harmful or neutral in their effect on an organism, others can provide a selective advantage. These beneficial mutations become more prevalent within a population over time due to the process of natural selection, which favors individuals with traits that enhance their reproductive success. Evolution, at its core, is driven by genetic variation. In the absence of mutations, each generation of offspring would be identical to its parents, and there would be no room for adaptation or the development of new traits. This is why mutations are considered essential for the evolution process. The other answer choices presented, such as \\"plants growth,\\" \\"optional,\\" \\"competition,\\" \\"dangerous,\\" \\"non-essential,\\" \\"voluntary,\\" and \\"allow growth,\\" do not fully encapsulate the fundamental relationship between mutations and evolution. It is important to note that not all mutations are beneficial. Some mutations can be harmful, leading to decreased survivability or reproductive capabilities. However, natural selection often acts to remove these detrimental mutations from a population over time. Therefore, the broader evolutionary process continues with the help of mutations, shaping the diversity and adaptability of species over generations. In this context, the best answer to the question remains \\"essential,\\" emphasizing the critical role of mutations in driving evolutionary change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Una din slăbiciunile etichetei este faptul că consumatorii nu sunt conştienţi de aceasta, iar în această privinţă sunt de acord cu dl Wijkman şi, prin urmare, aceasta nu este deosebit de atractivă nici pentru producători. Translate to English","completion":"One of the weaknesses of the labeling system is that consumers are not aware of it, and in this regard, I agree with Mr. Wijkman, and therefore, it is not particularly attractive for manufacturers either. The labeling system is an essential element in the commercialization of products, as it aims to inform consumers about the characteristics, qualities, and origin of a product. However, its effectiveness can be significantly impeded by various factors. One such factor is the lack of awareness among consumers regarding the existence of these labeling systems. This lack of awareness can negatively affect both consumers and producers. Consumer awareness plays a vital role in the success of a labeling system. If consumers are unaware of the labels, they will not be able to make informed decisions when purchasing products. Consequently, the intended purpose of the labeling system in promoting transparency in the market and facilitating consumer choice is compromised. The lack of awareness of the labeling system can be attributed to numerous sources, including insufficient marketing and promotion efforts, complex labeling information, and a scarcity of educational programs aimed at increasing consumer knowledge. For manufacturers and producers, an ineffective labeling system creates a scenario where the investment made in obtaining certifications, conducting tests, and implementing necessary measures to be included in a labeling system does not yield the expected benefits. This lack of incentives for manufacturers may result in a reduction in the number of companies willing to apply and adhere to environmentally friendly or socially responsible principles. Consequently, this might lead to a decline in overall quality and sustainability in the market. Given these repercussions, it is essential to address the issue of consumer awareness regarding the labeling system to ensure its effectiveness for all stakeholders involved. There are multiple strategies that can be employed to improve consumer awareness of the labeling system: 1. Improving marketing and promotional efforts: This includes investing in advertising, social media campaigns, and public relations activities that aim to increase the visibility and understanding of the labeling system in the eyes of consumers. 2. Simplifying labeling information: The complexity of labeling systems can often overwhelm consumers and create difficulties in understanding the meaning and implications of various labels. Streamlining and simplifying the labeling information can enhance consumers' understanding and awareness. 3. Implementing educational programs: Developing and incorporating educational programs and initiatives that focus on the importance of label information and how to interpret the data can significantly boost the overall awareness of consumers. 4. Collaboration with retailers: Working closely with retailers can ensure that labeling information is prominently displayed and easily accessible for consumers. Retailers can also be trained to provide additional information on the labeling system to their customers. By adopting these strategies and maintaining an ongoing commitment to improving consumer awareness, the weaknesses of the labeling system can be mitigated, and it can serve as an influential tool for both consumers and manufacturers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not only is the eraser the color white (which looks dirty once used on colored chalk), but it is a quarter of an inch thick and the rest is the wooden handle! Well, I did not buy this for the fancy handle, I need a tool that is dependable and erases well. So I bought this for my child to use and it hardly erased.

Breaking down the review, the customer first points out that the bottom half of the eraser (which is arguably its most important part) cannot be seen in the product photo. They attribute this to the product's poor quality. The customer seems particularly upset by the eraser's thickness, which is only a quarter of an inch. They indicate that the bulk of the product is made up of the wooden handle, which they believe is an aesthetic feature that doesn't enhance the actual functionality of the eraser. Additionally, the customer also isn't fond of the eraser's white color. They observe that it starts to look dirty once it has been used on colored chalk, contributing to their overall dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the key function of an eraser which is to erase well failed to perform as expected.

Write some highlights for the following article: A man who helped break up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last week found out just what it's like to be famous when video of his heroic deed went viral. The only problem is that many people thought that the man in question, Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was actually actor Paul Rudd. That is until Rudd's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video, and someone who knows Kravit revealed his identity to the website Jezebel, leading to what Kravit describes as a 'pretty crazy day.' Scroll down for video. Hero: Ben Kravit (above) broke up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday. Mistaken identity: When a video of his heroic deed went viral, many started to believe it was Paul Rudd seen in a plaid shirt (above circled in red) breaking up the fight. No help: Kravit (above circled in red) has said workers at the airport and TSA agents were no help and seemed to do little to stop the fight from happening. Now, everyone wants to know more about Kravit, a brand manager who works for Dr. Pepper Snapple and is engaged to a woman who is no doubt the envy of many these past few days. It all began last Thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt. Then, when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong, he screamed, 'Queers! That’s what I’m upset about. This fa**ot right here.' Seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt, while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him. That is when Kravit, the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault. The whole time, a passenger named Andrew Kennedy was filming the melee, which has now been viewed close to four million times on YouTube. It wasn't me: A publicist for Rudd (above) revealed on Monday that it was not the actor in the video. America's sweetheart: Kravit (above with his fiancee) is a 28-year-old brand manager for Dr. Pepper Snapple. Good sport: Said Kravit (above with his fiancee) of the experience, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years' And that is when people watching the video started to wonder if Rudd, the star of films including Clueless, Anchorman and This Is 40 was responsible for taking down the homophobe. 'It seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it,' said Kravit. 'I have gotten the doppelgänger about [Rudd] before, but nothing like today. It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.' As for why he jumped to action, the young man said, 'I know people can get agitated at airports, but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control. I was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two, but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim.' He added, 'It was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things, let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it. I'm glad I, along with the others who helped out, were there to help the victim and nothing worse came of it.' Paul Rudd would be proud.","completion":"A man named Ben Kravit helped stop an anti-gay attack at an airport. He was very brave and kind.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Hunting.","completion":"What are the different hunting methods and techniques used by hunters to catch their prey? Hunting has been a part of human culture for millennia and has evolved in various ways. A wide range of methods and techniques have been adopted by hunters to catch their prey, driven by factors such as location, target species, cultural traditions, and technological advancements. Some of the most common hunting methods and techniques include: 1. Still hunting: This method involves the hunter quietly moving through an area inhabited by their target species, taking time to observe and listen for signs of prey. Still hunting requires patience, stealth, and excellent understanding of the animal's habits and habitat. 2. Spot-and-stalk hunting: In this technique, the hunter first locates their prey from a distance, typically using binoculars or spotting scopes, and then formulates a plan to approach the animal without being detected. This method requires patience and good knowledge of wind direction and animal behavior. 3. Ambush hunting: This technique involves the hunter waiting in a concealed position, often for an extended amount of time, for an animal to pass within range of their weapon. Blinds and tree stands are commonly used in ambush hunting. Success largely depends on the hunter's ability to predict prey movement patterns and choose an ideal location for an ambush. 4. Driven hunting: A group of hunters, sometimes accompanied by dogs or beaters, work together to drive prey from their hiding places towards a prearranged line of shooters. The hunters must coordinate effectively, as timing and positioning are crucial for success. 5. Pursuing with hounds: The use of specially trained dogs to track, chase, and corner prey has been a popular hunting method for centuries. Hounds can be used to pursue prey like foxes, boars, or bears, with the hunters following the dogs on foot or horseback. 6. Hunting with falcons: Falconry, or the art of hunting with trained birds of prey, is an ancient hunting technique often used to target small game such as rabbits, hares, or birds. The falconer releases the bird which then locates and captures the prey, while the hunter follows on foot. 7. Trapping: Traps are devices used to capture, injure, or kill prey without the direct involvement of the hunter. They can be set in strategic locations, such as along well-used animal trails or near burrows, and rely on the animal's behavior or habits to trigger the trap. Examples of traps include snares, foothold traps, and cage traps. 8. Bow hunting and modern firearms: Modern hunters have a variety of weapons to choose from, including bows, shotguns, and rifles. Each type of weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as prey size, distance, power requirements, and hunting regulations. 9. Calling and decoys: Hunters often employ calls and decoys to attract prey within range. Animal calls mimic the sounds made by the target species to evoke a response, such as an elk bugle or a duck call. Decoys are artificial imitations of the target species, often placed within the field of view of the prey to trick them into coming closer. 10. Hunting with ATVs or horses: In some circumstances, hunters use transportation like all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) or horses to cover ground quickly and pursue prey. While some argue that this method is unfair to the prey, it can be effective in certain cases, especially when hunting in large, open areas. These are just a few examples of the diverse techniques used by hunters across the world. Each has its unique challenges and advantages, and many hunters often utilize a combination of methods depending on their environment, experience, and target species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes.

I have a new situation: Two brothers had very bad luck when they attended a wedding. Tom fell violently ill after eating some tainted food, and he was rushed to the hospital. His brother Rob felt sick later, after eating the main course. Tom was infected with norovirus and hepatitis A, while Rob was infected with Giardia and Trichinella. But I can use this background: Common foodborne viruses include norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines, has been a recent issue on cruise ships, infecting hundreds of passengers and crew on certain voyages. Hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver, which is treated with rest and diet changes. Parasites are tiny organisms that live inside another organism. Giardia is a parasite spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals who are infected.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself... answer the following question: What were five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time? A:","completion":"1. New industrial processes: The Industrial Revolution led to the development and implementation of new industrial processes in Manchester, particularly in the textile industry. 2. New ways of thinking: The Manchester School emerged, promoting free trade and laissez-faire economic policies. 3. New classes or groups in society: The industrial growth in Manchester led to the emergence of new social classes and groups, including the working class and the industrial bourgeoisie. 4. New religious sects: Manchester's diverse and rapidly changing population contributed to the rise of various religious sects in the city. 5. New forms of labor organization: With the growth of the working class, new forms of labor organization emerged, such as trade unions.

What are the names of the two people who collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, while recording Smitten? Answer the above question based on the context below: After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft. He scored the 2003 film The Low Budget Time Machine and wrote two songs, \\"Birthday Video\\" and \\"Fake Purse,\\" for the Showtime television series Weeds in 2005. Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, Smitten, took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, during the recording.

Write a summary based on this article: A California State University Monterey Bay police officer was placed on leave and is under investigation for not shooting an emotionally distraught student with a Taser. According to the Statewide University Police Association union, the veteran officer could be fired because he refused to use his Taser on a student out of fear for the student's health. VIDEO: CSU Monterey Bay officer refused to shoot student with Taser SUPA President Jeff Solomon said terminating an college campus officer who put a student's safety first is inexplicable. The student and officers were not injured during the incident. \\"Our officer said and felt that there was no need for the level of force that was applied, and my understanding was that's why he didn't deploy his Taser,\\" Solomon said. Marina police, however, said that's not what happened, and claim the officer \\"froze.\\" According to police reports, the incident happened in February on Petersburg Court. The CSUMB officer and three Marina police officers responded to a call about a suicidal student. Solomon said the CSUMB officer successfully defused the situation and was able to help the student calm down. He left to get the student a cup of water after the student asked for one. While he was gone, the three Marina police officers began physically restraining the student, the student became distraught again, and the Marina officers told the returning CSUMB officer to use his Taser, Solomon said. The officer refused. The lack of action prompted Marina police to file a \\"failure to act\\" complaint. Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez said the failure to act is what led the Marina police to have to intervene. Rodriguez said the student had a knife and was non-compliant. Solomon said he believes the Marina police made the complaint out of fear of their own actions. The student's father told SUPA, \\"It defies logic and is extremely disappointing that, at a time when law enforcement is under fire for using more force than necessary, an officer is being terminated for attempting to use civilized methods to resolve a situation.\\" The university's spokeswoman said she can't comment on the pending investigation, but said the case is \\"more complex\\" than what was detailed in the SUPA press release. The officer, whose name has not been released, is a 20-year law enforcement veteran who has been with the University Police for the past eight years. SUPA said this is his first disciplinary offense. ||||| Stun gun (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) A California State University Monterey Bay police officer is on paid administration leave because he declined to tase a reportedly suicidal student, the officer’s union said. Marina police — which also responded and filed the complaint — said the officer in actuality froze, standing silent while three Marina officers struggled with the student. On Thursday, both agencies pointed to the other alleging, respectively, excessive force and lacking action. The news comes amid fresh protests spurred by officer-involved fatalities across the country. In the past two weeks, grand juries have failed to indict a pair of white officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, with a gun; and Eric Garner in New York City with a chokehold. Both were black men. In Salinas, four Latino men were killed this year by Salinas police officers, none of whom have Latino surnames. Tension mounted and spilled over in May following the death of Carlos Mejia, who was wielding a pair of pruning shears when officers fatally shot him. A man was killed nearby during an ensuing protest and an officer trying to help him was hospitalized after a thrown bottle knocked him out cold. Back in February, however, the CSUMB officer didn’t use his Taser, according to Jeff Solomon, Statewide University Police Association president. SUPA represents all CSU police officers. On that point, Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez can agree. “He just stood there,” Rodriguez said. But from there the accounts of the February incident on Petersburg Court somewhat diverge. According to Solomon, the CSUMB officer — a 20-year law enforcement veteran — arrived solo to a report of a suicidal man at the campus housing building on Petersburg Court. There, he found a man suffering a mental health crisis, Solomon said. “[The student] had superficial cuts to his arms and wrist,” Solomon said. “But we have very specific training in crisis intervention and our officer was able to talk him down.” Rodriguez, on the other hand, said the CSUMB officer initially declined assistance from Marina police but later asked their help in forcing entry to the apartment. Walking into the room, the officers encountered a bloody scene, Rodriguez said. “We saw blood everywhere,” he said. “On the carpet, on the floor. His wrists had been slashed. There was a bloody knife on the floor and a hammer on the bed.” Scorched marks on the sweatshirt the man was wearing led the Marina officers to believe he’d tried to set himself on fire, Rodriguez said. Although there were knives spread throughout the house, the student was no longer armed, Solomon said. “[The officer] got him to sit on the bed, [the student] wasn’t confrontational,” Solomon said. But the knife was still unsecured, Rodriguez emphasized. Solomon said the CSUMB officer then obliged the man’s request for a glass of water. Mid-errand, the man stood up and asked the CSUMB officer to hurry, Solomon said. Rodriguez, however, said the CSUMB officer actually left the room to either take or make a phone call. Doing so put the Marina officers in the awkward position of having to “take over” an incident that properly belonged to the CSUMB officer. When the CSUMB officer returned he found the three Marina officers struggling with the student. Solomon blamed the Marina police officers for “escalating the situation,” whereas Rodriguez claimed they were trying to prevent the man from accessing the knife or leaving the room. “He was already a danger to himself,” Rodriguez said. All three Marina police officers then fired their Tasers, Solomon said. Once the Taser cartridges were expelled, the officers then “dry stunned” the student — applying the Taser gun directly to his body. Solomon described the man as “150 pounds soaking wet.” When ordered to use his Taser, the CSUMB officer refused, but turned the device over to a Marina sergeant for use, Solomon said. Ultimately, the student wasn’t injured in the struggle, he said. Rodriguez said he doesn’t know whether the CSUMB officer turned his Taser over to the Marina sergeant. That would be strange, he added. “He was just standing there,” Rodriguez said. “One officer was pleading with him to engage, to help them.” Eventually, the three Marina officers were able to subdue the student and call emergency responders to assist, Rodriguez said. Since then, the man hasn’t again attempted to hurt himself. Both Solomon and the CSUMB officer took issue with the Marina response. “Generally, when one tool isn’t working, you usually move on to something else,” Solomon said. “There were four officers there. ... This doesn’t pass the smell test for us.” Following the incident, the CSUMB officer called the Marina sergeant to protest the action inside the student’s dorm room, Solomon said. Shortly after, Marina police filed a complaint and asked for an investigation into the officer’s “failure to act.” Marina officers on scene included a sergeant, a corporal and an officer. Together they have 32 years’ experience, Rodriguez said. If SUPA hadn’t alleged excessive force by Marina police, Rodriguez said he likely wouldn’t have commented for the media. On Thursday, he defended the Marina officers’ actions and questioned why the union waited 10 months after the incident to make their grievances public. “I get that they’re trying to save this officer’s job, but they did it at the expense of impugning the reputation of police officers they don’t even know,” he said. CSUMB police officials never alleged excessive force, Rodriguez said. Because of a good working relationship between the two agencies, Rodriguez said he thought his counterpart at CSUMB would have apprised him of any concerns. Ultimately, Rodriguez said he was “blindsided” by SUPA’s allegations and remained confident in his officers’ actions. University officials largely declined comment, citing the ongoing personnel investigation. Joan Weiner, public information officer, did note “this case is much more complex than what was conveyed in the press release.” The CSUMB officer in question has nine years’ experience on the Monterey Bay campus. He’s never been disciplined, Solomon said. Now, he faces potential termination. In the wake of notable officer-involved deaths in Ferguson, Cleveland, Ohio, and New York, N.Y., Solomon said he was shocked by Marina’s complaint. “We have an officer who showed incredible restraint in a very difficult situation,” he said. “He had it handled. The situation had all but been resolved when the other officers escalated it.” Solomon added, “We have an officer who did everything right and he’s not being supported.” Follow Allison Gatlin on Twitter @allison_salnews #salinas.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Simpsons has fired its longtime composer Alf Clausen, after 27 years of service. Statistically, most American adults change jobs at least a few times in their lives, and jobs that last for all or even the majority of one’s working life are exceedingly rare nowadays. To work successfully at the same job for nearly 30 years is definitely a big accomplishment, and it’s a distinction Alf Clausen has earned by composing music for The Simpsons for nearly its entire run. Clausen has been the FOX animated institution’s sole composer since 1990, starting from season 2’s ‘Treehouse of Horror’, the first in The Simpsons’ long tradition of Halloween specials. Surprisingly enough, though, despite scoring some 567 episodes of the series, Clausen was not tapped to do the music for 2007’s The Simpsons Movie, with that honor going to Hans Zimmer. Still, most fans assumed that Clausen’s job was more than safe at this late juncture, and that he’d likely continue providing music for the show until it eventually ends. That won’t be the case, however, as Variety reports that Clausen has been abruptly fired, just weeks ahead of The Simpsons’ season 29 premiere. The only explanation for this change so far comes from Clausen himself, who says that he received a call recently from Simpsons producer Richard Sakai informing him that his services would no longer be required, and that show was looking for “a different kind of music.” Despite the season 29 premiere episode — entitled ‘The Serfsons’ — being just over a month away, Clausen’s departure appears to be immediate, with the season 28 finale ‘Dogtown’ serving as his last effort for The Simpsons. The identity of the composer that will replace him has yet to be revealed, but their first work for the show will definitely be heard during season the 29 premiere. FOX has yet to offer an official statement on the matter. Clausen stands as one of the most respected composers working in animation, having earned a whopping 23 Emmy nominations — winning twice — for his contributions to The Simpsons. He’s also received 7 additional Emmy nominations for other projects. Some of Clausen’s other credits include Alf, The Critic, and Moonlighting. It’ll be interesting to see where he ends up next, as he’s likely to get several offers. The Simpsons season 29 premieres October 1 on FOX.

Clausen, whose Emmy record includes two wins (1997 and ’98) and another 21 nominations for “The Simpsons” dating back to 1992, has scored more than 560 episodes of the series, starting early in the 1990-91 season. He is believed to be the most-nominated composer in Emmy history, with a total of 30 nominations overall. He has also won five Annie Awards, all for his “Simpsons” music. His long tenure with the series has made him one of the most respected creators of animation music in TV history. Clausen’s last complete score for the series was for the season finale of Season 28, which aired in May. The season premiere is slated for Oct. 1, but it is not yet clear who will be scoring that episode. Speculation about Clausen’s dismissal involves cost-cutting measures, which have been ongoing at “The Simpsons” in recent years, despite its massive profits for Fox and executive producer James L. Brooks’ Gracie Films. Clausen uses a 35-piece orchestra every week — something that “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening insisted upon from the start of the show. Including costs of musicians, recording studios, and orchestration, expenses routinely run into the millions of dollars per year. Danny Elfman’s “Simpsons” theme is expected to be retained. ||||| Thirty years ago this month, America’s favorite animated family made their debut as part of The Tracey Ullman Show. To celebrate, CoS will be broadcasting live from Springfield all week with a slew of Simpsons features. Today, Lior Phillips talks to longtime composer Alf Clausen, who’s arguably the eldest member of the Simpson family, having been there since the beginning. You might not know the name Alf Clausen, but he’s been one of the most influential, talented musicians you’ve listened to for most of your life. For more than two and a half decades, Clausen has been in your living room, the roots of his music entangling the joy receptors in your brain for half an hour at a time. He’s covered seemingly every genre, from Latin jazz to Broadway show tunes. He’s composed songs that you know by heart, songs that can stretch a smile across your face year in and year out. Alf Clausen, of course, has composed the music for every episode of The Simpsons for the last 27 years. He’s the man behind endlessly fun hooks like “We Put the Spring in Springfield” and “You’re Checkin’ In” (both of which netted him Emmys). He’s the never-seen but always felt main character alongside the intrepid Simpson family, the brains behind the 30 or so musical cues in each episode. Simply put, he contributes a beating heart and dramatic counterpoint to the brilliant stories, the two halves inseparable and feeding off each other in a beautiful crescendo of hilarity and yellow-hued surreality. Because no celebration of The Simpsons could be complete without hearing from the one and only Clausen, Associate Editor Lior Phillips spoke with the Springfield maestro for a nice afternoon chat. Together, the two discussed Clausen’s entire career, specifically his transition from engineering to music, getting The Simpsons job, what it takes to compose the music for each episode, and his personal affinity for the Comic Book Guy. What’s a typical day for you? Do you work from the studio or from home? Well, I don’t work every single day, and when I do I typically work from home. With The Simpsons, we have kind of a scattered schedule for recording. So that you could give yourself a little bit of time off and a necessary break between the episodes? Yes, it’s funny you’re bringing that up because we are now enjoying the fruits of four weeks off before we go back to work. Oh my gosh! Do you get four weeks off every year? Or is this quite a rare occurrence? No, this one just came out of the blue. The network changed the schedule a little bit and everybody’s really enjoying it. So what have you been doing on your time off? Taxes. [Laughs.] I’m so sorry, that is awful. Yeah, that’s no way to relax, is it? No, but at least you’re mentally giving your brain a little bit of a break off from being creative all the time … unless you feel like you’re getting creative with your taxes, which is not a good thing! When do you go back to work again? Yes! [laughs] I think the next recording session is April 21st. Then we start recording and we do three shows in a row in three weeks. Then we’re finished for the season. For us, it’s 28. Amazing, huh? It really is remarkable. While it’s a series that’s ingrained in pop culture, I don’t think a lot of folks realize that it’s the longest-running scripted primetime television series of all time. And you’ve been a part of this for such a long time. Do you take any time to sit and reflect on things like that, on how it is such an important part of culture? Well, I don’t have much time to think of that. When we first put out the first Simpsons music CD, with a lot of the songs that I had written, it was on Rhino records the first time around. We worked really hard, we got the CD all finished and ready to release, it got released, and spread out to radio stations, and what not, and I did an interview with a guy who was hosting a primetime drive-time in San Francisco, in the morning, at nine o’clock. So I got on the phone with him, and he was very cordial. He said, “Let me ask you a personal question. What does it feel like to be an icon of pop culture?” And my first instinct was to turn my head 90 degrees, look over my shoulder, and see who he was talking about. Ha! I’m not surprised. With longevity comes loyalty and legend, at the core it’s an animated series full of dramatic characters that you really do feel like family, and you have been such an integral part of it. Does your family watch the show? Well, I don’t think they really understood it. Some of them do. Not all of them, but some of them do. I have a grandson who used to poo-poo The Simpsons when he was young, but now he’s grown up with it, and he’s eight years old, and he has watched every episode of The Simpsons. Little by little we grew into it and started to realize that something special was going on here. Are you saying that when you first watched it, it was a little bit left field for you? Did you not relate to the humor, or did you just think it was something you’d never seen before? To me it was pretty much the writing and the actors’ delivery of the writing that really hooked us in. Well, it’s been an amazing ride, if I can put it that way. Were you fascinated with music from a very young age? What’s interesting is that I started by majoring in mechanical engineering. I went to college in North Dakota at North Dakota State University, which is where I grew up. What happened was, I got a chance to go to New York City and stay with my cousin for six weeks. My cousin was a professional musician, a choir director, and a piano instructor. He and his wife just completely turned my life around. They wined and dined me in New York City for six straight weeks, and boy I’ll tell you I was just amazingly moved at all the Broadway shows I got to see, like My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, and West Side Story with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Seeing those things on Broadway for the first time, it was awe-inspiring. So, when I came back to North Dakota, I thought, Well, guess what folks: This mechanical engineering stuff is not for me. So I changed my major, and majored in music from there on. I went to Berklee College in Boston. While they’re completely different fields, there is a certain amount of critical thinking necessary for classical composition. And then, skipping ahead, Matt Groening asked you to score a couple of episodes. Yes, I believe it was back in 1990. So, he called you, and did you immediately say yes? I immediately said no. What! It’s a very, very interesting story. He had his secretary call my agent and had me come in for an interview. I went in and he said, “Do you have any interest in doing an animated series?” And I said, “No.” He said, “Really, why?” I said, “Basically I’ve been concentrating on dramas. I consider myself to be a drama scorer, and that’s what I want to do with my life.” He said, “Well, we look upon our show as being a drama where the characters are drawn. We’d like it scored that way, because you do that.” So, I thought about it for a while, and I said, “Yeah, I think I can do that.” So they gave me my first episode, which was “Treehouse of Horror I”. I scored that for them, and we had a lot of music. I thought, Boy, they’re going to throw me out of here when I tell them how many players I need. I talked to Matt about it, and he said, “Whatever you want, you can have. Let’s just see how it goes.” So, they put out a call for about 45 musicians. It was really a pretty hefty number for television. But it went well, they liked what I wrote, and they kept me. What was the reason that you felt you needed to work with so many musicians? Was it that you were hooked on the concept of it being dramatic? Or did you just feel out the music and give it what it needs. I think it was more the latter. I was used to working with a large orchestra, and I thought they were telling me they wanted what I gave everybody else, and that’s what it took. It took 45 players. And everybody was happy about it. So then of course we start to score the series and I couldn’t have 45 players, but they gave me 35 every week, which is pretty good. How does working with a big ensemble affect your composition? Well, I look at the orchestra as another actor, another player. I think everybody else really feels that as well. They always tell me that there’s another player involved with the orchestra, and it adds a lot to the story line and color. What do you feel is the correlation between the characters, the humor, and how that’s conveyed through music? Can a joke even work on its own, or do you feel that music is an integral part of that? A long time ago a musician friend of mine gave me a saying that I’ve never forgotten. He said, “You can’t vaudeville vaudeville.” Basically what it means is that you can’t score something funny with something funny, with funny music. It doesn’t work. My take has been, every time we have something dramatic to score, that’s the way I score it. I don’t score it like Looney Tunes or anything like that. Matt told me that too. “We want to be different. We want to do something that people are not going to expect. They’re expecting Looney Tunes and Disney, and we’re not going to go there. We want to be our own voice.” But then what is it like writing for a show that covers so many genres and time periods? There have been a lot of episodes that hit upon very specific cultural moments or even into the past, episodes set in the ’60s, the ’70s. And you have to write that music for something that has so many different narrative touch points. How is that for you? I think that’s one of the reasons they’ve kept me all these years. They were looking for somebody who could score all those different types of music in small clip-form. That’s what’s been fun for me. I think that anyone else who would have been hired for this job and stayed for this long would have gone to the nuthouse. [Laughs.] From one nutter to another, you sound semi-nutty to me. Is that just because it’s you have to be constantly creative? I have to do a lot of reference work. They want my cue to reflect the moment. Most composers don’t have a very broad stylistic palette, I think that’s the best way I could put it. They like that I can go into the files in my brain and come back with the style that they’re asking for very easily. You have to balance that nostalgia with originality and make it your own. If you get stuck and you’re busy searching through your brain-files, what do you do to push around the process? Your observation is very good about that, because it does happen. But fortunately not very often. If it does happen, I just step away from the cue for a while, and work on another one. We have an average of 35 cues in one episode, so, there’s a lot on my plate, and if one shows up that I get really stuck with, I try not to stay there very long. I go on to take a walk in the park to clear my head. That’s interesting. How are songs actually born? Are you given the script and then told to create the cue around that? Or are you given some sort of animation that you can visually attach your music to? It’s the visual animation that I get. I get a copy of the episode for the week. I like working that way too, because I get to see what the public sees. That makes it a lot easier for me. I have been very careful that I don’t duplicate myself. One of our intentions on the show is to keep it fresh so that the public doesn’t feel like we’re cheating them. Once in awhile I’ll have a situation where I’m really tired and I know what I want, and I’m going to pull a cue from three years ago, and I say to myself, “Yeah, I could use that, and nobody’s ever going to know…” Well, now I find that every time I do that, one of the episodes that has that same cue in it pops up in syndication, and there’s somebody watching the show in syndication saying, “What a lazy bum, man! He’s using the same music over and over, what’s the matter with that guy? Do you feel like you have a relationship with the various characters at this point? They are kind of like your family! Do you have a favorite character at all? Oh, absolutely. I’ve lived with them for a long time now. I like Comic Book Guy! But there are so many characters doing so many things, it’s hard to just grab one. Is there a specific song that sticks out? “We Do (The Stonecutter’s Song)” Oh, I love that one! Did it come out very quickly? That song was nominated for an Emmy as well. It came out very quickly. Most of them come out pretty quickly because I don’t have any extra time. They have to come out pretty quickly. [Laughs.] Yeah. I’m trying to remember. I’ve got two Emmys. One for “I’m Checkin’ In” and the other one where Homer wants the house of ill repute torn down, and Bart is working there and wants to keep it…. “We Put the Spring in Springfield”! But even just in terms of Emmy nominations, you have received more than pretty much any other musician, which is quite insane. Thirty is the number. When the cast has to sing certain songs, do you help them in that process realize their potential? Once in awhile I’ve had the opportunity to do that. What happens more often than not is that my music editor, Chris Ledesma, will take over the chore of conducting the vocal sessions to record the cast singing the songs, because we can’t be in two places at the same time. I’m very lucky to have somebody who understands music and who understands conducting. You only have, as you said earlier, a few seconds to make a huge musical statement, and there’s obviously huge challenges in that. But you’ve also been a part of The Simpsons albums and worked with Jackson Browne, David Byrne, and The B-52s. Are there any artists that you’ve gotten to work with on these albums that you found very inspirational? Tito Puente! It was great, so much fun. Tito came into the studio with his whole band. When I recorded U2, they just stayed in as a group of singers, as they are. We got a chance to hang out a bit, and that was really fun too. Boy, you can’t believe how many people were in the recording studio. Oh my! That’s a beautiful memory. For the film adaptation of the show, were you asked to score that? Uhh… They didn’t ask. That’s their business, but it was weird. I found out for the first time on a message board that I wasn’t going to be scoring the movie. I’ve been in that situation before. This was a little bit more big-time, if I can say that. I was kind of frustrated and curious as to why after all of those years, making all of those songs and scoring all of those episodes that they wanted to call someone else. Weird. But the important thing is to move on to the next, to the next, to the next, and we’ll see what’s going to happen. Try not to take it all too seriously. I haven’t even seen it to be honest, I had no reason to go. You’ve dedicated your life to something that is going to be in our lives forever, whether they stop making The Simpsons or not. Yeah, it’s pretty remarkable. The opportunity was certainly never expected and I just keep going and going. Of course, you know, my wife says, “When are you going to retire?” And I said, “I don’t know!” Because it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, I’ve said what I’m going to say musically and I don’t have to do any more. But on the other hand, I want to kind of ride this stage into the sunset, as they say, and try to see if I can finish the series. Everybody jokes about that. There’s an episode of The Simpsons where the kids are riding in the back seat, with Marge and Homer driving, and somebody says something, and Lisa goes, you know, “Could this be the end of this series… of events?” It’s really funny, isn’t it? I will say my wife has been a miracle-worker to keep me going, to keep me alive. I give her a lot of credit. That’s really heartfelt and beautiful to hear. What are your goals for the upcoming season? Surviving. Just surviving? [Laughs] What about having fun Alf? [Laughs] Sometimes it feels that way, I hate to tell you! There’s so much to do in a short period of time, and the producers need it when they need it, and we just have to do what we do and hope it comes out the way they want. I’ve been pretty lucky so far. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"After 27 years of creating music for the popular TV show, The Simpsons, the show's composer, Alf Clausen, has been let go. This means Alf won't be making music for the show anymore, even though he has been doing so for a very long time - nearly the entire time the show has been on-air, which is a rare thing and quite special. A person from the show told Alf that they wanted a different kind of music, and while fans of The Simpsons might be surprised and sad by this change, it's not uncommon in the workplace for roles and people to change over time. Despite all his work, Alf wasn't chosen to create music for The Simpsons Movie, another big project related to the show.

Puerto Rico (Spanish for \`\`Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. \`\`Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.","completion":"Yes, based on the given text, it is true that Puerto Rico is part of the United States. The text states that Puerto Rico is an \\"unincorporated territory of the United States\\" and is positioned in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, Florida. To further understand this association, it is important to look at the historical and political context behind Puerto Rico's status. The island of Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and later became a Spanish colony. After the conclusion of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico, along with Guam and the Philippines, was ceded to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Consequently, Puerto Rico came under US jurisdiction as an unincorporated territory. In 1917, the Jones-Shafroth Act granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, which meant that they became subject to U.S. laws and regulations, and Puerto Ricans were allowed to travel freely between the island and mainland. However, they do not have the same representation in the U.S. government as the residents of the states. For instance, Puerto Rico has a single, non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress, and its residents cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. The political status of Puerto Rico was further clarified in 1952 when it became a commonwealth. This allowed the island to have a certain degree of autonomy and self-government, while still being under U.S. sovereignty. Under the commonwealth status, Puerto Rico has its own constitution, a governor elected by the island's residents, and a local legislature. Puerto Rico's status has been a topic of debate and the subject of numerous referendums. Some Puerto Ricans support the idea of becoming a fully incorporated U.S. state, which would provide them with equal representation in the United States Congress, the right to vote in presidential elections, and access to federal programs and funding. Others advocate for full independence or retaining the current commonwealth status. In conclusion, based on the provided text and the historical and political context, Puerto Rico is indeed a part of the United States as an unincorporated territory, with its inhabitants holding U.S. citizenship and the island subject to U.S. federal law. However, Puerto Rico's commonwealth status also grants it some autonomy and self-governance, which opens up ongoing debates and discussions about its ultimate political relationship with the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an \\"amicable separation.\\" Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \\"no change in strategy or profits.\\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \\"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations.\\" On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at 43.875. The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director. Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs. And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs.

A Primeval Passage on Caddo Lake in East Texas EVERY visitor to Caddo Lake on the Texas-Louisiana border seems to come away with a profoundly personal impression. Anglers prize Caddo, the only naturally formed lake in Texas, for its trophy bass; canoeists rate its twisting, interlocking bayous among the most challenging to navigate. Environmentalists cherish its 26,000 acres as a rare, if not singular, wetlands environment. Caddo is more of a large bayou, composed of many smaller waterways. It is home to over 200 species of birds; hundreds of kinds of mammals, reptiles and fish; and countless plants, most prominently the towering baldcypress  some as old as 400 years  that erupt from its surface like limbs of drowned giants. But what struck me about Caddo Lake the first time I saw it was the powerful suggestion of the supernatural that it evoked. Honestly, it’s kind of a creepy place. Spectral shapes shift in the mist that rises from its cilantro-colored surface; ghost stories seem to ooze from its forested shores. Spanish moss dangles like serpents from cypress branches; spooky tales lurk behind the wary eyes of egrets and rabbits. Natural beauty by itself can stop you dead in your tracks, but Caddo also works on the primal circuits. It sticks with you. That, perhaps, is why my wife, Ann, and I return every few years to the lake, which sits about 15 miles west of Shreveport, La.: to make sure that what we saw the first time really existed; and maybe to figure it out, learn from it, even befriend it. For John Winn, 48, one of the lake’s most prominent guides, Caddo has been a lifelong companion. “In a way, this lake raised me,” he said, piloting his shallow-draft Go-Devil boat through the cypresses, which in early spring were equal parts dead graying foliage and new green growth. “Most everything important I’ve ever done has been on this lake.” Among Caddo’s many mysteries is its genesis. The lake was named for the Caddo Indians, who settled in the area in the early 1600s. There are two theories of its creation: The Caddo Indians held that it was formed by an earthquake and flooding; other, more recent histories say it was the result of the Great Raft  a huge logjam in the Red River, which in the early 1800s forced enough water into Big Cypress Bayou to create the lake. At the same time, the bayou became deep and wide enough to handle big steamships, which began heading up the Mississippi from New Orleans, then northeastward on the Red River and all the way to the hamlet of Jefferson, 15 miles west of the lake. As the 19th century progressed, Jefferson became Texas’s second-largest port after Galveston, a jumping-off point for goods headed for the fast-developing West. The town boomed, and the lake was a favored hideout for criminal elements drawn to all the new money  leading to the claim that, during this era, there was a murder a day in the area. Maybe it is the ghosts of these murderers and thieves that give the lake such a preternatural spookiness: what happened at Caddo, stayed in Caddo. Sometimes, the legends around Caddo cross over into the popular imagination. “I get requests all the time for Bigfoot tours,” Mr. Winn said, stroking at a gray-and-black beard. “Fine. But I’ve been out here all my life. I know places out here that the fishes don’t know about. I’ve never seen Bigfoot.” Mr. Winn turned the Go-Devil down one of the lake’s 42 mapped and marked “boat roads” in search of the animals that definitely inhabit the lake. A spring cold snap seemed to be keeping the alligators out of sight, but we saw plenty of turtles and frogs, hawks and vultures soaring overhead. The most interesting thing we saw was a beaver dam  a good five feet high and half again as wide, banked up against a cypress tree  looking every bit as solid as an Allied bunker. “These beavers back in here will get to be 70 pounds or so, and it’s all muscle,” Mr. Winn said. “There’s not much that can stand up to one except maybe for a gator, and even they find them too tough to eat.” Like a lot of ecological treasures, Caddo has been rather routinely abused, first by that steamboat traffic in the 19th century, then again, beginning in 1910, when prospectors built the country’s first “over-water” oil rigs to tap what was hoped to be infinite reserves in East Texas. In the last 20 years, Caddo has been assaulted by more-contemporary culprits, including mercury and other pollutants from past industrial excesses. So far, with the aid of several environmental organizations, the lake’s defenders have kept much of the vicissitudes of the 21st century at bay. It is one of 26 areas in the country designated for protection by the Ramsar Convention, a 1970s treaty that seeks to protect wetlands by asking participating nations to designate, put to “best” use and, if necessary, completely protect certain areas. What was this article about?","completion":"This article recounts the personal experiences and impressions of visitors to Caddo Lake, located on the Texas-Louisiana border. The lake, which is the only naturally formed lake in Texas, offers activities such as fishing, canoeing, and bird watching, while also giving the environment a unique character with its wetlands and bald cypress trees. The piece delves into the local legends and tales surrounding Caddo Lake, which is shrouded in an atmosphere of supernatural and eerie beauty. The history of Caddo Lake dates back to the early 1600s when the Caddo Indians settled in the area. It is believed to have been formed either by an earthquake and flooding, or as a result of the Great Raft, a huge log jam in the Red River. The lake played a role in the booming trade industry in the region during the 19th century, as steamships navigated its waters to reach the port town of Jefferson. Caddo Lake has faced ecological challenges throughout its history, including pollution from the steamboat traffic during the 19th century and the construction of over-water oil rigs in the early 1900s. In recent times, efforts have been made to protect the lake from further environmental damage, with the Ramsar Convention designating it as one of 26 areas in the United States for protection and preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the information you found on Google is correct. To provide further clarification, the common iliac arteries divide into two parts: the internal and external iliac arteries. The external iliac arteries, as you mentioned, bifurcate off the common iliac arteries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis. They supply blood to the lower limbs and part of the pelvic region. As they exit the pelvis, the external iliac arteries become the femoral arteries, which continue down the thigh. The internal iliac arteries, on the other hand, are the main suppliers of blood to the pelvic region and lower abdomen. They branch off the common iliac arteries posterior to the external iliac arteries. The internal iliac arteries provide blood to several pelvic organs such as the bladder, rectum, reproductive organs, and the gluteal muscles.

In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Write some highlights for the following article: Tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists carrying out Paris-style gun attacks, a former security minister has said. Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition. The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding. Scroll down for video. Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics. Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects. The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online. Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’ He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home. The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Lord West (left) was interviewed by the BBC presenter Andrew Marr (centre) alongside the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people's emails. Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Warning: Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'

The highway of hope had great sound effects. Possible answers: (a). Yes. (b). It's impossible to say. (c). No.","completion":"(c). No. The Highway of Hope is a silent film from the year 1917, which means that there was no synchronized recorded sound used in the film. Instead, music was usually played live accompanying the screenings. Sound effects as we understand them today were not present in silent films, as the technology to incorporate synchronized recorded sound had not yet been developed. Silent films often relied heavily on text intertitles to convey dialogue and story elements. Accompanied by live music, whether it be an orchestra, a small ensemble, a pianist or an organist, silent films created a unique atmosphere that relied on visual storytelling, music, and text to engage the audience. The era of silent films laid the foundation for narrative and visual techniques that later contributed to the sound films we know today, but the absence of audible dialogue and sound effects in The Highway of Hope means that it did not have \\"great sound effects\\" as we understand the term now.

Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Soviets at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.Tukhachevsky launched his offensive on 4 July, along the Smolensk-Brest-Litovsk axis, crossing the Auta and Berezina rivers. The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by Gayk Bzhishkyan , were to envelop Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border . The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Mozyr Group. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the Pinsk Marshes failed. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Why did the Red Army fight against the Polish line?"},{"prompt":"Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II. - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903 8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Erich Walther ( 5 August 1903 -- 26 December 1947 ) was a German general of the Fallschirmjäger who served during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership . - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Question: Why do young people seem more willing to take adventures?

Answer a question about this article: The history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the Cambrian explosion—a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend, and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. What type of diversity showed an overall exponential trend?","completion":"To answer the question, let's follow the information given in the article step-by-step: 1. The article discusses the history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic, which covers the last 540 million years. 2.

Process: - A mushroom gives off gills lined with basidia - The basidia gives off spores - The spores germinate - The spores create Hyphae - Multiple Hyphae meet and converge - They join with Mycelium - A hyphal knot forms in the ground - A primordia shoots out of the ground - A mushroom cap is formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no bread for the mold to attach to happens, how will it affect more hyphal knots form in the ground. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The given process describes the life cycle of a mushroom, which is a type of fungi. On the other hand, the perturbation hypothesis refers to a scenario where there is no bread for mold to attach to. To clarify the context, it is essential to understand that mold is a different group of fungi, and the life cycle/process mentioned above is not directly applicable to mold. Molds usually grow on organic matter like bread and rely on it as a source of nutrition for their growth and reproduction. They release enzymes to break down the available organic matter into simpler compounds, which they absorb for sustenance. Then, they produce spores, which are spread through the air and land on suitable surfaces to continue the mold growth cycle. Considering the perturbation hypothesis, let's analyze the effect of no bread (or the absence of a suitable substrate for mold) on the formation of hyphal knots in mushrooms: Since mold and mushrooms are both categorized as fungi, they have some similarities in their life cycles, particularly in the formation of hyphae and mycelium. However, they also have notable differences. Mushrooms usually grow in natural environments, thriving on decaying plant material, and do not require specific substrates like bread to develop. On the other hand, molds typically grow on moist organic matter, including bread, fruit, and other food items. Given the differences in their growth requirements, if no bread is available for mold to attach to, it has no direct impact on the formation of hyphal knots for mushroom growth. Mushrooms can still develop hyphal knots and progress through their life cycle using other organic materials in the environment, such as decaying plant matter. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no bread for mold to attach to does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of hyphal knot formation in mushrooms. Both mushrooms and molds are fungi, but they exhibit different growth requirements and thrive in different environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? another visit","completion":"Analyzing the phrase \\"another visit\\" in isolation makes it difficult for determining if it is positive or negative, as it largely depends on the context in which it is used, and the emotions, experiences, and opinions associated with the visit. Here are a few possible scenarios to consider: 1. Positive sentiment: If the phrase \\"another visit\\" refers to a situation in which the speaker enjoys the company of the person being visited or appreciates the specific location they visit, then it can be considered as having a positive connotation. For example, visiting a close friend, a family member, or a favorite vacation spot would be situations where \\"another visit\\" is a favorable event. In such cases, \\"another visit\\" can imply looking forward to spending time in a familiar, enjoyable, or comforting environment. 2. Negative sentiment: However, if the phrase \\"another visit\\" involves an encounter with an unpleasant or difficult individual or visiting a location that has negative associations, then it can be considered as having a negative connotation. For instance, if someone is talking about making another visit to a doctor's office where the medical treatments have been painful or uncomfortable, the phrase would have a negative tone. Similarly, visiting a place that holds bad memories, such as a childhood home filled with negative experiences, could also create an unfavorable perspective on \\"another visit.\\" 3. Neutral sentiment: In some cases, \\"another visit\\" may not carry any strong positive or negative implications, but rather be perceived as a neutral statement. For example, if a person is discussing routine visits to a location for work purposes, this might not evoke strong emotions. In situations like these, \\"another visit\\" is simply describing an event or action without carrying significant emotional weight. Ultimately, the positivity or negativity of the phrase \\"another visit\\" is dependent on the context it is placed in, the emotions tied to the specific visit, and the relationships and experiences connected to that particular encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under their commercial agreement after their relations were strained following disagreement over policy in Romania, the Soviet war with Finland, Germany falling behind in its deliveries of goods under the pact and with Stalin worried that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders, settled some Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases. However, in late August, Germany arranged its own occupation of Romania, targeting oil fields.

Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Content: The review seems to be focused on a specific issue that the user is facing, which is that their game (presumably \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\") is not working properly. This suggests a negative experience, and they might be seeking assistance. However, the content of the review is minimal and does not provide enough information about the problem. For instance, it does not provide details about the device they are using, the nature of the issue (e.g., crashes, freezes, etc.), or any steps they have tried to resolve it. This makes it difficult for others to understand the root of the problem and provide help. Rating: 2/5 2. Clarity: The clarity of the review is not optimal, as grammatical errors and word choices make it difficult to understand the core message. For example, \\"My games has not working like\\" should potentially be \\"My game is not working like.\\" Additionally, the title of the game \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\" is not correctly formatted. It could lead to confusion for those who are not familiar with the game or misinterpret the issue being addressed. Rating: 1/5 3. Helpfulness: As mentioned earlier, the review lacks essential details about the problem, making it hard for other users or developers to provide support or solutions. A helpful review would include information about the device being used, the nature of the issue, and any troubleshooting steps taken before writing the review. Since it does not have these elements, it is of very limited use for other users or the game's developer. Rating: 1/5 Taking all of these factors into account, we can rate this review as follows: Average Rating: (2+1+1)/3 = 1.33 To round off this rating to the nearest whole number on a scale of 1-5, we can conclude that this review scores a 1 out of 5. This reflects that the review is least favorable in terms of content, clarity, and helpfulness. A more effective review would provide a detailed description of the issue, proper grammar, and additional information that would allow others to better understand and potentially offer appropriate solutions to the problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year. Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate. It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes. The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.

Pupils from All Saints Primary School have been working with Bradford University students to produce a documentary on bullying awareness. Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, said: \\"We don't want other children to suffer what he had to suffer.\\" She said there was \\"a lesson to be learnt from his tragic death\\" and made an appeal to bullies. \\"I don't know what Asad went through, but please don't do it to any other young child. \\"We had no idea he was suffering from bullying because at home he was just [his usual self] running around, playing and being very talkative... if we had a slight idea that he was, things would've been different.\\" More on this story and others from across Yorkshire Project Coordinator Sabeen Raja said the film was a good tribute to the 11-year-old. \\"I think it's a good way for the children to see the impact that bullying may have and I think it's a good way to remember him, to know that he didn't leave in a way without something being done about it.\\" Hundreds of people attended his funeral last year and his death affected the local community with more than 200 people gathering at a centre in Girlington in October to offer support and discuss the issue of bullying.

He was taken to hospital but died a short time later.","completion":"Last September, Asad Khan, a young boy from Bradford, passed away. His family believes that bullying was a contributing factor in his tragic death. Since then, students from All Saints Primary School and Bradford University have collaborated to create a documentary aiming to raise awareness about the devastating effects of bullying. Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, shared her thoughts about Asad's experience, expressing that she hopes no other child has to endure the pain and suffering that Asad had to go through. She also mentioned that if the family had been aware of the bullying issues, things might have been different. Asad's usual behavior at home, running around and playing, did not reveal any signs of suffering or bullying. Sabeen Raja, the project coordinator, felt that the film was a fitting tribute to Asad, who was only 11 years old at the time of his passing. The documentary serves to demonstrate the immense impact that bullying can have on a young life. Importantly, it also ensures that something positive is done in the wake of such a tragic event, which has left an indelible mark on the community. Asad's death was deeply felt by the local community. Hundreds of people attended his funeral, and over 200 people gathered in Girlington the following October to offer their support and share their thoughts on the issue of bullying. Asad was found unresponsive in his home on Tile Street by his mother, and despite being immediately taken to the hospital, he passed away shortly after. This heart-rending incident serves as a reminder of the grave harm that bullying can cause, and the importance of developing and promoting empathy, kindness, and understanding in order to prevent such tragedies in the future. By sharing Asad's story, those working on the documentary hope to foster change and protect other young lives from experiencing this unwarranted pain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will happen to Cameron? Possible answers: text Aubrey back, spend time alone, be expecting something Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it can be deduced that Cameron will likely return Aubrey's phone call since Aubrey is awaiting a response. Although it is not explicitly mentioned what Cameron is doing or what his intentions are, we can make an educated guess based on the provided information. Aubrey is awaiting a response which suggests that their relationship or friendship holds some importance. Friends and people who care for one another generally reply to missed calls or messages in a timely manner, so it is reasonable to believe that Cameron will be returning Aubrey's call eventually. It is evident that communication is expected between the two of them. Moreover, the possible answer \\"text Aubrey back\\" suggests an alternate means for Cameron to get back to Aubrey, but since Aubrey is waiting for a phone call, it's more likely that Cameron will call her back instead of texting. Providing a response through a text message may be less personal and might not be the preferred method of addressing the matter at hand. The other possible answers, \\"spend time alone\\" and \\"be expecting something,\\" do not directly relate to Aubrey's anticipation of Cameron's phone call. Spending time alone does not provide any insight into Cameron returning Aubrey's call, as it could simply be an unrelated action or a way for Cameron to reflect on what to say later. Additionally, \\"be expecting something\\" could relate to Cameron's anticipation of an outcome, but this too doesn't indicate whether or not he will be returning Aubrey's call. Based on the given context, the most likely and detailed answer would be that Cameron will return Aubrey's phone call once he becomes available or finds a suitable time to get in touch. This action will maintain their communication and address the matter that prompted Aubrey's initial call.

I read this background article the other day: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. I am facing a new situation today: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which coat would most likely become more common, darker or lighter? A:","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article on natural selection, it is likely that the darker coat will become more common among squirrels in Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction. The reason for this is that darker coats are more suitable for colder environments, as they can absorb more sunlight and provide better insulation, helping the squirrels to stay warm and maintain their body temperature. Since the environment in Mike's city is cold, squirrels with darker coats would have an advantage over those with lighter coats in terms of survival and reproduction. As a result, natural selection would cause the beneficial trait of having a darker coat to become more common in the squirrel population over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from: +no. +yes.","completion":"+no. While these two questions are related, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about the specifics of how the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, while the second question inquires about the broader impact the Ottomans had on history. To answer the first question: The Ottomans conquered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, on May 29, 1453, under the leadership of Sultan Mehmed II. The siege of Constantin-ople lasted for 53 days and was a turning point in history, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's dominance in the region. Several factors contributed to the successful Ottoman conquest of Constantinople: 1. Preparation and planning: Mehmed II meticulously prepared for the siege by stockpiling weapons, gathering a large, well-trained army, and developing a detailed strategy. The overall force consisted of around 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers, with a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. 2. Technological advantage: The Ottomans utilized advanced weaponry, specifically powerful, large-scale siege cannons. These cannons could fire massive stone projectiles that could penetrate the city's walls. The largest cannon, called the \\"Basilica,\\" had a barrel 27 feet long and required more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder per shot. 3. Naval blockade: Sultan Mehmed II ordered a naval blockade to cut off Constantinople's access to outside supplies and reinforcements. The Ottoman fleet successfully stopped any Byzantine ships from entering or leaving the city's harbor, which slowly weakened the defenders' resolve. 4. Weak Byzantine defenses: Constantinople's walls were still formidable; however, the city had been in decline, and its defenses suffered from lack of maintenance and insufficient manpower. Additionally, the Byzantine Empire did not receive the support and reinforcements it needed from European allies due to a lack of unity among Christian nations. 5. Final assault: The decisive attack on the city was launched on May 29, 1453. Mehmed II ordered a multi-front assault, attacking along the entire length of the land walls and creating an overwhelming offensive force. After hours of intense combat, Ottoman troops breached the walls and entered the city, ultimately leading to the fall of Constantinople. To answer the second question: The Ottomans changed history in several ways through their conquests and governance of their vast empire: 1. Fusion of cultures: The Ottoman Empire comprised diverse territories and ethnicities within its borders, which resulted in a fusion of cultures. Art, architecture, science, and literature benefitted from the blending of Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic influences throughout the empire. 2. Trade: The Ottomans strategically controlled key trade routes between Europe and Asia, including the Silk Road. This enabled the Ottomans to influence global trade, encourage cultural exchange, and accumulate wealth. 3. Religion: The conquest of Constantinople and subsequent expansion of the Ottoman Empire marked the spread of Islam throughout southeastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. However, the Ottomans were often tolerant of other religions within their empire, fostering a relatively peaceful coexistence among different faiths. 4. Military advancements: The Ottomans had a highly effective and well-disciplined military force, incorporating innovations in warfare, such as the aforementioned cannons. These advancements not only contributed to the Ottoman Empire's expansions but also influenced other military powers in Europe at the time. 5. Decline of feudalism: The Ottomans' centralized, bureaucratic government system contributed to the decline of feudalism in Europe. As the empire expanded into Europe, feudal lords who once held significant power found themselves subordinate to the centralized authority of the Ottoman Empire or losing territories altogether. In conclusion, these two questions address different aspects of the Ottoman Empire's impact on history. The first question pertains to the specific events surrounding the conquest of Constantinople, while the second question concerns the broad and long-lasting effects of the Ottoman Empire on world history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\".

Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Please answer this question : Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's first review the given information and recall Le Châtelier's principle, which states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a stress, the system will attempt to counteract the stress by adjusting the equilibrium until a new balance is established. In cases A and B, both represent disturbed equilibriums with different stress factors that favored either the forward or the reverse reactions. In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that the reactants are being consumed to form products at a faster rate than the reverse reaction. As a result of this disturbance, the system is no longer at equilibrium and will attempt to re-establish equilibrium by favoring the forward reaction. Consequently, the concentration of the reactants will decrease, and the concentration of the products will increase. The chemical system will continue to shift in this direction until a new equilibrium is reached. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored. This means that the products are being consumed to form reactants at a faster rate than the forward reaction. The disturbance in equilibrium causes the system to respond by favoring the reverse reaction. This will result in an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products. The chemical system will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is established. To address the question, in case A, the concentration of the reactants would decrease compared to case B, where the concentration of the reactants would increase.

The negative aspects of the review are that the shuttle service was not punctual, as it arrived over 45 minutes late, causing inconvenience. Additionally, an even worse experience is mentioned, where two girls had to wait for almost 2 hours because their bus never came. Implicitly, this highlights that reliability is an issue with this particular shuttle service, which contributes to the overall negative tone of the review.

The answer is:","completion":"walking away from beach To provide a detailed explanation, let's first analyze the question and the given options. The question presents a scenario in which Sue is walking on the beach and mentions a specific action: \\"As she walks away from the ocean.\\" The task is then to complete the statement concerning her ability to hear the waves on the shore as she carries out this action. We are given two choices: (A) harder or (B) easier. Now, let's consider the scenario more closely. Sue is walking away from the ocean, which means she is moving in a direction that increases the distance between her and the source of the sound, in this case, the waves on the shore. Sound waves, like any other wave, lose energy as they travel due to several factors, including dispersion and energy dissipation. As a result, the intensity of the sound waves decreases as the distance from the source increases, making it more challenging for a listener to perceive the sound clearly. According to this explanation, as Sue continues to walk away from the ocean, the intensity of the sound waves she hears from the waves on the shore will gradually decrease. Consequently, her ability to hear these waves will be diminished, making it (A) harder for her to hear the waves on the shore.

However, the Arctic environment is not exclusive to these organisms, nor is it their primary habitat. II) Deserts Deserts are characterized by their arid and dry conditions, making them unsuitable habitats for plankton, nekton, and benthos. While some desert aquatic systems, such as oases or ephemeral rivers, may support limited aquatic life, this option would not be considered their primary habitat. III) Forests Although forests may contain bodies of water like lakes, rivers, and streams, these habitats alone would not be a primary location for plankton, nekton, and benthos. The majority of organisms found in forest ecosystems consist of terrestrial plants and animals rather than aquatic organisms. IV) In the oceans This is the correct answer. Plankton, nekton, and benthos predominantly reside in oceanic environments. Plankton refers to aquatic organisms that drift passively with water currents. They can be divided into two main groups: phytoplankton (photosynthesizing microscopic plants) and zooplankton (tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton or other zooplankton). Nekton includes more mobile and active aquatic creatures such as fish, squid, and marine mammals that can swim against currents or move independently. Benthos refers to organisms that live on, in, or near the ocean floor, such as crabs, clams, sea anemones, and various types of worms. In summary, plankton, nekton, and benthos primarily live in oceanic environments, making option (IV) the correct choice. Although some of these organisms can be found in other aquatic environments or ecosystems, the ocean is the primary habitat best suited for their survival and growth."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs. Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect more eggs hatch. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"To approach this task, we need to evaluate the impact of human interference on the bird's lifecycle mentioned in the process. Here's the step-by-step approach: 1) Understanding the scenario: The scenario details the life cycle of a bird, from laying eggs to the next generation of birds. We need to predict the effect of minimal human interference on the number of eggs hatching. 2) Considering biological factors: In a natural environment without human interference, birds will follow their normal lifecycle - laying eggs, the emergence of baby birds, their growth, finding a mate, nest-building, and laying eggs by the next generation. Essentially, birds have evolved to do this on their own. 3) Considering the impact of human interference: Human interference can have both negative and positive impacts on a bird’s life. On the negative side, it could lead to habitat destruction, disturbance during nesting, or even direct harm to the birds, which could decrease the chance of eggs hatching or the survival of the chicks. On the positive side, the human activity might involve providing safe nesting places, providing food, or protecting birds from predators, which could increase the chances of survival. 4) Thinking about reduced human interference, it is plausible that based on the positive impacts mentioned earlier, less human activity could potentially lead to a decline in the number of eggs hatching, since there would be less protection and aid given to the birds. However, decreasing human activity would also mean less of the negative impacts, like birds’ habitat destruction, and thus could potentially be beneficial for the birds. 5) Evaluating the likely outcome: This question is somewhat complex as it depends on the kind of human interference the bird populations are subjected to. If human interference majorly involves negative impacts like habitat destruction, less interference would mean more birds surviving and hence, more eggs hatching. Alternatively, if human interference is primarily protective, less interference could lead to fewer eggs hatching. However, since most wild birds have naturally evolved to survive without human assistance, and the negative human impact due to urbanization and deforestation is generally more widespread, it is likely that with very little human interference, the hatching of eggs for wild birds may increase.

The statement above discusses the comparison of outcomes between two models, the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model and the modified \\"Cam clay\\" model, in predicting soil behavior. These models are employed to analyze and predict the behavior of soil when it is unstructured or not organized in a specific manner. The \\"S-CLAY1\\" model is noted for its simplicity, which can be advantageous when attempting to develop a model that is easily understood and can generate reliable predictions without excessive complexity. This quality makes the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model an attractive option for soil behavior analysis and could contribute to the development of better soil management strategies. On the other hand, the modified \\"Cam clay\\" model is also a prominent choice when addressing soil behavior prediction. The \\"Cam clay\\" model is based on a mechanistic approach, taking into account the macroscopic behavior of soils and their microscopic composition, which may result in a more detailed and potentially, more accurate representation of the actual behavior of various soil types.

Write some highlights for the following article: Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown and got his girlfriend to pose as her so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. The married lover of a millionaire heiress murdered her before getting his dinner lady girlfriend to pose as the dead woman so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. Donald Graham murdered Janet Brown in 2005 and went on to steal £585,000 from her estate, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle and pay for sports cars. After killing Miss Brown, with whom he had been in a long relationship despite being married to someone else, Graham got a third woman to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Miss Brown's body has not been found. After murdering Miss Brown, Graham plundered the dead woman's savings and sold her assets - which he used to treat himself to a Ferrari, a Porsche and an Alfa Romeo. He then turned his greedy intentions on her elderly parents and started siphoning their cash, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Days after murdering Miss Brown, he met school dinner lady Elizabeth Todd and used some of the stolen money to buy her a house. When the killer's string of lies looked like they were about to unravel, Graham convinced Todd, who was today sentenced for fraud, to write two letters to Miss Brown's father's bank, posing as the dead woman, to request a cash transfer into his account. The 52-year-old mother, who lived in a council flat before she met Graham, also made two telephone calls under the guise of Miss Brown to a care home where a friend of hers worked and left messages under the dead woman's name in a bid to keep up the claim she was still alive. Miss Brown vanished in May 2005 and Graham convinced her friends and loved ones she had moved away abroad to start a new life. It was almost a decade later, after both of her parents died, that the sad truth of what happened to her emerged. Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for her murder. After killing Miss Brown (left), Graham got his girlfriend Elizabeth Todd (right) to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Todd, of Seaton Deleval, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. Judge John Evans sentenced her to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. The judge said: 'It is a tragic tale of repeated manipulation, naked exploitation, betrayal and greed which befell Janet Brown and ultimately her vulnerable parents at the hands of a ruthless killer. 'It ended with the untimely death, the cold-blooded murder, of Janet Brown. 'Your part in this appalling tale was, I accept, as do the crown, limited. 'It needs to be recognised, it is accepted you did not know the truth about Janet. Had you done so, had that been established, I would have had to approach the question of sentence on a very different basis.' Judge Evans said he accepted Todd was 'vulnerable and naïve' when she 'blindly carried out his directions'. Glen Gatland, defending, said Todd could have been preyed on by the callous killer because of her physical resemblance to Miss Brown. Mr Gatland said: 'There is evidence he tired to persuade Elizabeth Todd, very shortly after their first meetings, to have her hair dyed to the same colour.' The court heard Todd believed Graham, who would profess his 'love and devotion' to her, would one day marry her - a belief that was backed up when he bought two engagement rings. Mr Gatland added: 'He was a very, very skillful conman, he was able to lead Elizabeth Todd up the garden path. He is skillful at using women. 'Elizabeth Todd believed Janet Brown was overseas and working. She genuinely believed what Donald Graham was telling her.' Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for Miss Brown's murder. Graham, 60, who lived with his wife Denise, sent letters and cards to Miss Brown's parents after he killed her, claiming to be Janet and telling them she had settled in Europe. He then went about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. After the death of Janet's mother, Graham even took her father shopping each week while defrauding the family of hundreds of thousands of pounds. During the murder trial, the court heard he created a fake will for Janet's elderly father Eric Brown, which would leave his estate - Plane Trees Estate, in Hexham, Northumberland, to Graham. Eric Brown's will originally left all of his assets to Janet, but in the circumstance that he outlived her everything would be left to the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity. The court how Janet Brown and Elizabeth Todd had both been listed as witnesses on the fake will in which Graham forged Eric Browns signature. Skipton Building Society noticed suspicious activity on Eric Brown's account in 2009 and stopped the transaction of a cheque from Eric Brown to Donald Graham's account. This led to Graham writing letters to the bank claiming to be Eric and Janet Brown, although they were both dead. Todd admitted writing two of the letters, claiming to be Miss Brown and requesting cash be transferred immediately. When Graham was interviewed by police he claimed he was the joint executor of Eric Brown's will with Janet Brown. Donald Graham, of Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, was charged with 19 offences in September 13, 2013, nearly four years after the investigation began. He was charged with murder, two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, 13 counts of fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud and perverting the course of justice. Todd pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice and was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) He first appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on September 17 2013 and pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 10 2014. Graham changed his plea on March 14 and admitted 18 fraud offences against Janet Brown and her parents. He denied murder and preventing the course of justice but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court found him guilty of both counts on June 19. The total amount that Graham gained during the fraud was £585,000. Janet Brown lived with her elderly parents Olive and Eric Brown in a converted barn on her parents estate Plane Trees Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland. She had been planning to go on holiday in June 2005 to France with Graham, her lover of eight years. Graham cancelled at the last minute falsely claiming his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Janet told a friend that Graham had 'let her down'. However Graham had secretly met another girlfriend - Todd - and was no longer interested in Janet Brown, only her finances. Janet disappeared before she went on holiday and has not been seen since.","completion":"- Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown in 2005 and stole £585,000 from her estate to fund his lavish lifestyle. - Graham convinced Elizabeth Todd, his girlfriend, to pose as the deceased Janet Brown and defraud even more money from her family. - Janet Brown's body has never been found and her disappearance remained a mystery for almost a decade after her death. - Elizabeth Todd was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision after pleading guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. - Graham is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 32 years for the murder of Janet Brown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

If more air is entering the bronchial tissue, this could indicate a larger volume of air is being inhaled, possibly through deeper breaths or an increased respiratory rate. 2. Air passes through the lungs: After entering the mouth, air travels through the trachea and into the bronchial tubes, which branch off into smaller airways called bronchioles. These bronchioles eventually lead to tiny, balloon-like structures called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which is where gas exchange occurs. If more air is present in the bronchial tissue, it suggests that more inhaled air is reaching the alveoli, which could potentially allow for a greater amount of oxygen to cross the alveolar membrane into the capillaries. 3. Carbon dioxide is removed: In the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the inhaled air into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled. The increased air in the bronchial tissue could mean that there is a larger amount of residual air left in the alveoli after exhalation, which may increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air sacs, subsequently making it more challenging for carbon dioxide to be expelled. 4. The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body: Oxygen that has entered the bloodstream binds with hemoglobin in red blood cells, which are then transported to cells throughout the body by the circulatory system. If more oxygen is available in the alveoli due to the increased air in the bronchial tissue, this could theoretically lead to a greater saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, thereby delivering more oxygen to the tissues and organs. In conclusion, the perturbation of more air entering the bronchial tissue could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The direct effect would be the increased oxygen availability in the alveoli, which may lead to greater oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. However, there could also be indirect consequences, such as a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli, which could make it more difficult for the body to expel carbon dioxide. It would be important to consider how the individual's respiratory and circulatory systems respond to these changes and adapt to maintain a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"cell division is how organisms grow and repair themselves\\" and \\"mitosis is cell division\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? OPTIONS: (I). complex. (II). gametes. (III). recycling. (IV). mechanical. (V). Microscope. (VI). mitosis. (VII). meiosis. (VIII). atoms. The answer is:","completion":"(VI). mitosis. Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can gather that the process by which organisms grow and repair themselves is cell division, and that mitosis is a type of cell division. To briefly explain further, mitosis is the process where the nucleus of a cell is divided into two identical nuclei, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell. This process involves several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes condense, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate, and the spindle fibers attach to the centromeres. In anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers towards opposite poles. Finally, during telophase, the separated chromatids reach the poles, the nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of newly-forming sister chromatids, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil, eventually completing the mitosis process. One key function of mitosis is growth, which occurs as the number of cells within an organism increases. New cells are created through mitosis to replace old or damaged ones, which in turn helps repair tissues and organs in the body. This process is crucial for the continuous growth and development of organisms, as well as for the maintenance of their overall health and well-being. In contrast, meiosis is another type of cell division that produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell (gametes). This process is essential for the formation of sex cells during sexual reproduction, ensuring that the offspring maintain the correct number of chromosomes when the sperm and egg cells unite. However, it is not related to the growth and repair of organisms, which is why the teacher specifically pointed out mitosis as the answer. Given the information provided by the teacher, the best answer to the quiz question \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\" is (VI). mitosis, as it directly relates to the growth and repair processes in organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.

The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album. In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \\"Sad Song\\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts. The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \\"Sad Song\\", was released to radio stations March 1. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. Though the Cars have not broken up, they have been inactive since the tour's conclusion in 2011, and their website has not been updated since that time. Though on April 28, 2016 Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q & A with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 has also seen a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl. Ocasek supervised the remastering. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What can you tell me about the album \\"Move Like This\\"?","completion":"The album \\"Move Like This\\" is by The Cars, an American rock band.

After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp, Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing. Delgadillo retreats to a warehouse in Los Angeles where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported cocaine stamped with the gang's brand name \\"Fatal Beauty\\". One worker, however, has been sampling too much of the drug and, in his intoxicated state, prepares envelopes with a fatally high concentration of cocaine and a misaligned stamp. Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner (Brad Dourif and Mike Jolly) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product.Back at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss, Lt. Kellerman (John P. Ryan), for ruining the bust when he receives a call in which Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made.

Answer the following question: Process: - The thermostat senses that the temperature has dropped - A signal is sent to the heating system - Heating oil travels from the tank to the burner - The oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The oil/air combination is injected into the burner - The burner is ignited in the combustion chamber - The furnace heats the air - The blower sends the heated air through the ducts - The heated air comes out the vents and into the room. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more heat in the furnace happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to an increase in heat within the furnace beyond its usual operating temperature. If more heat is generated in the furnace, it may potentially have various effects on the overall heating process for the house. 1. Direct effect: If the furnace produces more heat, the air being heated within the furnace will reach higher temperatures. As a result, the blower will distribute this warmer air throughout the ducts, which will eventually exit through the vents into the room. This warmer air may lead to a quicker increase in the room temperature. However, this would only be more effective up to a certain point, as an overheated furnace can pose safety risks and damage the system. 2. Indirect effect: While an increase in heat generation within the furnace may initially contribute to more heat for the house, it could eventually lead to several negative consequences. Overheating can cause components within the furnace to wear out or malfunction sooner, which could ultimately decrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the heating system. Additionally, an overheated furnace can pose a fire hazard and compromise the safety of the occupants. 3. Thermostat control: The thermostat is designed to sense when the desired temperature has been reached and send a signal to the heating system to stop producing more heat. If the furnace is generating more heat than needed, the thermostat will work to regulate the system and maintain the desired temperature in the room. This implies that even if more heat is produced in the furnace, the thermostat will counteract this excessive heat generation to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more heat in the furnace may have a direct positive effect on the heating process for the house up to a certain point. However, it also has potential indirect effects, such as damaging the heating system components or posing safety risks. Therefore, it's important to ensure proper furnace maintenance and operation to avoid these issues and maintain an effective and efficient heating system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person that drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments? is inside the article: The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality. For this reason, they speculated that had Hendrix been convicted it would have ended his music career.

It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest. I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.

The reviewer makes it abundantly clear from the start that they did not enjoy the movie, using strong words like 'horribly boring' and 'completely unoriginal' to express their dissatisfaction. There is a palpable frustration in the way that they talk about the acting, pointing out that most of the cast consisted of forgotten actors, which they found disappointing. The critic also criticizes the story, implying a lack of creativity on the part of the filmmakers. They have a particular gripe with the director of the movie, suggesting that he should stick to acting, rather than directing, indicating that they think his directing skills are subpar. They do give minimal praise to Fred Durst saying he seemed better than the rest of the cast, however this brief positive comment is outweighed by their overarching negative view of the film. When speaking of the execution they call it 'a weak example of what bad cinema looks like', which further emphasizes their disapproval.

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

Would \\"In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ), or expected value.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Standard deviation, represented by the symbol sigma (σ), is a key concept in statistics and probability theory. It is a measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from their mean (average) value. In simpler terms, the standard deviation helps to determine the spread of data points in a dataset and provides an insight into its overall consistency. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely packed around the mean, whereas a large standard deviation suggests that the data points are more dispersed. The answer provided, \\"In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average (mean), or expected value,\\" is indeed a reasonable response as it encapsulates the basic definition of standard deviation. However, to better understand the importance and application of this concept, it is essential to delve into further detail. Standard deviation is typically calculated using the following steps: 1. Compute the mean (average) of the dataset. 2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result. This calculates the squared difference for each data point. 3. Find the average of these squared differences. This is called the variance. 4. Take the square root of the variance, resulting in the standard deviation. There are two primary types of standard deviations – population standard deviation and sample standard deviation. - Population standard deviation applies to the complete dataset and is a fixed parameter that does not depend on the sample chosen. It is generally denoted by the lowercase Greek letter sigma (σ). - Sample standard deviation, on the other hand, is an estimate of the population standard deviation derived from a specific sample of the dataset. It is generally represented by the lowercase letter s. Standard deviation is an essential tool for statisticians and researchers as it allows them to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample. It is used in various contexts, such as hypothesis testing, quality control, finance, and investment analysis, to name a few. The concept enables analysts to gauge the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with a particular dataset, ultimately aiding in the interpretation of results and decision-making processes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on July 9, 1937, in Bradford, England, Hockney is one of the most influential British artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Although he gained prominence as one of the pioneers of the British Pop Art movement in the early 1960s, Hockney's work spans a diverse range of styles, media, and subject matters. David Hockney studied at the Bradford College of Art from 1953 to 1957 before moving on to the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London from 1959 to 1962. Alongside fellow students at the RCA, such as Ron Kitaj, R. B. Kitaj, and Peter Blake, Hockney began exploring popular culture's impact on art. As a result, he became one of the key figures of British Pop Art, a movement characterized by its critique of consumer culture, embrace of mass-produced imagery, and the challenge it posed to established artistic norms. Returning down to the painting, \\"Bertha and Bernie\\" is an oil on canvas work with dimensions measuring 60x48 inches. It showcases Hockney's signature style of portraying subjects in bright and vibrant colors. The painting features two prominent figures, presumably Bertha and Bernie, depicted in Hockney's playful and whimsical Pop Art framing. Over the years, David Hockney has experimented with numerous styles, like Realism, Abstract Expressionism, and Cubism, before developing his iconic style that harmoniously blends reality and abstraction. Although his work is highly varied, Hockney's paintings often convey the essence of two main themes: intimate moments and the relationships between individuals. As a prolific artist, David Hockney's work not only spans paintings but also drawings, printmaking, stage design, photography, and digital media. Some of his most famous works include \\"A Bigger Splash\\" (1967) and \\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\\" (1972), which was auctioned for a record-breaking 90.3 million in 2018. Furthermore, his extensive career has contributed to the recognition and validation of the Pop Art movement, making him one of the most influential and important artists in modern history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Linus, however, considers it a good idea and encourages him despite the jeers of Lucy, Violet, and Patty (\\"Failure Face\\"). \\"Snoopy's Harp\\" Charlie Brown nervously enters the spelling bee, and he defeats the other children in his class when he spells insecure, a word he considers his trademark. As Charlie Brown studies for the school championship, he and Linus sing a spelling mnemonic (\\"I Before E\\") as Snoopy accompanies them on a Jew's harp. In class the next day, Charlie Brown freezes when challenged with perceive, but he recovers when Snoopy plays the song's accompaniment outside the school. Crowned champion, the other kids cheerfully follow him home and sing (\\"Champion Charlie Brown\\"). Lucy proclaims herself his agent, and when his friends suggest that he continue studying, he is confused.

Let's examine them step by step to see their differences. 1. To what extent has Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire stood the test of time? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the endurance and relevance of Gibbon's work. - Specifically, it interrogates whether the book's historical analysis, arguments, and presentation still hold up today. - It asks if the book's content remains valid and useful for understanding the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. 2. Is it worthwhile, in this day and age, to read The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the personal or educational value of reading Gibbon's work. - It asks if the book would be an appropriate or useful use of time for a modern reader. - It takes the modern perspective into account, considering if there are other, more relevant or more accessible resources available to study the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

Review: Let me start out by saying that I love Mary Balogh's writing, but no one bats a hundred every time.The story started out well enough. However, the female protagonist turned into some sort of psychologically and emotionally suicidal neurotic ultra-feminist. It was as if she wanted to punish the guy who loved her because of society's standards.There were many moments towards the end of the book that I thought someone should smack some sense into this girl. I also couldn't understand how the two characters possibly fell in love. They hardly spoke to or spent time with one another. It was all just too weird.I've never gotten past the third chapter of a book and not finish it, but I did this time. I just couldn't torture myself any longer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

A new law in Nebraska which dictates that you cannot have an abortion after 20 weeks meant Deaver had no choice but to have her baby. With her husband, Robb, the couple waited ten days until she was able to give birth to baby Elizabeth. The couple cradled and comforted their baby for 15 minutes before she died. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Heartbreaking Story of Woman Denied Abortion Under Nebraska's New Law Subtitle: Danielle Deaver Forced to Deliver Doomed Baby under Controversial Legislation In a tragic case that has reignited the debate on abortion rights in the United States, 34-year-old Danielle Deaver was denied an abortion after her waters broke at just 22 weeks, forcing her to carry her baby to full term, who ultimately survived for only 15 minutes after being born. The reason behind this heart-wrenching decision was Nebraska's new 20-week abortion ban, which left Deaver with no choice but to endure the devastating outcome. The doctors informed Danielle Deaver that her baby had no chance of survival after her amniotic sac ruptured at 22 weeks, leaving the fetus without the necessary protection and nourishing fluid to develop in the womb. In the past, medical professionals would have recommended an abortion in such cases, given the cruelty of making the mother and child suffer through an event that would ultimately culminate in the heartache of death. However, Nebraska's recent law change meant that Deaver's hands were tied, and she could not terminate her pregnancy after the 20-week mark. With the support of her husband Robb, Deaver spent the next ten agonizing days waiting to deliver her child, knowing that there was no hope of survival. In an interview, Robb commented about how they knew their baby would not live, and they tried preparing themselves for the moment that would come. The couple's worst fears were realized when Danielle gave birth to their baby girl, Elizabeth, who survived for a brief 15 minutes cuddled in her parents' arms before passing away. This tragic story raises several pressing questions not just about Nebraska's abortion laws but also regarding reproductive rights in the United States as a whole. The 20-week ban enacted in Nebraska, known as the \\"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\\" has been challenged by many in the medical and legal fields who believe that it is fundamentally flawed. Critics argue that the law fails to take into account exceptional circumstances, such as those experienced by the Deaver family, which result in the prolonged suffering of both mother and baby. Furthermore, opinions on when a fetus can feel pain remain divided among experts, leading some to view the time limit as arbitrary. In a country where debate rages over abortion accessibility and a woman's right to choose, Danielle Deaver's heartrending experience serves as a painful reminder of the consequences legislation can have on the lives of real people. As lawmakers continue to grapple with contentious issues surrounding reproductive rights, stories like this one put a human face on the impact that such regulations have on families and their personal journeys. One cannot help but question if rigid laws should be the final arbiter in deeply complex and individual cases such as Deaver's. What remains certain, however, is that the ripples from this tragic case will continue to be felt in the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights and the ethical considerations of abortion laws in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids. - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes. Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip. - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences. - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805. - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae).

Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others. Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the filmâthe idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes. After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it. The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared.

Please answer the following question: Dear Mr. Wolfson, The purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator . I have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it. I thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event! I urge you to correct that omission now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community. Sincerely, Linda Sullivan What can we learn about Mr.Wolfson from the letter? A) He knows Linda quite well. B) He is a careless person.

But today, a story with longer-term consequences takes center stage: U.S. relations with China. In the Oval Office at 10:00 am ET and 11:00 am, President Obama holds bilateral meetings with Chinese President Hu for the Chinese leader’s official state visit. At 12:20 pm, Obama and Hu meet with prominent U.S. and Chinese business leaders. Less than an hour later, at 1:05 pm, Obama and Hu hold a joint news conference. And in the evening, the state dinner honoring Hu gets underway. *** Little leverage: NBC’s Andrea Mitchell notes that the U.S. has very little leverage in today’s talks with Hu. In recent months, the United States has been borrowing 4 billion a day to finance the budget deficit -- HALF of which is now provided every day by China. At the same time, China has to worry about its own inflation problems, U.S. officials tell Mitchell. And as the holder of all that debt, the last thing China wants is for the U.S. economy to fall back into recession, or worse. A major concern here is that Hu has diminished authority -- unlike past Chinese leaders -- and that the real power lies with the military. Our take on today’s state visit: It has become another foreign-policy event that Obama has tried to turn into an economic story (just consider today’s CEO meet-and-greet at 12:20 pm). In fact, the economic part is more important than the strategic part. Many Americans may be watching today's events asking: is China an ally or an adversary or both? Our answer: exactly. It's a complicated relationship where there's still a lot of cultural distrust that needs to be overcome. *** Stepping on the repeal story: It’s also worth pointing out how today’s state visit has stepped on the health-repeal story. Last week, and especially before Arizona, the GOP effort to repeal Obama’s signature health-care law would have been the dominating political story. Now? It’s not being watched as closely -- due to Arizona, the China story, and also the fact that repeal is unlikely going anywhere in the Senate. The Washington Post also makes this point: The House’s current debate over health care is much more civil than it was a year ago. “This time around, there were no frightening warnings about ‘death panels’ for the elderly or a ‘holocaust’ of uninsured Americans.” The final vote on the repeal effort is expected around 5:00 pm to 5:30 pm ET, NBC's Luke Russert says, and the measure is certain to pass given the GOP’s majority. http://wapo.st/gdMcz6 *** NBC/WSJ poll day! How do Americans view China (vs. the U.S.)? What are their thoughts on the health law and the GOP effort to repeal it? And how do they see President Obama after the Arizona shootings and Congress’ lame-duck achievements? Well, look for the answers in our latest NBC/WSJ poll, which comes out at 6:30 pm ET. *** Why Manitowoc? Yesterday, the White House announced that Obama would travel to Manitowoc, WI the day after his State of the Union address. Why Manitowoc? Consider that Obama captured 53% of the vote in this county in the 2008 general election. But last year, victorious Republicans Scott Walker (in the governor’s race) and Ron Johnson (in the Senate contest) won, respectively, 60% and 58% in Manitowoc. This isn't that friendly of a county for the president; it's arguably GOP leaning since Obama's percentage in the county in 2008 underperformed his percentage in the state (56%) by three points. *** End of a Senate era: The most striking part about the news yesterday that both Sens. Joe Lieberman (I) and Kent Conrad (D) would be retiring at the end of this Congress wasn't the politics, though we'll dig into that in a minute. Instead, especially for those of us who started covering politics in the '90s, it was yet another reminder that a Senate era is ending. Consider this list of senators who have retired, lost, or died since 2008: Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Ted Stevens, Arlen Specter, John Warner, Chris Dodd, Kit Bond, even Joe Biden. And when you add Lieberman and Conrad to that list, that's a combined 335 years of Senate service. *** Lieberman’s tough re-election path: As for the politics of Lieberman’s retirement -- which he’ll announce at 12:30 pm ET in Stamford, CT -- his path to victory would have been extremely difficult. He could have run for re-election as a Democrat, but would have faced a primary challenge from the left, and we saw how that played out in 2006 (with Ned Lamont defeating him). He could have, as he did after his primary loss, run as an independent. But remember that Lieberman was able to pull off that victory because the GOP nominee (Alan Schlesinger) got just 10% of the vote. “He believes that if he were to run for re-election it’d be a tough fight,” aide Marshall Wittmann told the New York Times. “He’s confident he could’ve won that fight.” Yet this is also perhaps a fitting time for Lieberman to announce the end of his Senate career. After disappointing his party -- on Iraq, for endorsing John McCain, for criticizing Obama at the GOP convention -- the Connecticut senator stewarded the passage of a top Democratic priority: repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” *** Here’s a conversation starter: The last three unsuccessful VP nominees have been Sarah Palin. John Edwards, and Joe Lieberman. Discuss. (Hat tip: Walter Shapiro.) *** A tale of two retirements: Speaking of retirements… Last week, Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R) announced she was retiring. The actual impact on 2012: Unless something shocking happens, a Republican (possibly Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst) will hold on to the seat, especially in a presidential year. But when North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad (D) said yesterday that he wasn’t running for re-election in 2012, that has a MUCH bigger impact. The reason: It’s unclear if Democrats will be able win this open seat, especially in a state where Obama won just 45% of the vote in ’08. Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg Political Reports says that the GOP starts out with the early advantage. “Republicans have to be considered the favorites to take over the seat,” he said. The good news for Democrats -- the GOP no longer has a John Hoeven waiting in the wings. While Lieberman, Conrad, and KBH are retiring, one longtime senator isn’t: Dick Lugar (R), who might have to fend off a Tea Party primary challenge. http://wapo.st/i7JjpC *** Harry Reid’s new challenge: Here’s one final point about Lieberman’s retirement: Since he’s not running for re-election, this means he’s a total free agent on legislative matters. A new challenge for Harry Reid? *** Boehner’s absence: As we mentioned above, Obama tonight is holding a state dinner with President Hu of China tonight. But guess who’s not coming to the Hu dinner: newly installed House Speaker John Boehner. The move has raised eyebrows for some, especially after Boehner turned down a ride on Air Force One to go to Tucson, and after Republican congressional leaders wanted a later date for their post-election meeting with Obama. In fairness, Boehner will meet with Hu to have a substantive meeting this week on Capitol Hill, according to Boehner aide Michael Steel. On turning down the ride on Air Force One, Boehner was tending to duties as speaker -- a bipartisan prayer service, for example -- that kept him from jumping on that flight. And it's also true that Boehner rarely, if ever, attends state dinners. But the question becomes whether the speaker, who’s second in line in presidential succession, has a greater responsibility to appear at these kind of events. NBC's Mitchell notes that Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker during the second Clinton term, was very present at the state dinner for Ziang Zemin -- the last state visit for a Chinese leader. *** Trumka on 2012: AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is addressing the National Press Club this morning. Here’s an excerpt of Trumka’s remarks: “Last year’s election was fundamentally about jobs, and I believe the 2012 election will be fundamentally about jobs. America wants to work. People who live in Wonderland may not have noticed, but there is a lot of work to be done here. While one in five construction workers is looking for work, we have a 2.2 trillion old-school infrastructure deficit. We need to invest trillions more to build the 21st century infrastructure necessary for our nation’s and our planet’s future—high-speed mass transit, smart utilities and universal high-speed broadband.” Countdown Chicago’s mayoral election: 34 days Countdown to Election Day 2011: 293 days Countdown to the Iowa caucuses: 383 days * Note: When the IA caucuses take place depends on whether other states move up Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are taking a pass on the black-tie event at the White House. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, a critic of China’s human-rights policy, plans to go to the state dinner, the first for a Chinese leader in more than 13 years. All three no-shows, through their aides, cited scheduling conflicts. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who has called the Chinese president “a dictator,” are to meet Hu at the Capitol tomorrow. “I look forward to the meeting,” Boehner told reporters today. If Hu or Obama had concerns about the leaders’ decisions to stay away, neither would say. At a news conference, Hu deferred a question on the matter to Obama, saying the president was “in a better position to answer.” Obama never did. Lawmakers in both political parties have been making hostile statements and proposing tough economic measures against China, including legislation to let the U.S. government impose duties on the nation for undervaluing its currency. Scoring With Voters Political messages critical of China scored high with voters during last year’s congressional campaign, said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who researched the issue while advising candidates. “There’s no question that the American public looks at China as very much a serious competitor -- it’s not quite an enemy, but it’s a competitor -- and Americans are very wary of China these days,” he said. Mellman, who has advised Reid, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and numerous House members, said virtually every candidate he worked with last year touched on the issue in some way. Hu’s visit is focused on economic ties between the two countries, including more than 400 billion in annual trade, as well as differences over human rights, China’s enforcement of intellectual-property rights and what U.S. officials say is the artificially low value of the yuan. Higher Import Duties Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in a letter this week that they will try to revive House-passed legislation to let U.S. businesses seek higher duties on some Chinese imports to offset any advantage from an undervalued currency. The bill died in the Senate last year. At the same time, lawmakers preparing to receive Hu at the Capitol tomorrow are making it clear that the Chinese president is no friend. “He is a dictator,” Reid told a Las Vegas television station yesterday. “He can do a lot of things through the form of government they have. Maybe I shouldn’t have said ‘dictator,’ but they have a different type of government than we have, and that is an understatement.” Republicans and Democrats hammered at China during a briefing by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, a longtime critic of China’s human-rights record, called Hu an “oppressor” and a “murderer,” questioning why Obama was giving a respectful welcome to “a monstrous regime.” ‘World Domination’ Democratic Representative Albio Sires of New Jersey said China was seeking “world domination.” New Jersey Republican Representative Chris Smith suggested that Hu should be brought before an international criminal tribunal instead of feted at the White House. The remarks were in contrast to the scene today at the executive mansion, where Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Hu with an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn. Obama said the U.S. and China “have an enormous stake in each other’s success.” Hu said, “Our cooperation as partners should be based on mutual respect.” Lawmakers’ slights of Hu may add to distrust between the two nations, said Dan Mahaffee, an expert on China at the Washington-based Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. “It sends an unfortunate message that at a time of competition between the two countries, that American politicians are busy looking inward,” Mahaffee said, adding that lawmakers are playing to public fears. Pew Survey A January survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 53 percent of Americans said it was important for the U.S. to get tougher with China on trade and economic issues. One in five, or 20 percent, said China posed the greatest threat to the U.S. of any country, up from 11 percent in November 2009. “Local pressure at the district translates up,” Mahaffee said. Dozens of congressional candidates aired television advertisements last year seizing on the theme. In one, Reid called his Tea Party-supported Republican opponent Sharron Angle “a foreign worker’s best friend,” and said she backed tax breaks for “outsourcing to China and India.” Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California made similar charges against her Republican rival, former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina, saying she shipped jobs “to Shanghai instead of San Jose.” Chinese Wind Turbines Republicans hit on the theme too. In a spot set to Chinese- sounding music, candidate Spike Maynard slammed Democratic Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia for backing Obama’s economic-stimulus law, saying it helped fund projects powered by Chinese-made wind turbines. “Only a politician who’s been in Washington 34 years would vote to help foreign companies create Chinese jobs making windmills,” said the advertisement, which featured pictures of Mao Zedong, the communist revolutionary who ruled the People’s Republic of China from its founding in 1949 to his death in 1976. Reid and Boxer won re-election; Maynard lost. The potency of China as a campaign theme was clear, said Clayton Dube, who leads the University of Southern California’s U.S.-China Institute in Los Angeles. “Part of it is a genuine worry that the United States is being victimized by an all-powerful Chinese government,” Dube said. “The notion that things are not fair is a very powerful one. It resonates with Americans all the time, particularly in hard times.” To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Hirschfeld Davis in Washington at jdavis159@bloomberg.net; Lisa Lerer in Washington at llerer@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Silva at msilva34@bloomberg.net ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The article talks about a special meeting between the leaders of the United States and China.

Bozz has no desire to go to war and acts like it. Even though his weekend leave is withdrawn he still goes to town and ends up going to a hotel room with two girls and fellow soldier Paxton (Matthew Davis). Bozz and Paxton make friends despite their different outlooks; Paxton has enlisted for service and wants to go to Nam for the experience.At the base, while Bozz shows that he is capable of being a good soldier when he wants to, he continues to attract disciplinary penalties as well as the anger of fellow privates, especially one named Wilson (Shea Whigham).

Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What is probably true about the author?

Sentence 1: How about you guys, are you in a house apartment or a house? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house. Sentence 2: Do you live in a single-family home or in an apartment? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a single-family home (which is essentially a house) or an apartment. Now, let's consider the question and the options: Question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? The first sentence being true means that the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house. Now, let's examine the possibilities for each option: Option 1: Yes - If the person(s) live in a house or an apartment, this would mean the second sentence asking \\"Do you live in a single-family home or an apartment?\\" could also be true since a house can be considered a single-family home. Option 2: It is not possible to tell - At first glance, this option may seem plausible since the first sentence asks about living in a \\"house apartment,\\" a term that is not widely used.

Option 3: No - This option indicates that the second sentence would not be true if the first sentence is true. However, since both sentences essentially ask about living in a house or an apartment, it makes sense that if the first statement holds true, the second should as well. Based on the comparison of the sentences and the options, the most accurate answer to the question, \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" would be: Option 1: Yes"},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Worsted (or ) is a high-quality type of wool yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the English county of Norfolk. That village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, formed a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century, when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds. In the same period, many weavers from Flanders moved to Norfolk. \\"Worsted\\" yarns/fabrics are distinct from woollens (though both are made from sheep's wool): the former is considered stronger, finer, smoother, and harder than the latter. - Aylsham is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Bure in north Norfolk, England, about north of Norwich. The river rises near Melton Constable, upstream from Aylsham and continues to Great Yarmouth and the North Sea, although it was only made navigable after 1779, allowing grain, coal and timber to be brought up river. - Gautam Hari Singhania (born 9 September 1965) is an Indian Industrialist.

The latter, disparaged as \\"Mr Nyet\\" in the West, had served for 28 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Gromyko was relegated to the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (officially Soviet Head of State), as he was considered an \\"old thinker.\\" Also on July 1, Gorbachev took the opportunity to dispose of his main rival by removing Grigory Romanov from the Politburo, and brought Boris Yeltsin and Lev Zaikov into the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat.

On July 1, 1985, Gorbachev promoted Eduard Shevardnadze to a full member of the Politburo."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: According to the passage, which statement is true? Options: A: In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa. B: Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel. C: China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat. D: Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people.

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking. Stopping at benches, I would rest until I could muster more energy. Question: Why was the air cool and prepped with moisture? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The air was cool and peppered with moisture because the protagonist was close to the ocean. Coastal regions often experience cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels due to the presence of large bodies of water. This is because water has a high heat capacity, allowing it to absorb and release heat slowly, which results in a moderating effect on temperature. Additionally, the evaporation of water from the ocean adds moisture to the air, creating a damp and cool atmosphere. As the protagonist noted their proximity to the ocean, it is evident that these coastal factors contributed to the cool and moist air they experienced in Boston."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. Context: After leaving the position as the Padres' President, Lucchino became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox on November 15, 2001 and hired Epstein to work under him. At the end of the 2002 season, Lucchino appointed Epstein to replace interim general manager (GM) Mike Port. Epstein is credited with initiating the trade of Nomar Garciaparra and making key contract acquisitions including those of Kevin Millar and Curt Schilling during his first tenure as Red Sox GM. The new players were regarded as instrumental in breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. It was the Red Sox' first World Series championship since 1918, ending what remains the third longest championship drought in the history of any Major League team, after the Chicago White Sox (1917-2005) and the Chicago Cubs (1908-2016). On October 31, 2005, Epstein resigned, rejecting a three-year, 1.5-million-per-year contract for personal reasons. According to The Boston Globe, \\"This is a job you have to give your whole heart and soul to\\", he said. \\"In the end, after a long period of reflection about myself and the program, I decided I could no longer put my whole heart and soul into it.\\" Because it was Halloween the night he resigned from the Red Sox, Epstein left Fenway Park wearing a gorilla suit in an attempt to avoid reporters. A witness reported spotting a person wearing a gorilla suit driving a Volvo similar to Epstein's that night. The suit was loaned to him and was later auctioned for 11,000. The money raised was given to The Jimmy Fund and the Foundation to be Named Later (FTBNL). Epstein remained in contact with the team's front office and on January 12, 2006, he and Red Sox management announced his return. Six days later, the team announced that he would resume the title of general manager and add the title of executive vice president. In November 2007, Epstein announced, at the annual general manager meeting, that he had signed a new contract with the Red Sox but declined to disclose the terms of the deal. In December 2007, Epstein was mentioned in the Mitchell Report regarding a November 2006 email exchange he had had with Red Sox scout Marc DelPiano on the possible acquisition of closer Eric Gagne. In the email, Epstein asked DelPiano, \\"Have you done any digging on Gagne? I know the Dodgers think he was a steroid guy. Maybe so. What do you hear on his medical?\\" DelPiano replied that \\"steroids IS the issue\\" with Gagne, questioned his \\"poise and commitment\\" and expressed questions about his durability \\"without steroid help.\\" Despite DelPiano's reservations about Gagne, Epstein traded Kason Gabbard and minor league outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre to the Texas Rangers for Gagne on July 31, 2007. Question: Was there anything else interesting in this article about the red sox? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are a few more interesting things in this article about the Red Sox.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million.

This is accompanied by low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak. Now answer this question: What is the nutitional value to humans of poultry and poultry products?","completion":"Poultry and poultry products offer significant nutritional value to humans, making them an essential part of many diets around the world. Poultry meat, specifically chicken, and eggs are particularly beneficial due to their high-quality protein content. Proteins are essential for the body as they are the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. They play a vital role in body functions such as the formation of enzymes and hormones, muscle repair, and maintaining immune health. In a 100-gram serving of baked chicken – boneless and skinless – there is roughly 31 grams of protein. This amount of protein would provide approximately 62% of the daily recommended intake for an average female, and about 51% for an average male. This high protein-content can contribute to satiety, weight management, and muscle growth and repair, confirming poultry meat as a beneficial dietary component. In addition to protein, poultry meat also contains low levels of fat, with a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains, on a weight basis, about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat. Polyunsaturated fats are considered healthier fats and include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential for the body. These fats help lower levels of LDL cholesterol (the \\"bad\\" cholesterol), reduce inflammation, and may reduce the risk of heart disease. However, it is also worth noting that not all parts of the chicken have the same nutritional value. For instance, boneless, skinless chicken breast has much lower fat content, with only 4 grams of fat per 100-gram serving, compared to other parts with skin or cooking methods with added oils or fats. Eggs produced by poultry are also nutritionally rich. They are an affordable, accessible protein source and contain a variety of vitamins and minerals essential for health. These include Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and iron. Plus, eggs are one of the few food sources of choline, a nutrient that's essential for brain development. In conclusion, the nutritional value to humans of poultry and poultry products is substantial. Their high-quality protein, low and favourable fat content, and the plethora of vital vitamins and minerals found within them make them an essential part of a balanced diet. They contribute to maintaining and building body tissues, managing weight, supporting brain development and heart health, among other functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As part of a diverse team of scientists, Walker takes the responsibility to study the possibility of extraterrestrial life in this unique geological formation. Little do they know the truth about the crater. Walker is a dedicated scientist with a curious mind, but he also has a deep personal connection to the search for extraterrestrial life. His mother, who was his source of inspiration, disappeared while working on a classified government project on extraterrestrial signals. Walker has since been obsessively searching for any clues regarding her disappearance. As the team settles into their research camp near the crater, they are met by Sayida Awad, a local anthropologist, who has knowledge about the crater's history and the unexplained phenomena that have been reported by the natives. Strange stories of missing people and mysterious lights over the crater fascinate and intrigue the team, but they initially dismiss them as superstitions and folklore. Act 2: Walker and the team descend into the depths of the crater equipped with the latest scientific equipment. The deeper the team goes, the stranger things become. Unexplainable magnetic fields, bizarre radio signals, and peculiar luminescent organisms are some of the findings they come across. One night, while examining the anomalous radio signals, Walker starts to receive cryptic messages in his mother's voice, urging him to follow the trail and venture deeper into the crate. The messages leave Walker both distraught and determined. He hides this information from the rest of the team, fearing they may think he is losing his sanity. Despite being warned by Sayida and experiencing the strange occurrences plaguing the team members, Walker becomes obsessed by the quest. His determination to find the truth behind his mother's disappearance forms a fierce internal conflict between his scientific perspective and the unfathomable unknown. Act 3: As the team prepares to leave the crater due to lack of significant findings and continuous inexplicable occurrences, Walker secretly decides to stay behind and investigate further. As night falls, he feels an irresistible pull towards the crater's center. He can no longer resist the calling, and heads towards the source. On reaching the heart of the crater, Walker discovers a concealed and technologically advanced underground alien base. He gathers up his courage and walks inside, trying to unravel the alien technology and understanding their mission. Walker comes across a room where he finds his mother in a state of suspended animation. He realizes that she has been kept alive by the aliens for her knowledge on extraterrestrial signals. The aliens, who have been observing Walker all this time, finally reveal themselves. They explain that they abducted his mother to utilize her expertise to communicate with their home planet. They have been stranded on Earth after their spaceship crash-landed, forming the massive crater. Realizing the sincerity in Walker's quest, the aliens allow his mother to return with him, as they have managed to make contact with their home planet. Epilogue: Upon returning to the surface with his mother, Walker reunites with the shocked team members. They collectively decide to maintain the secret of the alien base to protect the extraterrestrial lifeforms from the world's destructive nature. Walker learns that sometimes, the answers to the universe's biggest mysteries lie in the unexplainable intersection of science and the unknown. The movie ends with Walker and his mother witnessing the alien ship leaving the underground base and ascending into the sky, their mission complete, and the crater once again becoming serene and devoid of its previous mysteries. The mother and son embrace, knowing that they have been a part of something truly extraordinary."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Jim is designing a new car and playing around with different materials. If he were to increase the weight of the vehicle, what would happen to the fuel efficiency of that vehicle? It would increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the relationship between vehicle weight and energy From the passage, we know that lighter and more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Step 2: Determine the impact of increasing the weight Since Jim is increasing the weight of the vehicle, it would no longer be lighter and would require more energy. Step 3: Understand the impact on fuel efficiency Fuel efficiency is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. If the vehicle needs more energy due to increased weight, it will consume more fuel, leading to a lower fuel efficiency.

În română: Regulile acquis-ului Schengen trebuie să fie identice pentru toate țările, iar sistemul de evaluare trebuie să se bazeze pe faptul că regulile trebuie îndeplinite în mod constant, nu doar în timpul aderării. Evaluarea aplicării și respectării acestor reguli reprezintă nu numai un proces pentru momentul aderării, ci și o monitorizare continuă a implementării lor în practică. Astfel, sistemul de evaluare al acquis-ului Schengen presupune un cadru comun, care pune accent pe respectarea și aplicarea corectă a normelor și criteriilor stabilite la nivel european. În acest context, transparența, cooperarea și schimbul de bune practici între statele membre sunt esențiale pentru buna funcționare a spațiului Schengen și pentru asigurarea securității, mobilității și liberei circulații a persoanelor în interiorul acestuia. Mecanismul de evaluare a acquis-ului Schengen se bazează, în principal, pe trei instrumente: 1. Evaluările experților: În cadrul acestor evaluări, experți din diferite țări membre analizează și verifică aplicarea acquis-ului Schengen în țara respectivă, oferind recomandări și măsuri necesare pentru îndeplinirea criteriilor. Aceste evaluări sunt efectuate în mod regulat și vizează diferite domenii, cum ar fi controlul la frontiere, vizele, cooperarea polițienească, protecția datelor și aplicarea legislației relevante. 2. Rapoartele de evaluare: Pe baza evaluărilor experților și a altor surse de informații, Comisia Europeană elaborează și publică rapoarte de evaluare privind respectarea și aplicarea acquis-ului Schengen. Aceste rapoarte vizează atât țările care aspirează să adere la spațiul Schengen, cât și țările membre care au aderat deja. 3. Mecanismul de reacție rapidă Schengen (SRR): SRR permite Comisiei Europene și Consiliului să ia măsuri rapide și eficiente în cazul în care o țară membră Schengen întâmpină dificultăți semnificative în aplicarea acquis-ului, punând în pericol securitatea și funcționarea spațiului Schengen. Prin intermediul acestui sistem de evaluare al acquis-ului Schengen, se urmărește menținerea încrederii reciproce între statele membre și garantarea unui spațiu comun de libertate, securitate și justiție.

Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.

Intercept Pharma's Shares Are Spiking After a Key FDA Panel Backing Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ icpt stock rose as much as 11% in after-hours trading on Thursday after an FDA advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of a rare liver disease treatment developed by the company. But shares slumped nearly 7% in early trading Friday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. Although Intercept’s shares have surged more than 30% in the past month in anticipation of the FDA ruling, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded that the liver drug may not fulfill its market potential due to safety concerns in some patients with more advanced versions of the disease. Intercept is working on a treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, a chronic liver ailment that can eventually degrade bile ducts to the point of permanent scarring. The disease disproportionately affects women. Thursday’s advisory panel voted 17-0 in favor of approving the drug despite some previously stated safety concerns. The FDA isn’t required to follow independent panel recommendations, but usually does, making the therapy’s approval all but assured. The agency will decide whether or not to approve the treatment by May 29. While an approval for PBC could bring in millions in sales, some analysts have also predicted that number could balloon into the billions if the Intercept drug can win an FDA approval for the more common nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a condition in which fatty deposits in the liver cause inflammation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The governor of Louisiana and founder of New Orleans, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville determined to stop Chickasaw trade with the British. In 1721 he was able to incite the Choctaw who began to raid Chickasaw villages, and to ambush pack trains along the Trader's Path leading to Charleston, South Carolina. In response, the Chickasaw regrouped their villages more tightly for defense, and cemented relations with their British source of guns by establishing a settlement at Savannah Town, South Carolina, in 1723. They blocked French traffic on the Mississippi River by occupying Chickasaw Bluff near present day Memphis, and bargained for peace with the Choctaw. Bienville himself was recalled to France in 1724 . On and off over the following years, the French successfully reignited the Indian conflict. The Choctaw pursued their familiar hit and run tactics: ambushing hunting parties, killing trader's horses, devastating croplands after using superior numbers to drive the Chickasaw into their forts, and killing peace emissaries. Illini and Iroquois occasionally pitched in from the north as well. This war of attrition effectively wore the Chickasaw down, reaching a crisis level in the late 1730s and especially the early 1740s. After a lapse due to strife within the Choctaw, the bloody harassment resumed in the 1750s. The Chickasaw remained obstinate, their situation forcing them to adhere even more closely to the British. In 1734, Bienville returned to Louisiana, and waged grand campaigns against the Chickasaw in the European style.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were struck by the warm, elegant ambiance and exceptional attention to detail in the décor. The tasteful, intimate lighting and tastefully arranged tables created a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for our special occasion. Our server, Jane, greeted us promptly and cordially, taking the time to explain the evening's specials and answer any questions we had about the menu. Throughout our meal, she was attentive without being overbearing, striking just the right balance to make us feel well taken care of without feeling rushed or interrupted. The food itself was nothing short of phenomenal. We began our meal with the restaurant's signature appetizer, the Mushroom Brie Soufflé, which featured a rich, creamy, and perfectly seasoned filling encased in a delicate, golden-brown pastry crust. I can honestly say that it was one of the best appetizers I've ever tasted. For our entrees, I chose the Herb-Crusted Lamb Chops while my husband opted for the Seared Scallops and Risotto. Both dishes were flawlessly executed, showcasing the skill and creativity of The Culinary Castle's talented chefs. The Herb-Crusted Lamb Chops were tender and succulent, with just the right amount of pinkness in the center, and the accompanying garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were the perfect accompaniment. My husband's Seared Scallops were equally impressive, boasting a beautiful sear and a creamy, savory risotto that left us discussing the dish long after we'd finished it. We ended our meal with the Chocolate Decadence Cake and were once again blown away by the impeccable quality of the dessert. Rich, moist, and not too sweet, it was an ideal way to conclude our memorable dining experience. Overall, our time at The Culinary Castle was nothing short of extraordinary, and I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. From the warm, inviting atmosphere and flawless service to the outstanding, innovative dishes prepared with the finest ingredients, every aspect of our meal was a testament to the restaurant's commitment to delivering a first-class dining experience. I have no doubt that we will be back to celebrate many more special occasions at The Culinary Castle and can confidently encourage others to do the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the role of the specific person was called out in the lawsuit?\\" is in \\"On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"In the lawsuit filed by the NAACP on August 18, 1970, against Michigan state officials, the specific person called out was Governor William Milliken. The lawsuit charged him and other officials with de facto public school segregation. The NAACP alleged that even though there was no legal segregation in place, the city of Detroit and surrounding counties had implemented policies that perpetuated racial segregation in public schools. They further argued that this segregation was closely related to unfair housing practices, which led to segregated neighborhoods and, consequently, segregated educational institutions. The District Court's ruling held all levels of government accountable for the segregation, and the Sixth Circuit Court partially agreed, stating that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. When the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court as Milliken v. Bradley, the Court ruled in a narrow decision that schools were a matter of local control, and suburban districts could not be forced to resolve problems within the city's school district. In summary, the role of the specific person called out in the lawsuit, Governor William Milliken, was that he was one of the Michigan state officials accused of perpetuating de facto public school segregation through policies and practices that disproportionately affected racial minorities in Detroit and its surrounding areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer is:","completion":"Kendall may likely want to find out a way to contact the individual (III) after really liking the person she matched up with during the speed dating event. This course of action offers a more reasonable and respectful way of getting to know someone better, as opposed to stalking them on social media (II), which could come across as invasive and creepy, or attending an event they may not be comfortable with (I). Given that Kendall has already expressed interest in continuing to know her match, she may look for ways to initiate a conversation, send them a message or get in touch through mutual acquaintances if they have any. She could also explore the possibility of connecting with them through the platform where the speed dating event was hosted, as it is common for such events to have a follow-up mechanism for successful matches. Once Kendall manages to make contact, she might want to gradually build a rapport with the person. This could involve exchanging messages, engaging in conversations on various topics, and understanding shared interests or values. As the relationship progresses, they could plan to meet up again in person - this time in a more relaxed setting, like at a coffee shop or a casual restaurant, to reduce the pressure of a formal date. During the initial conversations, Kendall should focus on striking a balance between showing genuine interest in getting to know her match and respecting their privacy. By being genuine and attentive, she can demonstrate that she is interested in learning more about them without infringing on their personal boundaries. In turn, this would allow the person to open up at their own pace, creating a solid foundation for potentially forming a strong, long-lasting connection. At the same time, Kendall should make sure to share information about herself as well and express her feelings honestly, ensuring the conversation goes both ways. Mutual understanding and transparency will help in nurturing trust and forging a healthy relationship with the individual. One important aspect Kendall should bear in mind is to always be patient and let the relationship develop naturally. By approaching her match in a respectful and sincere manner, along with giving each other adequate time to gauge the compatibility, Kendall may find herself entering into a meaningful relationship with the person she liked during the speed dating event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s. - The Illusion of Progress is the sixth studio album by American rock band Staind. It was released on August 19, 2008. \\"The Illusion of Progress\\" was produced by Johnny K and recorded in lead singer Aaron Lewis' home studio. It debuted at No. 3 in the \\"Billboard\\" 200 with 91,800 units sold. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - \`\` King of All Excuses '' is the fourth and final single to be released from American alternative metal band Staind 's fifth studio album Chapter V. - Staind is an American rock band, formed in 1995 in Springfield, Massachusetts. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki (who left in May 2011).

The band has had five chart-topping singles and sold over 15 million records worldwide. - Break the Cycle is the third studio album by American rock band Staind, released through Elektra Entertainment and Flip Records in 2001. It is Staind's most successful album to date, and was the album that broke them into the mainstream. It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent 3 weeks at number one position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of the \\"Billboard\\" 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold at least 4 million copies in 2001.

A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kasich has lived much of his adulthood in Ohio, specifically the state capital of Columbus. Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, where grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \\"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\\" The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015.

Please briefly summarize this news article: How the Economic Recovery Is Leaving Many Behind By Rana Foroohar Monday, Aug. 12, 2013 Job seekers wait in line to meet with a recruiter during the East Bay's HIREvent on July 17, 2013 in Emeryville, Calif. For some time now, the U.S. has been the prettiest house on what is an ugly economic block. Look around: China and many of the other major emerging markets are slowing down, and Europe is in recession. The U.S., on the other hand, finally seems to be moving beyond 2% annual economic growth toward a more robust recovery. The big question is whether it will be a recovery for everyone. The answer so far seems to be a definitive no. The percentage of Americans in the labor force, arguably the most important measure of economic health, dropped to a 34-year low in May. That's as bad as it's been since women entered the labor force en masse in the 1980s, and it speaks to the fact that this recovery is weaker and has taken longer than rebounds of the past. We're 30 months on from when GDP returned to prerecession levels, but even at June's high level of job creation (195,000) it will take 15 months more to replace the jobs that were lost. While the unemployment figure is slowly ticking downward from the crisis' peak of 10%, it remains in double digits for certain groups, such as young people without college degrees and African Americans. Meanwhile, economic inequality has increased, since minorities were disproportionately hit in the housing crisis, and wages have stayed flat. It's hard to envision an inclusive recovery when a majority of Americans simply haven't got more money in their pockets. That puts the American Dream at risk. \\"If young Americans are to live better than their parents did, we have to expand employment, make the workforce more competitive and accelerate productivity growth,\\" which is strongly correlated with rising wages, says Susan Lund, a principal at the McKinsey Global Institute, which just released a report titled \\"Game Changers\\" on how to build a more robust recovery in the U.S. One key challenge will be to create more sustainable demand in an economy that is 70% driven by consumer spending. Yes, Americans have gone a long way toward repairing their balance sheets since 2008. Fewer of us have debt than we did back then. But those who do, including vulnerable groups like students and seniors, have 40% more debt than they did before the financial crisis, according to the Census Bureau. And consumer spending is still spotty. While overall retail sales have grown over the past year, June numbers came in far weaker than expected. Department-store sales were down for the fifth month in a row, and restaurant spending was sharply down as consumers once again ate in to save a dollar. People even bought fewer electronic gadgets for a third month running. The latest GDP figure--1.7%--shows we are still struggling to stay in a 2% economy. \\"To say we're doing better than Europe is meager consolation,\\" says Lund. \\"We need to do much better.\\" Of course, the economy is cyclical, and one bad quarter won't derail a recovery. What you want to see is sustained job growth, and the most recent new-hire numbers were stellar. The question is whether they were a blip or a real directional shift from what we've seen over the past several years. Even before the financial crisis, there were signs that the U.S. jobs engine was sputtering. Job creation from 2000 to 2007 was far weaker than in decades past. This is in part because small and new companies, which do much of the real hiring in the U.S., still have problems getting bank loans. Indeed, Urban Institute senior fellow Gene Steuerle believes that one key reason for the declining number of jobs being created by new businesses is that entrepreneurs have exhausted their personal savings, which most of them use in lieu of loans to fund investment. Banks, which claim they are trying to meet higher capital requirements, won't step in to help. This underscores the fact that five years on from the crisis, finance is still disconnected from the real economy. Sure, banks are recording record profits, but numerous studies show that as finance as a percentage of the economy grows, business creation actually tends to stall. A banking recovery isn't enough to turn the economy around--we need manufacturing and services to grow too. Yes, a manufacturing renaissance is under way. But it isn't your grandfather's manufacturing. Well-paid union jobs have given way to cheaper labor and to robots that do work that people used to do, which is partly why wages have remained flat. That's just another reason that too many Americans won't feel the buoyancy of this divided rebound for many years to come.","completion":"The US economic recovery appears to be leaving many people behind, with the percentage of Americans in the labor force dropping to a 34-year low in May 2013. The recovery looks weaker and longer than previous rebounds, with unemployment still high for some groups and economic inequality on the rise. A key challenge for an inclusive recovery is creating sustainable demand in a consumer-driven economy. Banks are recording record profits, but studies show that when finance is a large part of the economy, business creation can stall. Although a manufacturing renaissance is happening, well-paid union jobs have been replaced by cheaper labor and automation, contributing to stagnant wages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context: In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

A: Answer:","completion":"The areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus of the atom are known as atomic orbitals or electron shells. These shells are regions in an atom where electrons with a specific energy level are likely to be found, and they are organized into energy levels corresponding to increasing distances from the nucleus. The concept of electron shells is derived from the quantum mechanical model of the atom, which takes into account the wave-like nature of electrons and their discrete energy states. The atomic orbitals can be further classified based on their shapes, which are mathematically described by the wave functions of the electrons. There are four main types of orbitals – s, p, d, and f orbitals – each with a different shape and accommodating different numbers of electrons. 1. S Orbitals: These are spherical orbitals and can be found in all energy levels or principal quantum numbers (n). Every s orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. The size of the sphere increases with the increase in the principal quantum number, which means the electron is located farther from the nucleus. 2. P Orbitals: These orbitals have a dumbbell shape and can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 2 or higher. The p orbitals are oriented along three axes – x, y, and z – and each is capable of holding a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a maximum of six electrons can occupy a single p subshell. 3. D Orbitals: The d orbitals are more complex in shape compared to s and p orbitals and can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 3 or higher. There are five d orbitals, and each can hold a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a single d subshell can accommodate up to 10 electrons. 4. F Orbitals: Having the most complex shape, f orbitals can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 4 or higher. There are seven f orbitals, and each can hold a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a single f subshell can accommodate up to 14 electrons. Overall, each electronic shell or energy level can hold a significant number of electrons, with the capacity increasing progressively as the distance from the nucleus increases. For example, the first shell (n=1) has only an s orbital and can hold two electrons, the second shell (n=2) can hold up to eight electrons, the third shell (n=3) can hold up to 18 electrons, and so on. It's important to note that the electrons in an atom fill the orbitals according to specific rules, such as the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. These rules help to determine the electron configuration of an atom, which in turn affects the atom's chemical properties and reactivity. The distribution of electrons across different orbitals forms the basis of modern chemistry and understanding the behavior of various elements and their compounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Chancellor, executed in 1535, became the patron saint of politicians????","completion":"Sir Thomas More, the Chancellor executed in 1535, became the patron saint of politicians. Born in London on February 7, 1478, Thomas More was a renowned lawyer, philosopher, statesman, and writer. His steadfast faith in God and his moral conviction played a significant part in his subsequent veneration as a saint by the Catholic Church. More began his career as a lawyer and eventually became a Member of Parliament. As he progressed further, he attracted the attention of King Henry VIII, who appointed More to various important positions within the government. His most prominent role was the Lord Chancellor of England, a position that he was appointed to in 1529. In this role, More had the highest-ranking office in the land, just below the king. As Chancellor, More remained dedicated to standing up for his beliefs, particularly regarding religious and moral issues. He was a devoted Catholic and believed in the authority of the pope. When King Henry VIII decided to break with the Catholic Church due to their refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, More was put in a difficult position. The king demanded that his subjects accept his new role as the Supreme Head of the Church of England, which subsequently required them to reject the authority of the pope. While many others complied with the king's demands, More refused to renounce his faith and loyalty to the Pope. This defiance led to his arrest, trial, and ultimately, his execution on July 6, 1535. Throughout these events, More maintained his faith and unwavering commitment to his principles. His final words were a testament to his devotion: \\"I die the King's good servant, but God's first.\\" Recognizing the significance of More's unwavering commitment to his faith, the Catholic Church honored him with sainthood. Pope Pius XI canonized Thomas More as a saint on May 19, 1935, and declared him the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. Saint Thomas More is often celebrated for his integrity, wisdom, and moral courage. Today, he stands as an inspiration to many, particularly those in the political sphere, as a reminder that personal convictions should not be compromised, even in the face of great adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

A: The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it; in official use, it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: The Norfuk language is a unique and fascinating creole language primarily spoken on Norfolk Island, which is a small island located in the Pacific Ocean between Australia and New Zealand. The language is a mixture of 18th-century English, specifically the dialect spoken by the English settlers who arrived on Norfolk Island, and Tahitian, which was the native language of many of the Polynesian people who also arrived on the island. The origin of the Norfuk language can be traced back to the Pitcairn Islands, where in the late 18th century, a mixture of English sailors and Tahitian companions settled down. It was during this time that the foundations of the Norfuk language were established as the settlers needed a common language to communicate with each other. Most of these settlers were English-speakers, while the wives and descendants of the sailors were largely Tahitian in origin. This blended community inevitably led to the development of a unique language combining elements of both English and Tahitian. Over time, the population of the Pitcairn Islands grew and eventually relocated to Norfolk Island in the mid-19th century, where the ancestors of today's Norfolk Islanders became a distinct community of people. The Norfuk language continued to evolve as a result of various external factors, such as the influence of new English-speaking settlers arriving on the island and the broadening of trade and cultural exchange activities with neighboring islands. Consequently, the Norfuk language has absorbed various linguistic elements from diverse sources. The vocabulary of the Norfuk language is predominantly derived from the 18th-century English dialect spoken by the early settlers, and the grammar has considerable simplification in comparison with the English language. However, there are significant borrowings from the Tahitian language as well, particularly in terms of vocabulary related to the natural environment, cultural practices, and family relationships. The influence of these two languages on the Norfuk language is not limited to vocabulary and grammar alone. Pronunciation and intonation of Norfuk are also interestingly marked by noticeable elements of both English and Tahitian. Additionally, there are some linguistic features in Norfuk that cannot be directly attributed to either English or Tahitian, as they appear to have arisen through the complex process of interaction between these languages over a long period of time. In recent years, the Norfuk language has gained some official recognition and protection, with the Norfolk Island Language (Norf'k) Act 2004 designating Norfuk as one of the two official languages of Norfolk Island, alongside English. However, as mentioned earlier, the act does not mandate the use of Norfuk but simply recognizes and protects it, and when used in official contexts, an accurate English translation has to be provided as well. In conclusion, the Norfuk language is a fascinating amalgamation of 18th-century English and Tahitian that embodies the unique cultural and linguistic history of the Norfolk Island community. Despite facing numerous challenges such as the decline in the number of fluent speakers, efforts to preserve and promote the Norfuk language continue, reflecting the significance of this linguistic treasure to the heritage and identity of the Norfolk Islanders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Larry Wayne Gatlin (born May 2, 1948) is an American country and Southern gospel singer and songwriter. As part of a trio with his younger brothers Steve and Rudy, he achieved considerable success within the country music genre, performing on thirty-three Top 40 singles (combining his solo recordings and those with his brothers). As their fame grew, the band became known as Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers. Larry Gatlin is known for his rich falsetto singing style and for the unique pop-inflected songs he wrote and recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. With West's help, Gatlin found work in Nashville as a background singer for Kris Kristofferson. In 1973, Gatlin landed a solo recording contract with Monument Records. In 1973, Gatlin released his first album, The Pilgrim. Two singles were released from the album: \\"Sweet Becky Walker\\" and \\"Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall\\", though both failed to chart. The latter was recorded by Elvis Presley in 1976 (who had also recorded Gatlin's \\"Help Me\\" in 1973). In 1974 came the release of a new album, Rain/Rainbow, and a new song \\"Delta Dirt\\". The album and single proved more successful. \\"Delta Dirt\\" was a Top 20 Country hit, peaking at No. 14. The song was also Gatlin's only entry on the Pop charts, when it reached No. 84. In 1975, Gatlin had his first major hit with his composition \\"Broken Lady\\", which reached No. 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 1976. Gatlin won a Grammy Award for the song in 1977 for Best Country Song. A new album, High Time, was released in 1976. Gatlin is also credited on guitar on Willie Nelson's 1976 album The Troublemaker. Brothers Steve and Rudy made their first appearance on Larry's 1976 album Larry Gatlin with Family & Friends. They were featured on some of Gatlin's other hits he had during the late 1970s, notably \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", \\"Love Is Just a Game\\", and \\"Statues Without Hearts\\". In 1978, Gatlin scored his first number one hit with \\"I Just Wish You Were Someone I Love.\\" Gatlin continued his success as a solo artist up until 1978, when he released his last solo album, Oh Brother, which featured the top 10 hits \\"I've Done Enough Dyin' Today\\" and \\"Night Time Magic\\", the latter of which also made an entry into the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Both songs spotlighted Gatlin's soaring falsetto that became a trademark of his vocal style. In 1977, Gatlin joined entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country music stars, such as Conway Twitty, Jerry Reed, Cal Smith, and Richard Sterban, as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a minor league baseball team of the Double-A Southern League that began play in 1978. did any of his songs do well on the charts?","completion":"Yes, many of Larry Gatlin's songs did well on the charts.

(2). yes.","completion":"First, let's address each question individually: 1. How much does it cost to replace rotors? To determine the cost of replacing rotors, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the type of vehicle. Different vehicles have different types of rotors, which can impact the cost of replacement. Step 2: Determine the make, model, and year of the vehicle. This information can help in identifying the correct rotor type and average price range for rotor replacement. Step 3: Research the average cost of rotors for the specified vehicle. This can vary depending on the brand, quality, and location where the rotors are purchased. Additionally, consider whether only the front or rear rotors are being replaced, or both. Step 4: Calculate the labor cost. Labor costs can vary by location and the specific mechanic or automotive shop. The average labor cost for rotor replacement can range from 50 to 150 per rotor, but this may vary. Step 5: Add the cost of the rotors and the labor cost together to arrive at the total cost of replacing rotors. 2. How much does it cost to replace a street light pole? How is this cost calculated? To calculate the cost to replace a street light pole, follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the type of street light pole. The type of pole can impact the cost, as they come in a variety of materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, or concrete) and designs. Step 2: Identify if any additional electrical components need replacement or upgrades. These can include the lamp, wiring, or other electrical components associated with the pole. Step 3: Research the cost of the street light pole. Prices can vary based on the material, height, and design of the pole. Step 4: Estimate the labor costs. This can vary by location, contractor, and level of expertise required for the replacement. Labor costs often include the removal of the old pole and installation of the new one, in addition to any required electrical work. Step 5: Calculate any additional fees or permits. Depending on the location, there may be fees or permits required for the replacement of the street light pole. Step 6: Add the cost of the street light pole, labor, and any additional fees or permits to arrive at the total cost of replacing a street light pole. Now, let's evaluate if both questions have the same meaning: The two questions inquire about the cost of two different things: replacing rotors on a vehicle and replacing a street light pole. However, the underlying principle of the questions, which is to determine the cost of a replacement or repair, is similar. Based on the similarity in the underlying principle, as well as the distinction between the subjects of the questions, the answer would be: (1). No."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve -5*w = -0 - 20 for w.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. and the situation: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees. Answer the following question: Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information, if Illinois adds more fossil fuel burning factories, the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will likely increase. Let's break this down: 1. The process of burning fossil fuels - which is how the factories in Illinois are producing energy - releases carbon dioxide into the air. 2. More factories burning fossil fuels equates to more carbon dioxide being released. 3. The carbon dioxide isn't recycled back into the environment until it's used by humans or absorbed through processes like photosynthesis. 4.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Choose from: I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell. III. no.","completion":"According to the premise, \\"The techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability and quality and for aggregating the information are what constitute the cumulative part of the methodology.\\" This statement indicates that there are existing techniques in place as part of the cumulative methodology that are designed to ensure sufficient comparability and quality, as well as aggregation of information. Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability.\\" This hypothesis posits that there may be an absence or insufficiency of techniques focused on comparability. In order to determine whether the premise entails this hypothesis, we must analyze if accepting the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis. Upon careful analysis, it becomes clear that the premise acknowledges the existence of techniques for sufficient comparability and quality. It states that these techniques form a crucial part of the cumulative methodology, which implies that they are integral to the process being discussed. Therefore, since the premise claims the presence of techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability, it actually contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests a lack of such techniques. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer to the question of whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability\\" is III. no. The premise does not support the hypothesis, and in fact, it provides evidence against it by stating that the techniques for sufficient comparability exist and are significant components of the cumulative methodology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The background to this heart-wrenching story takes us back to the outbreak of the Korean War, which commenced in June 1950 when North Korea, supported by the Soviet Union and China, launched an invasion into South Korea establishing a rigid communist regime. This event set the stage for a brutal and prolonged conflict that lasted for over three years. As the war intensified, Thomas Hudner and Jesse Brown, two brave US Navy pilots, found themselves in the thick of the fight. During one harrowing mission near the Jangjin Reservoir – referred to as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans – Jesse Brown's plane was badly damaged, forcing him to make a devastating crash landing. Witnessing his friend's plight, Hudner heroically took the decision to crash land his own plane in an attempt to save his comrade's life. Despite Hudner's valiant efforts, Brown's injuries ultimately proved fatal, but not before he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his exceptional courage and devotion in the face of harrowing circumstances. Hudner's selflessness and heroism were also duly recognized, as he was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that fateful day. As the years have passed, the sacrifices made by these brave men and countless others during the Korean War have not been forgotten. In a poignant reminder of the bonds forged in battle, Thomas Hudner has expressed his desire to return to the battleground that claimed the life of his friend Jesse Brown. This powerful act of remembrance serves as a lasting tribute to the strength, courage, and resolve displayed by these men, and the countless others who fought alongside them during those dark days of conflict. In facing the painful memories of tragedy and loss, the journey back to the Jangjin Reservoir will serve as a powerful reminder that the enduring bonds of friendship and brotherhood transcend even the most devastating circumstances. It is through this act of remembrance that Hudner, and others like him, can continue to honor the memory of those brave souls who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"who's order was amended in 1967?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\".

In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan).

Monitoring your progress is important when you're losing weight. Stepping on the scale regularly can help you see how effective your diet program is going and whether or not you need to make any changes. Remember, safe weight loss is about one to two pounds per week. Be patient with your progress. You're more likely to sustain slow and steady weight loss in the long-term. For the most accurate pattern of results, it's best to weigh yourself at the same time of day, on the same day of the week and in the same clothes (or choose to go without clothes). If your weight loss has plateaued or you've begun to gain weight, recheck your meal plans and food journals and see if you can cut out any more calories to help weight loss. Having friends, family members or co-workers supporting you through your weight loss plan may help you continue to lose weight and maintain it long-term. Build a support group to help you stay on track. See if others you know also want to lose weight. Many times people find it easier to tackle weight loss together as a group. You can also try finding online support groups or support groups that meet in person on a weekly or monthly basis. Get support by working with a registered dietitian; he/she can customize your meal plan and provide on-going support. Having a motivating and enticing reward at the end of your weight loss goals can help push you through to the end. Set up something exciting for yourself as you meet your goals. Ideas to try include: Buying yourself new shoes or clothes. Treating yourself to a round of golf or other favorite sport. Getting a massage or other spa treatment. Avoid food-related rewards, as these can trigger old habits that might not be conducive to weight loss.","completion":"Regularly monitoring your weight loss progress, building a support group, and setting motivating rewards can help you effectively and sustainably lose weight at a safe pace of one to two pounds per week."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: At the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, Commodore lowered the retail price of the 64 to 300, and stores sold it for as little as 199. At one point the company was selling as many computers as the rest of the industry combined. Its prices for the VIC-20 and 64 were 50 lower than Ataris prices for the 600XL and 800XL. Commodores strategy was to, according to a spokesman, devote 50% of its efforts to the under-500 market, 30% on the 500–1000 market, and 20% on the over-1000 market. Its vertical integration and Tramiels focus on cost control helped Commodore do well during the price war, with 1 billion in 1983 sales. Although the company and Tramiels focus on cost cutting over product testing caused many hardware defects in the 64, by early 1984 Synapse Software—the largest provider of third-party Atari 8-bit software—received 65% of sales from the Commodore market, and Commodore sold almost three times as many computers as Atari that year. How many percent of sales from Synapse Software were not from sales from teh Commodore market?","completion":"Okay, little buddy, let me explain this to you. So, Synapse Software is like a toy store that sells different toys for different types of game machines. They found out that when people bought toys (software) for Commodore machines, it made up 65% of their total sales. Now, we want to find out how much sales came from other machines, not the Commodore ones. To do that, we think like this: the total sales are 100%. If 65% were from Commodore sales, then we can subtract that from the total, like this: 100% - 65% = 35%. So, 35% of Synapse Software's sales were not from the Commodore market."},{"prompt":"Q: What fertilizes an egg during sexual reproduction?

Q:This article: Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known as a founding member of Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by Michael Jackson, including Thriller, the best-selling album of all time. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. In 1976, when Lukather was nineteen years old, he was invited by his high school friends David Paich and the Porcaro brothers Steve and Jeff to join them in forming their band, Toto. He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring. Lukather's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and the Porcaro brothers, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a steady flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s. Lukather has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards, and has won five. While his work with Toto was predominantly based on pop rock music and his solo work ventures into progressive rock and hard rock, many of Lukather's side-projects are focused on jazz fusion. He held a long-time collaboration with jazz guitarist Larry Carlton that produced a Grammy-winning live album, and he was a member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of notable session musicians. Since 2012, Lukather has toured with former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr's live supergroup, the All-Starr Band.

Being clean will help you look and feel your best in front of the camera. Shampoo and condition your hair and create a lather with your soap or body wash. Go over your whole body with the soap from top to bottom. It’s best if you take a shower either the night before or the morning of picture day. It’s best for your skin to keep your shower short (5-10 minutes) and the water lukewarm or cooler. Pat yourself dry with a towel and moisturize your body with body lotion afterward. At the very least, comb out any tangles so it looks neat and nice and give yourself a straight part. If you want, straighten, curl, or scrunch your hair to make it look a little more special. Clean your face every night, and if you have a foolproof method that prevents acne for you, follow it. This will improve your chances of having a clean, clear, beautiful face on picture day. Use a gel-based or foamy cleanser if you have normal to oily skin. Use a creamy moisturizing cleanser if you have dry skin. Make sure to floss and brush your teeth every day in the morning and at night. Doing this will remove bacteria from your teeth which will keep them whiter, help prevent gum disease, and keep your teeth from decaying. Make sure to brush for about 2 minutes every time to make your smile look bright. Before taking your picture, you may have some ketchup on your cheek from lunch or some stray hairs sticking up. Pack a comb and hand-held mirror in your backpack the night before so you can give your appearance one last check and touch up before getting in front of the camera. A fresh trim will look great in your school pictures. For a clean-cut, put-together look, get a haircut just a few days or a week before picture day. Make sure you’re drinking enough water and getting enough sleep in the days leading up to picture day. Keeping yourself hydrated and well-rested will give you an energized smile and healthy-looking skin.

In February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama Bin Laden and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al Zawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed a fatwa issued in the name of a \\"World Islamic Front.\\" A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a respected Islamic authority, but neither Bin Laden, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were scholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV, Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets.\\" Note: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety of names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: Nawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \\"al\\" that would be part of their name in their own societies. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \\"Bin\\" as part of a last name, as in Bin Laden. Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English. We have relied on a mix of common sense, the sound of the name in Arabic, and common usage in source materials, the press, or government documents. When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e.g.,\\"al Qida\\" instead of al Qaeda. Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Laden's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.

Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

Here's the step-by-step plan on how to complete this task: 1. Identify the context: In order to understand the statement, it is important to first identify the context in which it was made. This may require researching which California governor said the quote and the circumstance they said it in. 2. Interpret the statement: After determining the context, try to analyze the meaning of the statement. \\"Inaction may be the highest form of action\\" can be understood as sometimes not taking any action might be the best action or decision in a given situation. Since it is a quote, it might have deeper implications depending on the context, personal beliefs, and the governor's intentions at the time when he made the statement. 3. Answer the question: With the context and interpretation in mind, provide an answer to the question explaining which California governor made the statement and what they might be referring to with the quote. Include any relevant information that might provide additional insight into the quote. In this case, the quote \\"Inaction may be the highest form of action\\" was made by Jerry Brown, the 34th and 39th Governor of California.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Farmer David Cundall explored Burma for nearly two decades to find where the planes were buried in crates. Spitfires believed to be in good condition due to careful containment. Article:","completion":"Title: The Mysterious Buried Spitfires of Burma: Farmer David Cundall's Two Decade Quest Hidden deep beneath the soil of Burma (now known as Myanmar), a cache of priceless wartime artifacts may be waiting for discovery: a squadron of Spitfire aircraft, buried in their original crates and in impeccable condition due to careful containment procedures. One man, farmer David Cundall, was determined to uncover the truth behind this mysterious buried treasure, investing nearly two decades of his life exploring the Southeast Asian country in search of answers. This is the intriguing tale of Cundall's relentless pursuit, and the Spitfires that lay beneath the earth, waiting to be found. For nearly 70 years, the tale of the buried Spitfires in Burma seemed like nothing more than a myth. It was said that at the conclusion of World War II, as the British military prepared to depart the Southeast Asian nation, they were faced with a surplus of unused Spitfire aircraft. As a last-ditch effort to ensure these planes would not fall into the wrong hands, the British forces were believed to have buried them in hastily dug trenches, covering them with large crates which protected these artifacts from the elements. In the years following the war, this story persisted but only as a whispered legend – until David Cundall, a British farmer and amateur aviation historian, came across the tale in the 1990s. Fascinated by the idea of unearthing such a historically significant find, Cundall embarked on a challenging quest to discover the truth. To fund his initial adventures, he sold off personal belongings, reinvesting the proceeds into his mission. Between 1996 and 2012, Cundall conducted a series of reconnaissance trips to Burma, using a combination of old military records, aerial photographs, and testimonies from locals to pinpoint potential burial sites. Over the years, he became increasingly confident that the Spitfires' resting place was located near the modern Yangon International Airport, previously known as RAF Mingaladon - a British airbase during the war. In his quest for the Spitfires, Cundall faced numerous obstacles, including bureaucratic hurdles, complex negotiations with the Myanmar government, and skepticism from fellow aviation enthusiasts and experts. Despite these challenges, he remained dedicated to the cause, driven by the tantalizing prospect of discovering a fleet of nearly pristine Spitfire planes that had been buried for decades. Following nearly two decades of tireless searching, David Cundall enlisted the help of a team of experts, including academics, engineers, and archaeologists. Armed with advanced ground-penetrating radar technology, the team was finally able to announce in 2013 that they had located large unidentified metal objects in the area where the Spitfires were believed to have been buried. Even as controversy and doubt surrounding the existence of the buried planes persisted, a special ceremony was held in Myanmar to celebrate the anticipated recovery of the first buried Spitfire, attended by over two hundred veterans and international journalists. However, disappointment quickly followed, as the initial excavation efforts yielded no results. The team returned in 2014 and continued their search, but to this day, the planes have yet to be uncovered. Farmer David Cundall's unwavering dedication to the search for the buried Spitfires of Burma is a testament to the importance of history and the pursuit of knowledge. Whether his quest eventually uncovers these rumored aircraft or not, Cundall's story serves as an inspiring reminder that sometimes, the journey is just as valuable as the destination, and the truth behind this mysterious legend will continue to captivate imaginations for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The packaging that your eggs come in when you first buy them is also the best place for them to remain while in storage. The composite material of the carton prevents the eggshells from absorbing odors from the other items in the refrigerator. It also serves to keep them safely spaced and covered so that they won’t be cracked or crushed. Built-in refrigerator egg compartments often require you to dump all your eggs in unprotected, which can lead to big messes and wasted eggs. Leaving the eggs in their original carton also ensures that the expiration date remains in plain sight. Eggs are situated in the carton with the bulbous end on top for a reason. This keeps the yolk centered inside, which protects it from breaking. A balanced, intact yolk will taste fresher and yields better results when used in miscellaneous recipes. Avoid moving or repositioning eggs too much, as this may damage the yolk or the natural air pockets inside. Many people think stashing their eggs on the inside of the door is more convenient. However, the main body of the refrigerator is superior for preserving eggs because it allows them to maintain a more consistent temperature. To maximize their lifespan, keep your eggs at around 40 degrees F (7 degrees C) or cooler. Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator makes for more rapid changes in temperature around the door. Processed eggs should always be refrigerated, while it may be okay to store raw, freshly laid eggs at room temperature.","completion":"The original packaging of eggs is the optimal storage location due to its composite material that prevents odor absorption, safe spacing to avoid cracking or crushing, and the visibility of expiration dates, while the arrangement of eggs in the carton, with the bulbous end on top, preserves the yolk and taste.

Here is a detailed comparison between the two: 高铁 (gaotie) - Gaotie literally translates to \\"high-speed rail\\" in English. - Gaotie operates at speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) or more. - These trains generally have a \\"G\\" or \\"C\\" prefix in their train numbers, where \\"G\\" stands for \\"High-Speed\\" and \\"C\\" stands for \\"Intercity High-Speed.\\" - Gaotie trains have better facilities, comfort, and technology compared to other trains in China. - The fare for Gaotie trains is higher than that of 动车 (dong che). - Gaotie lines have been designed exclusively for high-speed trains, resulting in reduced travel times and enhanced passenger experience. 动车 (dong che) - Dong che, short for 动力集中型列车 (dònglì jízhōngxíng lièchē), can be translated as \\"electric multiple unit\\" (EMU) trains. - The operating speeds of dong che trains range from 120 to 250 km/h (75 to 155 mph). - These trains have \\"D\\" or \\"G\\" prefixes in their train numbers, depending on the service pattern and the speed. - Dong che trains are faster than conventional trains and offer more comfort and facilities than regular trains but may not be as advanced or comfortable as gaotie. - The tickets for dong che trains are more economical compared to gaotie, making them more affordable for a larger audience. - 动车 (dong che) trains may share tracks with regular passenger trains, thus potentially having longer travel times compared to gaotie. 2. How many kids read newspapers in India? It is difficult to provide an exact number of children in India who read newspapers. However, it can be inferred that the number is declining due to a shift from print to digital media. With the rise of internet penetration and smartphone usage in India, young people are more inclined to access information and news through online platforms, social media, and apps. Print media is still prevalent in India, and many school children are encouraged to read newspapers for educational purposes. However, the overall number is dwindling as digital media becomes increasingly popular among the youth. It is also worth mentioning that the literacy rate in India plays a role in determining the number of children who read newspapers. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? The questions you have asked do not share the same meaning. The first question pertains to the differences between two types of high-speed trains in China, while the second question inquires about the number of children in India who read newspapers. These questions are entirely different in nature and focus on separate subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To stay awake without drugs.","completion":"Staying awake without drugs can be challenging, especially if you're fighting off sleepiness, boredom, or fatigue. However, it's entirely possible to keep yourself alert and awake through natural and healthy methods. Here are several strategies you can adopt to stay awake without relying on drugs or stimulants: 1. Get sufficient sleep: Ensure that you're getting enough rest every night. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep to help prevent daytime drowsiness and improve mental clarity. 2. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to maintain a consistent sleep and wake pattern, even during weekends, to help regulate your body's internal clock. 3. Avoid heavy meals: Eating large meals can make you drowsy. Instead, consume smaller meals or snacks throughout the day to maintain your energy levels. 4. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to improve your energy levels and help you stay awake. 5. Take brief naps: If you're feeling sleepy during the day, take short power naps (20-30 minutes) to recharge your energy. Avoid napping too close to bedtime, as it may affect your nighttime sleep quality. 6. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help you stay alert and focused. Consider exercising in the morning or during your lunch break for an energy boost. Plus, as little as a 10-minute walk can help revive you when you're feeling drowsy. 7. Adjust your environment: Make sure your surroundings promote alertness. Keep the room well-lit, use a comfortable chair, and maintain a comfortable temperature. Cool temperatures can help keep you awake and focused. 8. Stimulate your senses: Utilize the power of your senses to stay awake. Listen to upbeat, energizing music, try aromatherapy with invigorating scents like peppermint or citrus, and use bright, vibrant colors in your work area to keep you alert. 9. Practice good posture: Sitting up straight with your shoulders back and head elevated can help improve circulation and keep you more alert. 10. Take regular breaks: Make it a habit to stand up, stretch, or walk around every hour to decrease your chances of sitting-related fatigue. 11. Utilize mental stimulation: Keep your mind engaged and alert by tackling challenging tasks, puzzles, or games. Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to stay focused and maintain your motivation. 12. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and practice stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to boost your energy levels and overall well-being. 13. Consume natural stimulants in moderation: Although the goal is to stay away from drugs, you can still opt for natural stimulants like caffeine, found in coffee or tea, without going overboard. Limit your consumption and avoid drinking caffeine late in the day to minimize sleep disturbances. By incorporating these tips and habits into your daily routine, you'll be well on your way to staying awake and alert without relying on drugs or stimulants. Just remember to pay attention to your body, and if extreme fatigue or sleepiness persists, consult a medical professional for further evaluation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not including Neidpath, who owned the other castle that Sir Simon Fraser had for most of its existence? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we first need to gather information about Sir Simon Fraser and the castles he owned. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the answer: Step 1: Identify the castles owned by Sir Simon Fraser. Research and data compilation from historical sources will reveal the castles owned by Sir Simon Fraser. It is already mentioned that Neidpath should not be considered, so we shall only focus on the remaining castles associated with him. Step 2: Determine the timeframe of Sir Simon Fraser's ownership. By investigating historical records and timelines, we can establish the period in which Sir Simon Fraser owned and controlled these castles. This would help in identifying the \\"most of its existence\\" criterion mentioned in the question. Step 3: Examine the ownership history of the other castle(s). Once we establish the castle(s) owned by Sir Simon Fraser for most of its existence, we can look at its ownership history and analyze the data to find out who owned the castle before and after Sir Simon Fraser's ownership period. Step 4: Identify the owner of the other castle. After analyzing the castle's ownership history and its connection to Sir Simon Fraser, we can deduce who specifically owned the castle for the time period excluding Sir Simon Fraser's ownership. After thoroughly researching and analyzing historical records, we find out that: 1. Sir Simon Fraser owned Oliver Castle for most of its existence. 2. Hugh de Balliol was the owner of Oliver Castle before Sir Simon Fraser. In conclusion, the answer is Hugh de Balliol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks.

While someone else could have picked up her daughter, \\"pick-up day gives me a glimpse into that special world where she's just like everyone else, she's a little bit of a different person for the rest of the day,\\" wrote Frank. \\"By the next day, it's back to the harsh realities of managing a difficult, deadly, incurable disease that kills 1 in 20 before the age of 18.\\" Initially coming from New York, Frank had been rerouted to Washington, and had waited for hours at Reagan National Airport before being led down the gateway, then told there were no seats available, and then waived back into the plane. Rushing to make it home before Friday, Frank was worried she wouldn't make it home in time to pick up her 12-year-old daughter. Frank told CNN that while she's not a \\"big Facebook person,\\" she thought it was important to share her incredible experience. She's read up on Anderson since that night, and says he seems like the \\"Sam Walton\\" of the airlines. Wanting to share her story with Delta, Frank reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. Since June 17, it's gotten 194 \\"likes\\" and dozens of comments, including a personal thanks from a Delta employee named Cecelia. Saying she couldn't remember the last time she flew an airline other than Delta, Frank says the comments she's received are 99% positive, and has been overwhelmed with the responses. While Frank doesn't expect to hear from Anderson, she hopes her open letter ended up on his desk, and that he knows how much she appreciated his gesture.

Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil? Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the answer to this question is Bill. This is because Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden, and the mycorrhiza association helps to increase the surface area of the plant's root system, which in turn improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Greeks: Of the new eastern religions introduced into the Greek world, the most successful was Christianity. From the early centuries of the Common Era, the Greeks identified as Romaioi (\\"Romans\\"), by that time the name ‘Hellenes’ denoted pagans. While ethnic distinctions still existed in the Roman Empire, they became secondary to religious considerations and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity. Concurrently the secular, urban civilization of late antiquity survived in the Eastern Mediterranean along with Greco-Roman educational system, although it was from Christianity that the culture's essential values were drawn. What did the label of Hellenes come to stand for during the Common Era of Greece ?","completion":"During the Common Era of Greece, the label of 'Hellenes' came to stand for pagans. This shift in meaning occurred as the Greek people started identifying themselves as Romaioi (\\"Romans\\") following the introduction of new eastern religions into the Greek world, with Christianity being the most successful among them. Under the Roman Empire, ethnic distinctions still existed but they became secondary to religious considerations. The empire saw the importance of using Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and foster a strong Roman national identity. As a result, the term 'Hellenes,' which was once associated with ancient Greek culture and ethnicity, gradually took on a different connotation. It began to denote those who adhered to the older pagan traditions and beliefs, distinguishing them from the Christians who embraced the new faith. Despite this transformation in the meaning of 'Hellenes,' the secular, urban civilization of late antiquity persevered in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Greco-Roman educational system remained intact, and the essence of Greek culture and its values continued to have a significant impact. However, it was through Christianity that the fundamental values of this new society were predominantly derived, leading to a fusion of Greek and Roman elements in a Christian context. Ultimately, the label of 'Hellenes' came to represent those who clung to pagan beliefs and practices, illustrating the shift in religious and cultural dynamics during the Common Era of Greece."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. An American version was on NBC, initially as a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, then as a series from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. The pilot featured Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan, guests Mike Nichols and Elaine May, and supporting performers including Gene Hackman. The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, Buck Henry and Alan Alda, with Nancy Ames singing the opening song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets; regular contributors included Gloria Steinem, William F. Brown, Tom Lehrer and Calvin Trillin. The announcer was Jerry Damon. Also a guest was Woody Allen, performing stand-up comedy; the guest star on the final broadcast was Steve Allen. A running gag was a mock feud with Jack Paar, whose own programme followed TW3 on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to TW3 as \\"Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour.\\" The American version is largely a lost program, although the pilot survives and was donated to the Library of Congress by a collector. Amateur audio recordings of most episodes also survive. After the series' cancellation, Lehrer recorded a collection of his songs used on the show, That Was The Year That Was, released by Reprise Records in September 1965. In the American version, an episode showed a smiling U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson contemplating an easy 1964 campaign against the Republican nominee, U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. The satirists sang that Goldwater could not win because he \\"does not know the dance of the liberal Republicans\\", then a substantial component of the GOP, many of whose members had supported Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the Republican nomination. On April 21, 1985 in the United States, the ABC network aired That Was The Week That Was as a special, hosted by David Frost (also serving as an executive producer) and Anne Bancroft, and featuring future Saturday Night Live cast members Jan Hooks and A. Whitney Brown and puppetry from Spitting Image. Kristy Glass and Kevin Ruf starred in a remake of TW3 for ABC's Primetime Live in the fall of 2004.

She starts to but then receives a call from George, who is on a flight home from a business trip. During a talk with her mother that evening, she asks her if they could try to make their Christmas \\"Dickens-Style\\"; however her mother is reluctant to do this. Another neighbor's daughter, Amber Mottola, is a supermodel, and her mother harps on how Melody's sister is married, and so Melody storms out, saying that she's sorry she's not anything that makes her mother proud, missing her mother saying that she is proud. The next day at work, Melody is passed over for a promotion to the head of the perfume department at the department store where she works for a younger, less skilled co-worker, April May, whose main objective is to sell, not to serve. Melody finally decides to finish her Christmas list, and the next day, she takes it to work and (after some playfulness with Naomi) Naomi puts it in Santa's Mailbox at the department store. Then, things begin to change. She meets Danny Skylar, a boy who wants to buy a perfume that was similar to the smell of his late mother's, and when he can't pay the full amount, Melody loans him the rest, and he puts her name, along with his, on the entry form in a sweepstakes at the store to win a new Ford Mustang convertible. contains an answer for the question: Who plays the part of the woman who asks for a \\"Dickens-Style\\" Christmas?, what is it ?

When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. Now, I have a new situation: Keith has four plants in his backyard, plant A, plant B, plant C, and plant D. Plant A is very large, but plant B is smaller. Plant C and D are the same size. He applied some gibberellins to plant C, but didn't apply anything to plant D. He got curious about why some plants are bigger, while others are not. Answer this question please: Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided about gibberellins and the situation Keith is in with his four plants, plant D would not see an increase in growth after the application of gibberellins. Firstly, let's review the roles of gibberellins in plant growth. Gibberellins are plant hormones that are known to have a direct effect on the growth and development of plants. They play a crucial role in promoting stem elongation and can also help bring an end to dormancy in seeds and buds, allowing them to germinate and grow. In Keith's situation, he has four plants, with plant A being the largest, plant B being smaller, and plants C and D having the same size. He decided to apply gibberellins to plant C and did not apply anything to plant D. As explained earlier, gibberellins have a direct impact on the growth of plants, specifically in promoting stem elongation. Therefore, we can infer that plant C, which was treated with gibberellins, will likely see an increase in its growth due to the presence of these growth-promoting hormones. On the other hand, plant D, which did not receive any gibberellins treatment, is less likely to experience the same growth increase as plant C. Although plants naturally produce gibberellins, the absence of additional gibberellins means that plant D will be relying solely on its endogenous levels of these hormones for growth. As a result, plant D would not see the same increase in growth as plant C, which received the external application of gibberellins. In conclusion, it is plant D that would not see an increase in growth when compared to plant C, since it did not receive any gibberellins treatment. Keith's curiosity about the differences in plant size could be addressed by considering factors such as genetics, environmental factors, and the presence of growth-promoting hormones like gibberellins. By understanding how these factors interact and contribute to plant growth, Keith could potentially adjust conditions and treatments to optimize the growth of his plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One way to find out is by using the ultimatum game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real?

Q: Short running head: Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 using double-quencher probe ORCID : 0000-0002-8002-834X (Yosuke Hirotsu) Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the human life. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory. This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID. Double-quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and improved detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his \\"normal\\" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew. Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?) Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1. Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones \\"mirror\\" the old ones. How profound. Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave. The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone.","completion":"The sentiment of this review appears to be predominantly negative and confused.

Paragraph: In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.

Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time. Some people may become depressed or bored living under those conditions. By studying people living in similar conditions here on Eares NASA hopes to learn how to choose the most suitable people for a space mission, and how to help them get along. They will live in a two-story building. The ground floor is about 86 square meters, roughly the size of a small two-bedroom apartment. It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars. To make it more like being on Mars in the future, they are only able to communicate by email during the experiment. Meanwhile, there will be a 20-minute delay between the time when a message is sent and that when it is received. When they go outside, they will have to suit up in full spacesuits, just as if they were on Mars. The commander is Martha Lenio, a 34-year-old Canadian.

Later in the same quarter, the Vikings increased their lead with an 8-yard TD pass from Favre to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. Closing out the first half was a 3-yard TD pass from Favre to wide receiver Bernard Berrian to make a 21-0 Vikings halftime lead, the first time of the season the Vikings kept their opponent scoreless in the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued to dominate as Favre found wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 7-yard TD pass. Seattle scored their first points of the game when kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 40-yard field goal. Finally, the Vikings put the game away as second-string QB Tarvaris Jackson found Rice again on a 34-yard TD pass. The Seahawks tried to rally with a 1-yard TD run by running back Justin Forsett (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Vikings prevented the Seahawks comeback from advancing any further. With the win, the Vikings improved to 9-1. Brett Favre threw 4 TD passes for the 22nd time in his career (second of the season), breaking the mark set by Dan Marino. Who scored the only points for the Seahawks?","completion":"Kicker Olindo Mare scored the only points for the Seahawks by successfully nailing a 40-yard field goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Which lever would have less friction, lever A or lever B? A:","completion":"Lever A, the hypothetical lever designed by John with ideal mechanical advantage, would have less friction as compared to Lever B, the real-world lever. In the ideal scenario of Lever A, it is assumed that there is no friction to overcome, which results in a higher mechanical advantage. In contrast, Lever B, being a real-world lever, must overcome some friction during its operation, and hence, it will have a lower mechanical advantage compared to Lever A. So, Lever A would have less friction than Lever B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Possible answers: Options are: [A]. None of the above choices . [B]. I usually end up crying after our conversation . [C]. I usually end up annoyed after our conversation . [D]. I usually end up hungry after our conversation . The answer:","completion":"[C]. I usually end up annoyed after our conversation. It seems like the main reason you don't call her more often is that your conversations tend to be negative experiences for you, making you feel annoyed afterwards. Since you know she is likely to complain about things when you call, this can deter you from reaching out to her more frequently. It is natural to want to avoid situations that bring about negative emotions, which is why you typically only call her once every couple of months. However, it is important to recognize that maintaining relationships and open communication can be crucial in keeping connections strong, especially if that person is important to you. To improve your communication with her, consider setting boundaries and finding ways to steer the conversation towards more positive subjects, which may lead to a more enjoyable experience and encourage you to call her more often."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. After the end of the story, the narrator is probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Worried - Healing - not enough information - Angry A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the story, the narrator appears to be in the process of healing from the stroke. The reason behind this conclusion is that the narrator described the events that occurred during and immediately after the stroke, but there are no clear indications of anger or a sense of worry. While it is possible they may feel some mixed emotions from the experience, the narration is predominantly focused on the incident itself rather the emotional state. Since the story does not continue further about the narrator's recovery, it can be assumed that they are in the process of healing as they are reflecting on what happened but not explicitly expressing anger or worry.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Chokwe Selassie, aged 13, is working hard to help drivers avoid potholes . The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his creation on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city. Chokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them. The app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the 10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype. While developing the app, the boys took part in a Minority Male Makers Program sponsored by Verizon and held at Jackson State University. They learned 3D printing and design, and how to create apps. Through the program Chokwe and his friends received encouragement and guidance. Although the app isn't yet available for sale, Chokwe is already looking for ways to improve the app. He hopes to add more to it until it spreads all over the country. Question: Which can be Chokwe's future target? Options: A: Encouraging more kids to create apps. B: Taking part in more learning programs. C: Making the app available for sale online. D: Making the app include streets nationwide. Answer:","completion":"D: Making the app include streets nationwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve Answer:","completion":"The final step of the given process, which essentially describes the formation of sedimentary rocks, is the lithification of the sediment. After the wind or water breaks small pieces off a rock, deposits tiny rocks, and they become known as sediment, the layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. This pressure compacts the layers and forces out water, reducing the volume of the sediments. Meanwhile, minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve in the water that is being pushed out. This dissolved mineral solution acts as a natural cement that binds the sediment particles together. The final stage, lithification, is when this process of compaction and cementation leads to the formation of a solid rock. During lithification, the sediment layers undergo a transformation as the compaction forces the grains closer together, eliminating any remaining water between the grains. The dissolved minerals from the rock sediments then crystallize around the particles and on the surfaces of the contacts between those particles. This means that the sediment layers now become interconnected, and solidify to form a coherent rock mass. This new rock formed from the compacted and cemented layers of sediment is known as sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are diverse and can be made up of different minerals or organic materials, such as sandstone, limestone, or coal. Each type of sedimentary rock is formed under specific conditions, and their composition and appearance can provide valuable information about the geological history and environmental conditions of the area in which they were formed. Over time, these sedimentary rocks may also become a part of the rock cycle, where they will eventually be transformed into metamorphic or igneous rocks, or be weathered and eroded to form new sediments, repeating the process all over again."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Mountain Jews speak Judeo-Tat, also called Juhuri, a form of Persian, it belongs to the southwestern group of the Iranian division of the Indo-European languages. Judeo-Tat has Semitic (Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic) elements on all linguistic levels. Among other Semitic elements, Judeo-Tat has the Hebrew sound \\"ayin\\" (\`), whereas no neighboring languages have it. Until the early Soviet period, the language was written with semi-cursive Hebrew alphabet. Later, Judeo-Tat books, newspapers, textbooks, and other materials were printed with a Latin alphabet and finally in Cyrillic, which is still most common today. The first Judeo-Tat-language newspaper, Zakhmetkesh (Working People), was published in 1928 and operated until the second half of the twentieth century. Originally, only boys were educated through synagogue schools. Starting from the 1860s, many well-off families switched to home-schooling, hiring private tutors, who taught their sons not only Hebrew, but also Russian and Yiddish. In the early 20th century, with advance of sovietization, Judeo-Tat became the language of instruction at newly founded elementary schools attended by both Mountain Jewish boys and girls. This policy continued until the beginning of World War II, when schools switched to Russian as the central government emphasized acquisition of Russian as the official language of the Soviet Union. The Mountain Jewish community has had notable figures in public health, education, culture, and art. In the 21st century, the government is encouraging the cultural life of minorities.

Read this article and answer this question In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.

Question: Question: \\"Why would an owl have a better depth of field than another type of bird?\\" Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"An owl has a better depth of field than other types of birds due to a combination of factors including its unique eye and head structure, as well as its specific hunting and foraging needs. In general, birds have different vision characteristics depending on their ecological requirements and behaviors. Owls, being nocturnal predators, possess adaptations that enable them to have a greater depth of field in comparison to other birds, which significantly benefits their hunting abilities. Firstly, the position of the owl's eyes plays a crucial role in enhancing its depth of field. Unlike many birds that have eyes on the sides of their heads providing a wider visual field, owls have eyes positioned at the front of their heads. This frontal eye placement results in binocular vision, which refers to the overlapping of visual fields from both eyes. This overlap enables owls to perceive depth more effectively and estimate the distance to objects, such as their prey, with a higher degree of accuracy. Secondly, the anatomy of an owl's eyes contributes to its superior depth of field. Owls' eyes are large and tubular, with a high density of cells called photoreceptors in their retinas. These photoreceptors are particularly sensitive to low-light conditions, allowing owls to see clearly even in near-darkness. This acute night vision is crucial for owls as they primarily hunt during the night when the ability to perceive depth and distance plays a vital role in successfully capturing prey. In addition to their unique eye structure, owls have an enhanced focusing ability due to their flexible corneas and lenses, which further contributes to their improved depth of field. This flexibility allows owls to rapidly focus on objects at varying distances, from close-up objects to those further away in their surroundings. This quick focusing ability is essential for owls as they have limited eye movement and rely on their heads to direct their gaze. Another factor that contributes to owls' better depth of field is their specialized hunting behavior. Owls are highly adapted to a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, where they perch silently, scanning their surroundings for prey. In this context, the ability to accurately judge distances and depth is crucial for efficient hunting and capturing moving prey in low-light environments. Furthermore, owls' neck structure enables them to rotate their head up to 270 degrees, giving them an extensive field of view without moving their bodies. This increased range of motion allows owls to maintain their exceptional depth perception across a wide area, further improving their hunting capabilities. In conclusion, owls have a better depth of field than other types of birds due to their frontal eye positioning, unique eye anatomy, enhanced focusing ability, specialized hunting behaviors, and neck flexibility. These adaptations work together to provide owls with the necessary depth perception to excel in their nocturnal predatory roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Office Chair Designed to Restore Your Focus at Work Workers are having trouble staying on task. Crammed together with colleagues in open floor plans, lured into procrastination by social media, and inundated by emails, the modern corporate workday for many is an eight-hour parade of distractions, punctuated by lunch. The length of time office workers focus on a computer screen before shifting their attention dropped to 1 minute, 15 seconds in 2012—down from 2 minutes, 18 seconds in 2008, according to research from Gloria Mark, a professor in the department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. Another study published by Mark this year tracked workers for five days, discovering that, on average, they visited Facebook 21 times a day and checked email 74 times. That has left some companies struggling to keep workers’ eyes on their work. But one firm’s misfortune is another’s business opportunity. Enter Steelcase Inc., which claims its new line of office furniture can eliminate distractions and keep workers focused. Called Brody – a play on the words “body” and “brain” – the pod-like workstation is shielded from view by screens on about three sides, depending on the model. With its visible power outlet and dedicated space for a person’s bag, the design is intended to calm anxiety in workers, according to Mark McKenna, a Steelcase designer who worked on the project. Everything from a low charge on a laptop to a handbag that’s not within arms’ reach can spark “latent anxiety” in employees, he said, making them uncomfortable and unable to keep their minds on their to-do list. “When we can just get rid of all of that worry, what you’re left with is you and your work,” he said. Steelcase conducted research in a library, observing how individuals settled down with their work. Many withdrew – finding a quiet place, putting their backs to a wall or just slouching down. The researchers noted that people switched postures frequently. Some people prefer to recline when they focus, but they can end up looking at their screens from a strange angle, straining their neck and shoulders. So Steelcase designed the workstation with a wide, soft seat to support a new posture they call the “alert recline,” which keeps workers upper bodies’ slightly more vertical. The result, McKenna says, is an “escape,” crafted from wood, aluminum and plastic and then covered in an array of fabrics. The units, which start at 2700, are 42 inches wide and about 60 inches long, but they can be attached to each other and configured in a variety of shapes. McKenna hopes the work stations will help users reach “flow,” a state in which individuals become completely absorbed in an activity that uses their skills and challenges them. But Mark is skeptical that a piece of furniture can accomplish that goal. Office workers are plagued more by digital distractions than physical ones, she said. So while the Steelcase furniture might shut out colleagues, unless it can also shut off workers’ phones or Twitter feeds, interruptions will persist. What’s more, she said, isolating workers can result in more random interruptions. When workers are in close quarters with one another, they can see when coworkers are on a call or hammering out a project on deadline, and may be less likely to interrupt those busy workers, Mark’s work has found. When employees are out of sight, colleagues may assume they’re free to answer email. The employee, even cocooned in a Brody, might find responding irresistible. Still, McKenna says his team was able to create “a kind of micro-environment that helps people get into flow,” he said. “We wanted a product that allowed people to escape and focus.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. Modern work environment problems: Workers are struggling to stay focused due to open floor plans, social media, and constant email checking.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What could you make with your voice? Options: - silence - choir - song - radio - telephone Explain why a human would choose \\"song\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"song\\" as the answer to the question because out of the given options, it represents the most creative and expressive use of the human voice. A song is a musical composition typically featuring lyrics and melodies that is performed using the voice, often accompanied by musical instruments. Creating and performing songs allows humans to express themselves artistically, emotionally, and culturally in ways that the other options may not fully capture. Here's a closer look at each option and why \\"song\\" stands out as the ideal choice: 1. Silence: This option would involve not using the voice at all. While silence can have its own merits in certain situations, such as promoting relaxation or focusing the mind, it does not showcase the capabilities of the human voice and is not inherently creative. 2. Choir: A choir is a group of singers who perform together, usually in a choral or classical setting. While singing in a choir can be a fulfilling and enjoyable activity, this option is more limited than \\"song\\" as it focuses on a specific type of vocal performance and typically does not involve creating original compositions. 3. Song: As previously mentioned, this option involves creating and performing music using the human voice, often in combination with other instruments. Songs can range from simple, heartfelt tunes to elaborate, orchestral compositions. They often tell stories, convey emotions, or express cultural ideas, making them a versatile and powerful form of self-expression. Songs can be enjoyed by both the creator and the listener, making them an important aspect of human connection and communication. 4. Radio: Radio refers to the medium of broadcasting audio content via electromagnetic waves. While radio hosts and personalities use their voices as they broadcast, the focus is on delivering news, opinions, or relevant information rather than creative self-expression. Additionally, the human voice is only one small aspect of radio, as it often includes pre-recorded content, such as commercials and music. 5. Telephone: The telephone is a communication tool that enables two individuals to have a conversation using their voices from different locations. While the human voice is certainly an essential aspect of telephone communication, it primarily facilitates everyday conversations rather than promoting artistic or emotional expression. Ultimately, a human would choose \\"song\\" as the answer to the question because it encapsulates the unique ability of the human voice to create and convey art, emotion, and cultural meaning. Singing is an inherently human form of expression that has endured throughout history, resonating with people across continents and generations. This makes \\"song\\" the most fitting choice for showcasing the remarkable capabilities of the human voice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Gavin Joseph, a teenager with Asperger's Syndrome, was beaten up by a group of people for just being different. Asperger's Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to socialize. But instead of putting them into prison for what they did to him, Gavin offered them a chance to become more tolerant and understanding. On Thursday night, some kids were talking about how \\"it's weird \\" that he is always by himself, attending events alone and watching people, and it was \\"creepy\\" that he wanted to be friends with people he didn't know. On Friday night, another kid that overheard that conversation decided to take matters into his own hands and become judge and jury, and this is the result of that. He didn't ask questions, didn't get to know Gavin, never met him, and didn't give him a chance to leave. Gavin was called to meet someone, surrounded by people he didn't know, choked, punched , and left lying on the pavement so he would \\"learn his lesson\\". Gavin emerged from the attack with a concussion , a fractured nose, a bruised esophagus and some damage to his eyes, but thankfully, none of the injuries resulted in permanent damage. But here's the truly amazing part -- Gavin refused to press charges against the people who did this to him. Instead of wanting to see them punished, he wants to see them educated. Gavin asked that his attackers do community service that is disability-related. According to his mother, Gavin also asked that they watch a 20-minute video statement he taped while their families were present so they could see the damage they did and hear the event from his perspective. \\"If you are reading this, I hope you talk to your teens,\\" his mother wrote. \\"Tell them about disabilities you can't see, teach them to be tolerant of people that are different, teach them that if they continuously see someone alone that maybe it is not their choice to be alone, remind them to ask questions first and get to know one another.\\" Question: Why was Gavin beaten by a group of people?

Answer based on context: Coming off their close win over the Panthers the Saints flew to University of Phoenix Stadium for an NFC duel with the Cardinals. In the first quarter the Saints took the early lead as kicker John Carney nailed a 31-yard field goal, followed by QB Drew Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Cardinals replied with kicker Jay Feely making a 37-yard field goal, followed by OT Levi Brown recovering a fumble and returning it 2 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter the Saints fell behind when Feely got a 44-yard field goal, followed the 4th quarter by Feely's 29-yard field goal. Then FS Kerry Rhodes recovered a fumble and ran 27 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. Then the Saints replied with Brees making a 35-yard TD pass to WR Robert Meachem, but had more problems when Brees' pass was intercepted by CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and returned 28 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. How many yards longer was Jay Feely's longest field goal than John Carney's longest?","completion":"To determine the difference in yards between Jay Feely's longest field goal and John Carney's longest, we need to first identify their longest field goals in the given context. John Carney's longest field goal in this context is 31 yards. Jay Feely's longest field goal in the context is 44 yards. To find the difference, subtract John Carney's field goal length from Jay Feely's field goal length: 44 yards (Feely's longest) - 31 yards (Carney's longest) = 13 yards Jay Feely's longest field goal was 13 yards longer than John Carney's longest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Find out the requirements for the shoot, so you know if the photograph needs to be a certain shape or size, or if the band or public relations team has any special requests. Photo passes for concerts often have limits. Many do not allow you to have flash and only allow photos for the first 3 songs. Find out any rules and restrictions ahead of time so you can be prepared and get the best possible shots. Knowing what to expect before the concert can help you determine the best location to take your photographs. Learn the band's music as well as what actions they take on stage. Some bands are very active during a performance and dance around or get into the crowd. Others may have a more mellow style and simply sit or stand while singing. Many concerts take place late at night, so you may be working until the wee hours of the morning. If you are touring with a band, you’ll have to follow the call times and curfews as well. Be prepared to work long hours at a show in addition to spending time editing your photographs. When taking photos for press kits or publications, you’ll be able to choose the location. You must know the band and their music well in order to find a place that is suitable. For example, urban locations might be great for a punk band, while rural locations could be better suited for a country artist. You don’t just want generic shots of band members or performances. It’s essential that you capture the mood of the music and the personality of the band. Wait for that moment when a band member’s personality shines through in their performance to take your shot.

Therefore, my translation in French would be: \\"Pour ceux d'entre vous qui sont réticents à commander en ligne, il est désormais disponible en tant que magasin concept Furniturebox.\\" Let's break this down a little to justify the translation: 1. \\"For those of you who are reluctant\\" translates to \\"Pour ceux d'entre vous qui sont réticents\\". French treats plural forms and pronouns differently so \\"you\\" becomes \\"d'entre vous\\" instead of simple \\"vous\\". 2. \\"about ordering online\\" translates to \\"à commander en ligne\\". In French, the preposition \\"about\\" is translated to 'à' when referencing a particular subject or topic. 3. \\"is now available\\" translates to \\"est désormais disponible\\". The phrase \\"is now available\\" changes to \\"est désormais disponible\\", shifting the 'now' to be more formal ('désormais') than the literal translation of 'now' ('maintenant') in French to sound more natural. 4. \\"as Furniturebox concept store\\" it's translated to the natural phrase \\"en tant que magasin concept Furniturebox\\". The preposition 'as' translate to 'en tant que' in this context in French.

The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off. Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite.

Question: Background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Paragraph: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's? Answer:","completion":"Brandon's soil has less toxic compounds than Jeff's soil. This is because Jeff's soil is hypoxic, which leads to the formation of toxic compounds as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. Since Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, it is less likely to have these toxic compounds formed under low oxygen conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Context: A photo of a dazed Tittle in the end zone taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is regarded among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season. Post-Gazette editors declined to publish the photo, looking for \\"action shots\\" instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took on a life of its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos to hang in the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After at first having failed to see the appeal of the image, Tittle eventually grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. \\"That was the end of the road,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. \\"It was the end of my dream. It was over.\\" Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989. Question: Was there any other memorable moments from this particular game Answer:","completion":"In this football game, a very special moment happened that many people remember. Y.A. Tittle, a famous quarterback, got hit really hard by another player named John Baker. A photographer named Morris Berman took a picture of Tittle right after the hit. In the photo, Tittle looked very tired, hurt, and sad. This photo became very famous because it showed a different side of sports - not just the exciting action, but also the tough moments that players go through. Even though Tittle was hurt in that game, he still played the rest of the season. The famous photo is now in a special place called the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and people remember it as an important moment in sports history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:A directive to shut the Dadaab camp and forcibly repatriate about 260,000 Somali refugees living there was issued last year. The deadline for its closure had been extended until May, but a high court judge ruled the decision was tantamount to an act of group persecution. The government says it will appeal against the ruling on security grounds. It said that attacks on its soil by the Somalia-based al-Shabab group had been planned in the camp. \\"The camp had lost its humanitarian nature and had become a haven for terrorism and other illegal activities,\\" Kenyan government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. \\"The lives of Kenyans matter. Our interest in this case, and in the closure of Dadaab refugee camp, remains to protect the lives of Kenyans,\\" he added. Dadaab was set up in 1991 to house families fleeing conflict in Somalia, and some people have been living there for more than 20 years. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and lobby group Kituo Cha Sheria challenged the decision in court, saying it was discriminatory and contrary to international law. \\"The government's decision specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional,\\" Judge John Mativo said. The orders are excessive, arbitrary and disproportionate, he said. The BBC's Nancy Kacungira in the capital, Nairobi, says the ruling means the government has to start putting in place mechanisms that will restore regular operations at the camp even though it will launch an appeal. Kenya's refugee department had already been shut, which meant that new-born babies were not being registered as refugees, Said Abuka, a community leader and refugee in Nairobi, told the Associated Press news agency. Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying it affirmed Kenya's legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution. \\"Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses,\\" the rights group's Muthoni Wanyeki said in a statement. Mr Kiraithe said since the closure of Dadaab was announced, more than 51,000 Somalis had voluntarily returned to Somalia. \\"We are encouraged that Somalia continues to stabilise politically more so with the election of a new president,\\" he added. Somalia's 'Mr Cheese' president has a lot on his plate Somalia's UN-backed government, with the help of a 22,000-strong African Union force, is battling Islamist group al-Shabab to regain control of the country. But it has only managed to secure major towns. The militants, who impose a strict version of Islam in the areas they control, still mount deadly bombings and have carried out a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya. Kenya is currently building a fence along its 700km (435-mile) border with Somalia, but has completed only 4km so far.

To elaborate more on why statistical surveys are essential, consider the following points: 1. Informed Decision-Making: Statistical surveys provide essential data that can be used to make informed decisions. By understanding the distribution, trends, and patterns within the data, colleagues can develop new strategies, improve existing practices, and even identify any potential problems that may need to be addressed urgently. 2. Encouraging Collaboration: Conducting a statistical survey requires teamwork and coordination among the group members. This process fosters cooperation and collaboration, as members must rely on each other's skills, knowledge, and capabilities to gather accurate data and insights. 3. Enhanced Understanding: Statistical surveys can reveal surprising or non-intuitive insights about the subject being studied. This new information can help to refine existing knowledge, challenge assumptions, or perhaps aid in generating novel ideas or approaches. 4. Benchmarking Progress: Once the initial survey is completed, the data can serve as a benchmark for future surveys, allowing the team to track progress over time. Monitoring changes and progress is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of implemented strategies or pinpointing any areas that need improvement. 5. Efficient Allocation of Resources: The data obtained from statistical surveys can help identify where resources should be better allocated, ensuring that time, personnel, and funding are directed towards the most promising projects or tasks. Overall, conducting a statistical survey can prove to be highly beneficial, promoting evidence-based decision-making, teamwork, and better understanding among team members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thus, a simple straight wire antenna will have one polarization when mounted vertically, and a different polarization when mounted horizontally. As a transverse wave, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's \\"polarization\\" is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google is not directly related to the appearance of an 1873 silver dollar coin. Let me provide a detailed description of the 1873 silver dollar for you. The 1873 silver dollar coin, also known as the Morgan Dollar or Trade Dollar, was minted in the United States between 1873 and 1885. The Trade Dollar was specifically designed for international trade, especially with the far East, while the Morgan Dollar was intended for domestic circulation. Both the 1873 Morgan Dollar and the 1873 Trade Dollar share some common features. They are both made of 90% silver and 10% copper, and have a diameter of 38.1 millimeters. However, their appearances differ in terms of design and weight. Here is a description of both coins: 1. 1873 Morgan Dollar: - Obverse (front): The Morgan Dollar features a profiled portrait of Lady Liberty facing left, designed by English engraver George T. Morgan. Around the border of the coin, you'll find the inscription \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM,\\" which means \\"Out of Many, One\\" in Latin, along with 13 stars representing the original 13 colonies. The minting year \\"1873\\" is located at the bottom. - Reverse (back): The reverse side of the Morgan Dollar showcases a beautifully detailed heraldic eagle with outspread wings, grasping arrows and an olive branch in its talons. The eagle is surrounded by a wreath, with the words \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" and \\"ONE DOLLAR\\" inscribed around the border. Some of the coins also have a mint mark letter ('S', 'CC', or 'O') to indicate the mint at which they were produced - San Francisco, Carson City, or New Orleans, respectively. 2. 1873 Trade Dollar - Obverse (front): The obverse of the 1873 Trade Dollar, designed by William Barber, also features Lady Liberty but, in this case, she is seated and facing the viewer's right. She is holding a shield with the inscription \\"LIBERTY\\" and an olive branch in her left hand, while her right hand is extended over a small globe. The words \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\" appear above her head, and the minting year \\"1873\\" is inscribed below her. - Reverse (back): The reverse side of the Trade Dollar depicts a majestic eagle holding an olive branch and three arrows, surrounded by the words \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" and \\"420 GRAINS .900 FINE\\". The denomination of \\"ONE DOLLAR\\" is found at the bottom of the coin. As with the Morgan Dollar, a mint mark appears on certain coins, depending on where they were minted. In summary, the 1873 silver dollar coin is available in two different designs: the Morgan Dollar and the Trade Dollar. While they share some similarities, they have distinct appearances and were intended for different uses."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Little Big Man Context: In the present day 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), who resides in a hospice, is recounting his long and colorful life story to a curious historian (William Hickey). Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole survivor of Custer's force at the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior. Jack is given the name \\"Little Big Man\\" because he's short but very brave.In 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers after skirmish between them and the local Cheyenne. Jack then renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself from being killed.

If your dog looks pleased to see you - it is probably because it loves the particular way you smell. The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household. The familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else... According to the passage, a dog will be most interested in _ .

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Here is the step-by-step analysis and justification for this question: Step 1: Analyze the given sentences: - Sentence 1 states that they (referring to a group or entity) cut welfare rolls. - Sentence 2 gives a reason for cutting welfare rolls (adding more money to senior services). Step 2: Establish the relationship between the sentences: - Sentence 2 provides more context and information about Sentence 1.

So, knowing that the welfare rolls were cut doesn't necessarily mean that the second sentence is automatically true without any further information to support it.

The Beatles on iTunes was a big deal -- so big, in fact, that the band carried music sales to a rare year-over-year increase. Music sales in the United States were up 1.6 percent through May 8, according to Nielsen Soundscan. More than half of those sales went to digital retailers, as physical album sales continued to plummet. Although Nielsen doesn't have specific sales figures for digital Beatles tracks, the patterns are pretty obvious. Sales of catalog music -- old stuff, that is -- shot up immediately in November, when The Beatles hit iTunes, and has continued to see year-over-year growth in every month since. The Beatles' catalog landed on iTunes November 16, after years of rumors, speculation and drama. The deal between Apple, Apple Corps (The Beatles' publisher) and record label EMI is reportedly exclusive through some time this year. When Apple announced the news, skeptics wondered whether there were any Beatles fans left in the world who hadn't already purchased physical albums or resorted to piracy. This is silly. There are plenty of people who don't want to go the illegal route, either for reasons of morality or convenience, and the fact that these people could suddenly buy their favorite Beatles tracks from a smattering of albums was a huge development. It just goes to show that if you give people what they want and make it easy to buy, they will hand over their money. That's something for other digital music holdouts -- AC/DC, Garth Brooks and Bob Seger among them -- to consider. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Beatles' arrival on iTunes has significantly impacted music sales, leading to a rare year-over-year increase in the United States. The increase in sales can be observed after the Beatles' catalog was made available on iTunes in November. This has led to a growth in catalog music sales, which consist of older music. Digital retailers gained more than half of the sales, while physical album sales continued to decline. This indicates that there is still a significant number of fans who prefer to acquire their music legally and conveniently. The success of the Beatles on iTunes suggests that providing easy access to sought-after music can drive sales and should be considered by other digital music holdouts, such as AC/DC, Garth Brooks, and Bob Seger."},{"prompt":"Information: - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe. - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails . - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer. - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\". - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900 23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. What is the relationship between 'bob mendes' and 'belgium'?

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To paint a doll with something that resembles blood, you can Pick your answer from: --Use red paint on the doll to create something resembling blood --Use blue paint on the doll to create something resembling blood","completion":"To paint a doll with something that resembles blood, it is recommended to use red paint on the doll as this will create a much more convincing and realistic depiction of blood. Using blue paint would not be an accurate representation of blood and may not look as believable. Below are detailed steps to achieve a blood-like effect using red paint on a doll. 1. Gather materials: To begin, you'll need to gather the required materials. You'll need a doll, red paint (preferably acrylic), a paintbrush, a disposable plate or palette to mix the paint, water, a tissue or paper towel, and a work surface covered with a drop cloth or newspaper. 2. Choose the right shade: To make a realistic blood color, choose a deep red shade of paint. An optional step to make it appear more realistic is to mix in a small amount of black or brown paint to create a slightly darker and richer hue. 3. Test the paint: Before applying the paint to the doll, test it on a small piece of paper or fabric to ensure that you're satisfied with the color and consistency of the paint. The paint should be thick and dark, resembling real blood. If necessary, adjust the mixture accordingly. 4. Prepare the doll: Ensure the doll is clean and free of any dirt or dust. This will help the paint adhere better to the surface. If the doll has any clothing or accessories, it's best to remove them to avoid getting paint on these items. 5. Apply the paint: To create a realistic blood effect, use a paintbrush to apply the mixture to the areas of the doll where you want the blood to appear. Begin by dabbing the paintbrush on the surface to create an irregular, dripping, or splattered effect. Blood is not always evenly distributed, so adding some splatters, smudges, and drips can enhance the overall visual impact. 6. Use varying techniques: To achieve different blood effects, like dried blood, use a slightly darker shade of red, and apply it using a more controlled, dabbing motion. For fresh, wet blood, use a brighter red shade and create generous amounts of paint in select areas. This will give the appearance of freshly spilled blood. 7. Blend the paint: If needed, use water and a clean brush to gently blend the paint on the doll. This will help create softer edges and ensure the paint appears natural on the surface. Be careful not to over-blend, as this may cause the paint to lose its intended effect. 8. Add final touches: Using a small detail brush or a toothpick, you can further enhance the blood effect by carefully drawing thin blood trails or additional splatter patterns. 9. Let the paint dry: Allow the paint to fully dry before touching or moving the doll. Acrylic paint usually takes between 20 to 30 minutes to fully dry, but it might take longer depending on the thickness of the paint layers. 10. Seal the paint: If you want to protect and preserve the paint job, you can finish the process by applying a clear, matte or satin varnish on the painted areas. This will prevent the paint from chipping or rubbing off over time. By using red paint to create a blood-like effect on the doll, you can achieve a striking and realistic appearance that resembles actual blood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
