Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the man that appointed his brother as viceroy after taking easter Deccan? is inside the article: Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and..., can you guess it ?

Plot title: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls Movie plot: After failing the rescue attempt of a raccoon in the Himalayas (a parody of the opening to the film Cliffhanger), Ace Ventura undergoes an emotional breakdown and goes on a personal soul-searching quest by becoming a Tibetan monk. He is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace, normally an animal lover, must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case. He travels to the Wachati tribal village, where he learns that Shikaka is meant as a wedding present from the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince. If the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe instead. Much of Ace's activity involves eliminating various suspects and enduring the problems of dealing with the Wachati and the Wachootoo, who refer to him as the \\"white devil\\". This proves difficult, and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him. Reduced to the limit of his ability to solve mysteries, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection.Advised by the Abbot, Ace finally discovers that Vincent Cadby had taken the bat and hired Ace as a cover for his own crimes.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Mistakes can help you learn, but only if you make sure they are corrected. For example, if you use the wrong ingredient while cooking, be sure to ask your mother or a knowledgeable person about the correct way to use the ingredient, so that you can revise the information in your memory. It can be helpful to write down when, where, and how you're making mistakes in your life. This will create additional awareness of your patterns, which may be difficult to notice in the heat of the moment. Carry a small pocket journal around with you and make note of times that you did something wrong. Review the entries later when you have free time, and explore options for what you could have done differently. For example, if you're working on a new recipe and things keep going poorly, make a note of where you're messing up. Think about it later that evening and see if you can come up with ways to prepare the dish differently. You should also keep track of your successes. You will be more motivated to continue learning despite making mistakes if you can track your progress over time and celebrate what you're good at. A solely negative focus is unhelpful. “Be-good” goals set unrealistic expectations for yourself, especially if you're just starting out with an activity. If you set “be-good” goals, you are raising the stakes and telling yourself that you need to succeed in order to be a good person. “Get-better” goals, on the other hand, are all about improvement. With these goals, you don't need ridiculously high achievements in order to feel good about yourself. You're aiming for improvement, not perfection. For example, focus on the “get-better” goal of learning how different spices affect the taste of food, rather than the “be-good” goal of being a master chef right off the bat. Time isn't the only ingredient necessary to learn from your mistakes. You will also benefit from going forward with a specific purpose. This is why it's important that you locate your mistakes and the reasons behind them. Being aware of what you're doing wrong, and why, will help you create a plan to practice and increase your competence. For example, if you're trying to perfect a basic cooking skill like boiling pasta, do it over and over until you get the timing right. It may take a while to get the desired softness of the pasta, but the more you practice, the closer you will get. There's no shame in asking for help with something you haven't gotten the hang of yet. Putting your ego aside and learning from someone who has more experience than you is a great way to improve, especially if you find yourself in a rut and don't know how to proceed. For example, ask a chef at your favorite restaurant or a family member with a lot of cooking experience if you are having trouble with a cooking basic. Research suggests that people who believe they can learn from mistakes are actually more likely to learn from mistakes. Knowing that it's possible for you to learn from mistakes is a good step toward actually doing it. After a mistake such as burning a dish, tell yourself “I can learn from this. It’s possible to use this experience. Now I know to use a lower oven temperature.” We’re told not to make excuses for our mistakes, but that's different from knowing about the reasons for our mistakes. If a meal you are cooking doesn't come out right, it's okay to recognize the fact that you made a mistake such as not following the recipe closely enough or reaching for the salt instead of sugar. That's a reason, not an excuse. Searching for the reasons behind your mistakes can help you do better in the future, because it will show you where you went wrong. Some more reasons to look out for: Being late to events because of not getting up early enough. Getting written up for messing up a project because you didn't ask for clarification. Failing a test because you neglected to study, or didn't prioritize your studying well. Sometimes all it takes to learn from a mistake is one pass. This isn't always the case, however. Many times, in order to learn from a mistake, we have to make it several times over. It can be difficult to catch on at first, so give yourself leeway to make the same mistake a few times before getting frustrated.","completion":"To effectively learn from mistakes, document and analyze them, adopt a \\"get-better\\" goal mindset, practice self-awareness, seek expert guidance, and understand that improvement may require making the same mistake multiple times before mastering a skill."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time. Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three. From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian. The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance. Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation. Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own. Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans. In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world. In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films.

Lindsey puts a lot of sugar in their coffee while Tanya puts none as","completion":"Lindsey puts a lot of sugar in their coffee while Tanya puts none as they both have distinctive preferences and tastes when it comes to their coffee consumption, shaped by factors such as culture, personal experiences, and taste sensitivity. Coffee, which is known for its strong and complex flavor, is consumed by millions of people globally, and each person has their unique way of enjoying it. The differences in people's coffee preferences can be attributed to several factors, including culture, upbringing, and individual taste preferences. In the case of Lindsey and Tanya, their coffee preferences may have been influenced by their cultural backgrounds. Different cultures have their ways of enjoying coffee, with some preferring it black and strong while others like it sweetened. For instance, Italians are known for their love of a rich, robust espresso that's typically unsweetened. Conversely, people from the Middle East and the Balkans traditionally enjoy coffee with sugar, sometimes even adding spices like cardamom. Another factor contributing to the difference in coffee preferences between Lindsey and Tanya could be their upbringing and personal experiences. An individual's exposure to coffee begins early, with family traditions and rituals playing an essential role in shaping our tastes. If Lindsey grew up in a household where sweetened coffee was the norm, such as the popular café con leche in the Hispanic culture, this could play a significant role in their preference for putting sugar in their coffee. Tanya, on the other hand, may have been raised in a family that enjoyed unsweetened black coffee, which would explain her preference for no sugar. Taste sensitivity is another significant factor that can impact a person's coffee preferences, particularly when it comes to sweetness. People have different thresholds for detecting sweetness, which is largely influenced by their genetic makeup. Individuals with a higher sensitivity to sweet tastes might find unsweetened black coffee too bitter and may opt for added sugar to balance the flavor, like Lindsey. In contrast, those with a lower sensitivity to sweetness may find sweetened coffee overwhelming and prefer their coffee without sugar, similar to Tanya. Lastly, it is also worth considering that Lindsey and Tanya's preferences may simply be reflective of their enjoyment of the different flavor profiles that coffee offers. Lindsey might appreciate the comforting sweetness and smooth texture produced by adding sugar, while Tanya could enjoy the bold, intense flavors of black coffee, with its acidic, bitter, and fruity notes coming through more prominently without the addition of sugar. In conclusion, Lindsey's preference for sweetened coffee and Tanya's penchant for black coffee can be attributed to a combination of factors, including culture, upbringing, taste sensitivity, and individual taste preferences. Understanding and respecting these differences is crucial in appreciating and celebrating the diversity of coffee experiences around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Newmarket is widely regarded as the global headquarters of Thoroughbred horseracing and the birthplace of the sport in Britain. The town itself has a rich history, with strong connections to British royalty and elite society since the 17th century. The National Horseracing Museum, now known as Palace House, can be found at Palace Street, Newmarket, Suffolk, CB8 8EP. It occupies a unique location, as it is housed within the last remaining part of the extravagant sporting palace complex established by King Charles II in the 1660s. The museum's mission is to showcase the history and culture of the sport and to educate visitors about the art, history, and science of horseracing. The exhibits cover everything from the early days of horse breeding, racing, and training to modern techniques and technology advancements. In addition to exploring the sport's longstanding connection to British royalty, the National Horseracing Museum also highlights the role of jockeys, trainers, owners, and the horses themselves in shaping the sport's rich history. The Palace House facililty is spread across multiple sites. The main museum occupies the Trainer’s House and the King’s Yard, while the neighbouring Fred Packard Galleries and Mews present an extensive collection of British sporting art and elaborate horse-drawn carriages, respectively. Additionally, visitors can witness live demonstrations of horse training and equine care at the Rothschild Yard, where retired racehorses are cared for by the Retraining of Racehorses charity. The National Horseracing Museum is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in horseracing or British history. It not only offers an in-depth look at the evolution of the sport but also showcases the pivotal role that Newmarket has played in shaping horseracing worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A fuel pump is a frequently (but not always) essential component on a car or other internal combustion engined device. Many engines (older motorcycle engines in particular) do not require any fuel pump at all, requiring only gravity to feed fuel from the fuel tank or under high pressure to the fuel injection system. Often, carbureted engines use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank, whereas fuel injected engines often use electric fuel pumps that are mounted inside the fuel tank (and some fuel injected engines have two fuel pumps: one low pressure/high volume supply pump in the tank and one high pressure/low volume pump on or near the engine). Fuel pressure needs to be within certain specifications for the engine to run correctly. If the fuel pressure is too high, the engine will run rough and rich, not combusting all of the fuel being pumped making the engine inefficient and a pollutant.

Please answer this question: where is the g protein linked receptor located?","completion":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), are a large and diverse group of protein receptors that are found across the eukaryotes - from yeast to humans. They play a vital role in many different biological functions. GPCRs are typically located in the cell membrane or plasma membrane that surrounds the cell. The plasma membrane, the boundary between the cell and its environment, makes an excellent location for proteins involved in communication and signaling, such as the GPCRs. The term \\"G protein-coupled receptors\\" gives some indication as to how these proteins operate within the cell. They comprise of a single polypeptide that threads back and forth through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane seven times. This is why they are also referred to as seven-transmembrane receptors. The structure of a GPCR consists of an extracellular N-terminus, followed by seven transmembrane helices connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops ending with an intracellular C-terminus. The transmembrane helices create a pocket in the cell membrane in which signaling molecules, or ligands, can bind. Upon ligand binding, GPCRs undergo a conformational change, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR exchanges the GDP bound to the G protein for a GTP. The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13). Therefore, GPCRs can interact directly with “G proteins” on the interior of the cell when a signaling molecule binds to them. This initiates an internal signal transduction pathway which leads to various cellular responses. GPCRs are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. Some examples of their physiological roles include: the senses of vision, smell, and taste, regulation of immune system activity and inflammation, behavior and mood regulation, and regulation of blood pressure and heart rate among many others. Their fundamental role in so many biological functions also makes them a common target for pharmacological intervention, with an estimated 34% of all prescription drugs targeting GPCRs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: No. 1 Prep QB Is Jewish Kid On Catholic Team, Kin Of Wharton School Founder The nation's best high school quarterback attends St. John Bosco High School outside Los Angeles. He goes to confession twice a semester, attends team Mass before games, huddles for post-practice prayer sessions, journeys on faith-based retreats and takes an annual religion class -- typical obligations for a student-athlete at an all-boys, Catholic high school. And he is Jewish. Meet Josh Rosen. \\"He's really respectful,\\" said St. John Bosco senior guard Matthew Katnik. \\"He sits when he has to, stands when he has to.\\" The UCLA-bound Rosen also stands out as a quarterback with Jewish roots. Though Benny Friedman and Sid Luckman -- playing before the 1950s -- made the Hall of Fame, Jay Fielder and Sage Rosenfels are the only two modern-era Jewish NFL quarterbacks. When asked if he takes pride in being part of a select group of noteworthy Jewish quarterbacks, Rosen, who calls himself \\"kind of an atheist\\" and whose mother is a Quaker Christian, brushes it aside. \\"(I) just happen to have that kind of background,\\" he said. \\"There really isn't too much to it.\\" There, however, is no downplaying his accomplishments on the high school level. Rivals.com's No. 1 ranked quarterback (and No. 2 ranked player overall) in the 2015 class, Rosen has thrown for 5,287 yards, 61 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. The 6-4, 210-pounder with a quick release and great pocket presence completed 68.6 percent of his passes for 3,200 yards, 39 touchdowns and just seven interceptions while leading Bosco to a 16-0 record and a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) state title last year. Rosen, 17, is one of the best quarterbacks in years from the Southern California area, a region that has produced Heisman Trophy winners, first-round draft picks and NFL starting quarterbacks. \\"I have seen a lot of quarterbacks in my career -- Mark Sanchez, Matt Leinart and Matt Barkley and some of those really, really talented guys,\\" Bosco coach Jason Negro said. \\"Josh is every bit as talented as those individuals.\\" Legendary Mater Dei High coach Bruce Rollinson, who coached Barkley and Leinart, saw Rosen's entire throwing repertoire -- the touch pass, the mid-range pass and the deep ball -- firsthand as he lost to Bosco twice, 24-2 and 34-7, last year. \\"He's everything that the press has been speaking about,\\" Rollinson said. \\"He's a force to be reckoned with.\\" The senior will showcase his skills Aug. 22 when Bosco begins its season against Saint Louis (Hawaii) School at Honolulu's Aloha Stadium. There Rosen will orchestrate Bosco's explosive no-huddle, spread attack. \\"We are definitely at another level in terms of our ability to be sophisticated offensively,\\" Negro said. \\"We're able to do so much because of the intelligence of our quarterback.\\" His intelligence extends off the field. The son of a Penn-educated father -- spine surgeon Dr. Charles Rosen -- and a Princeton-educated mother -- former journalist Liz Lippincott -- Rosen has a cumulative 4.3 GPA. He took four AP classes and Honors Pre-Calculus last year. (He's not allowed to take as many AP classes this year since he would have to drop them halfway through, because of his early enrollment at UCLA.) \\"He doesn't mind helping other people that have trouble understanding something,\\" said Katnik, who took AP U.S. History and AP Physics with Rosen. \\"He's a really smart kid.\\" Rosen's AP credits apply toward his UCLA degree requirement, part of the reason he wanted to attend the California state school. That allows him to either graduate in three years and enroll in the UCLA Anderson School of Management's MBA program as a senior -- or graduate in three years and enter the NFL. Either way he is prepared for the next phase in life. Rosen seemed destined to play quarterback. Before he turned 1, he was constantly throwing things from his crib, including one time when Lippincott entered his room, after his nap. \\"He launched his bottle,\\" she said. \\"I swear it almost knocked me out.\\" Though a natural passer, his first love was tennis. Sponsored by Wilson Sporting Goods, he earned a top 10 ranking in junior tennis and traveled the country for national tournaments. He even quit football in sixth and seventh grade to focus on tennis. \\"That was my sport,\\" Rosen said. \\"Tennis was what I really wanted to do.\\" But because of the repetitive swings, he suffered overuse injuries (scapula dyskinesis and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit or GIRD) to his shoulder during winter nationals in Arizona. He avoided surgery, and his throwing shoulder healed. But his tennis interest waned, and he sought a team-oriented sport at a school. (Most elite tennis players don't attend four-year colleges; many are even homeschooled through high school.) Football became his game, and -- with the exception of playing on the Bosco team last year -- he has not played tennis competitively since junior high. His athletic gifts come from his parents. A nationally ranked ice skater, Charles Rosen competed in the sport until he was 20 and narrowly missed making the Winter Olympics in the mid-1970s. Lippincott captained the Princeton lacrosse team. \\"There's a genetic component to athletes,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"And he's got two jocks as parents.\\" In addition to the athletic bloodlines, Josh Rosen has an impressive lineage. His mom's great-great-great grandfather was Joseph Wharton. The patriarch of one of the many Quaker families who became successful business entrepreneurs -- including the founders of Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays -- Wharton manufactured iron and nickel, co-founded Bethlehem Steel and established Wharton, University of Pennsylvania's renowned business school. The Rosens vacation at the Whartons' Jamestown, Va., home every summer. Joseph Wharton's daughter, Joanna, married Philadelphia publisher J. Bertram Lippincott in 1887 and named their oldest son Joseph Wharton Lippincott. Liz's father was the last family CEO of noted publishing house J.B. Lippincott & Co, which was later acquired by Harper & Row, and Josh -- whose full name is Josh Ballinger Lippincott Rosen -- is named after the publisher's founder. \\"We don't usually use (the full name) just because it's kind of pretentious,\\" Liz joked. \\"It's just for the family sentimentality.\\" While combining those Quaker roots and Jewish upbringing, Josh had a Bar Mitzvah and attends Seder every Passover, but he also celebrates Christmas. \\"My parents are pretty awesome in letting me kind of pick my own path,\\" Rosen said, \\"and letting me believe what I want to believe.\\" Perhaps that's why Rosen has enjoyed learning the perspective of different religions and philosophies while at Bosco, the school recommended by friend and current Cal WR Bryce Treggs. Rosen recently completed a nine-page paper entitled \\"What is the good life?\\" Bosco has about 820 students, and that includes Mormons, Baptists and several who hail from Polynesia. The football program has around 210 players, and last year's center, Elijah Zabludoff, was Jewish. That gave the Catholic school the unusual distinction of having an all-Jewish, center-quarterback exchange in 2013. Though Bosco has provided a comfortable environment for someone raised Jewish, Rosen, who self-deprecatingly said he has \\"got a relatively big nose,\\" has received derision about that from opposing teams. \\"I've gotten some slurs here and there,\\" Rosen said, \\"but not anything too bad. It's all fun and games.\\" Rosen declined to delve further. And whether it was just meaningless trash talk as he insinuated or something more nefarious, it's a far cry from the injustices experienced generations ago. During his late-teens, Charles Rosen remembers clearly outskating opponents -- but then ending up behind them in the final rankings. One notion was that the United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) wanted to present less ethnic looking skaters as All-American champions during the Cold War era. \\"It used to be difficult in athletics sometimes if you were Jewish,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"That was 30 years ago, and things change.\\" Rosen will enroll at UCLA early, starting college in the winter quarter after graduating high school, following the fall semester. The opportunity to start as a true freshman was a major reason he chose UCLA. The Bruins are slated to have an open QB competition to replace Heisman Trophy candidate Brett Hundley, with whom Rosen visits whenever he swings by the UCLA campus. Bosco runs a similar offense to UCLA. The Bosco staff has visited that school, along with Oregon and Arizona State, during the past couple years, and those programs greatly influenced Bosco's attack, which is predicated on its quick pace. \\"That's one of the reasons Josh is going to be such a good fit at UCLA,\\" Negro said. Despite possessing the large frame of a dropback passer, Rosen is adept at running the zone-read. He burned Mater Dei during the teams' playoff game last year, breaking tackles to the tune of 11 carries for 113 yards. \\"He really had a tremendous all-around game -- running, throwing,\\" Rollinson said. \\"He was on fire.\\" That shows that even when high school opponents try to disguise coverages on the back end, Rosen will find a way to lead his team to victory. It's a trait he began showcasing as a sophomore, after playing on the JV as a high school freshman. On fourth-and-goal with 3:11 remaining and Bosco down 17-10 to Notre Dame (Calif.) High in the 2012 CIF Pac-5 Division Quarterfinals, Rosen rolled right and connected on a nine-yard, pylon route to A.J. Holman to tie the game. He then led the team down the field to score the game-winning touchdown with 1:19 left. \\"That was pretty much the defining moment,\\" Negro said. \\"We knew he was going to be special.\\" Rosen is certainly an exceptional case, but while many may focus on a talented Jewish quarterback leading a Catholic school, ideologies are secondary for the heralded passer. \\"They could be praying to Zeus every time at those games,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"And he wouldn't care as long he gets to throw a football.\\" -- Follow Jeff Fedotin on Twitter @JFedotin.

Manufacturers often put warnings like \\" wash with like colors \\" or \\" color rubs off \\" on the labels of garments that are at risk of bleeding in the wash. If the label is unclear or your garment is old and you're not sure whether it will bleed, set it aside to be tested.","completion":"To conduct a quick color bleeding test at home, gather a plain white cloth or paper towel and a small, inconspicuous part of the garment in question (such as an inside seam), then dampen the garment slightly with water. Firmly press the white cloth or paper towel against the damp area of the fabric and hold it there for approximately 30 seconds. After releasing the pressure, examine the white material – if there has been a transfer of color onto it, you should treat the garment as if it is prone to bleeding during washing. Utilize proper preventive measures, such as washing the item separately or with similar colors, using cold water, and opting for color-safe detergents, in order to minimize the risk of color bleeding and to maintain the vibrant hues of your clothing for as long as possible. Additionally, consider investing in laundry color catchers, which are specially designed sheets that can be added to your washing machine to absorb any excess dye and further prevent the transfer of color to other garments in the same load."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Given the question: Answer the question based on the following text. Question: When looking at a hill, Shane sees that the sand on the steep slopes is finer or thicker? Text: Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep. The answer is:","completion":"When looking at a hill, Shane sees that the sand on the steep slopes is finer than on the less steep slopes. This observation can be deduced from the provided text, which states that smaller sediments are deposited as the slope becomes less steep. This implies that, on the steeper sections of the hill, the sand particles would be smaller and fine-grained, while on the gentler slopes or flat areas, the particles would be larger and thicker. The reason behind this phenomenon is related to the processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediments. On a steep hill, gravity plays a significant role in moving sediments down the slope. The larger and heavier particles have higher inertia and, as such, require greater force to overcome their resistance to movement. However, the smaller and lighter particles can be more easily mobilized due to their lower inertia. Consequently, when a hill slope is steep enough, finer particles can be easily transported downhill, leaving behind the coarser and heavier sediments. As the hill slope becomes less steep, the gravitational force acting on the sediments decreases, and the transportation capacity of the slope diminishes. This means that the smaller, fine-grained particles are more prone to be deposited in these areas as they no longer possess the adequate momentum required to maintain their downhill movement. Additionally, the water flow on a steep slope tends to be more turbulent and faster, allowing it to carry smaller sediments more easily. In contrast, the water flow on less steep slopes is generally slower, leading to the deposition of finer particles. In summary, when Shane looks at a hill, he will notice that the sand on the steep slopes is finer, while the sand on the less steep slopes is generally thicker due to the varying transportation and deposition capacities of the slopes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Which member of the band threw a pig head at the posers? from the following article ? In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying.

Please answer the following question: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways. Which country caused more marine litter? Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to definitively determine which country caused more marine litter without comprehensive data, but we can make some observations based on the information provided. Croatia, with an economy based on tourism and fishing, might produce less agricultural runoff than Italy. Agricultural runoff, including fertilizers and livestock waste, causes chemical pollution, hypoxia, and dead zones. However, tourism and fishing activities might still contribute to marine litter through the improper disposal of waste, such as plastic packaging, food waste, and fishing gear. Italy, with an economy based on conventional agriculture, is more likely to produce greater amounts of agricultural runoff, as mentioned above. This would contribute to chemical pollution, hypoxia, and dead zones. Although agriculture is the primary focus, tourism, shipping, and other human activities could still lead to the generation of marine debris. While both countries contribute to marine pollution, it seems that Italy might have a more significant impact on chemical pollution and hypoxic conditions in the sea due to its agricultural activities. However, both countries can still contribute to marine litter through tourism, fishing, and other human activities. To provide a more accurate conclusion, a detailed comparative study on the quantity and type of marine litter and pollutants caused by the two countries would be needed.

Article: Everyone wants to know the secrets of a long and healthy life. Here are some discoveries from health experts. Many studies looking into the lives of centenarians look at what they eat. Many people who live into their hundreds live in the Mediterranean , so their diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, gets a lot of attention. The diet has been linked to a healthier older age, lower risk for heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a supporter of the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to land better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean job-stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that plenty of hard workers lived long lives. \\"Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really are enjoying life.\\" the authors write, \\"We found that productive, hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people that matter to us may help us take better care of ourselves, some evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is improved when we are around our friends, and that they help with stress management.

These characters significantly contributed to the popularity of Timely Comics in the 1940s and played a crucial role in the superhero genre's development during the Golden Age of Comic Books. Captain America, created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, made his first appearance in Captain America Comics #1 in 1941. He quickly became a popular and beloved character, as the patriotic superhero resonated with American readers during World War II. Steve Rogers, the frail young man who received the Super-Soldier Serum to become Captain America, represented the quintessential American hero and served as an inspiration in the fight against tyranny and injustice. The Human Torch, created by Carl Burgos, was an android with pyrokinetic abilities, first appearing in Marvel Comics #1 (which later became Marvel Mystery Comics) in 1939. The character gained popularity due to his visually striking powers and his unique nature as a sentient android with human emotions. His character paved the way for the android and artificial intelligence concepts that would become common in superhero stories later on. Namor the Sub-Mariner, the half-human, half-Atlantean hybrid, was created by Bill Everett and first appeared in Marvel Comics #1 in 1939. Hailing from the underwater city of Atlantis, Namor was one of the first anti-heroes in the superhero genre, often using his superhuman abilities for both good and ill purposes. His conflicting loyalties between his Atlantean heritage and the human world provided a complexity that made the character appealing and intriguing to readers. In summary, the most popular early Marvel heroes, known as the \\"big three,\\" were Captain America, the Human Torch, and Namor the Sub-Mariner.

Summarize this article: Flimsy, lightweight fabrics may seem breezy and casual, but they can cling to your body and actually become a bit uncomfortable. Fabrics that are a bit more substantial will make you look svelte and smooth. They offer support while also concealing any lines from undergarments. You don’t need to write off fabrics like silk and cotton forever, but be sure to try different fabrics to find what feels best to you. As a heavily obese girl, it may be tempting to stay in a certain fashion comfort zone. There is nothing wrong with embracing a flowy, boho style, but try on other options too. The next time you go out clothes shopping, take something you wouldn't normally wear into the fitting room with you. You may like something you never expected to! You don’t need to buy any of the clothing you try, and you don’t need to show anyone. Just try to be open-minded about other styles of clothing. Remember, you won’t know how something looks on you unless you give it a try. You can dress according to your body type and abide by fashion tips, but at the end of the day, you should show off whatever you want to show off! If you love your shoulders, expose them in a plunging off the shoulder top. If you love your backside, wear a formfitting skirt to boast your behind. You know better than anyone what you’re working with, so highlight your best features. Don’t be afraid of bright colors – just make sure that the clothing fits appropriately! For a sleek look, try creating monochromatic outfits with various textures. If you want to wear stripes, opt for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background. Vertical stripes will help you look slimmer than horizontal ones as well. If you particularly love a part of your body, wear fun, bright patterns on other parts to draw attention to it. While it's fun to highlight, accentuate, and maximize certain features, try not to worry about minimizing others. If there's an area of your body that you may not love as much as others, try something radical and show that area off! Dress to make yourself feel happy and confident, not to follow fashion \\"rules\\" or to hide your body. Summary:","completion":"The article suggests that choosing more substantial fabrics can provide support and conceal undergarment lines, making one look smoother and slimmer. It encourages experimenting with different clothing styles and materials to find what feels best. For those who may be heavily obese, trying on new clothing styles outside their comfort zone could lead to discovering new favorites. Being open-minded about fashion choices can lead to finding appealing options that enhance one's best features. Embracing different styles enables individuals to confidently showcase parts of their bodies that they love. The article also recommends opting for monochromatic outfits and vertical stripes for a sleeker appearance and using bright patterns to draw attention to favorite body parts.

Does \\"He adds that the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet was one of the reasons why the Mongols pounced on the chance to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and \\"fill once more the political vacuum in that country.\\" correctly answer the question of When did the conquest of Tibet reach its peak?","completion":"The provided statement does not directly answer the question of when the conquest of Tibet reached its peak. The statement discusses the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet contributing to the Mongols seizing the opportunity to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and fill the political vacuum that had been created. However, it does not provide a specific time frame or date for when the peak of the conquest took place. To provide a detailed and accurate response, the conquest of Tibet can be examined in relation to different historical periods. If we focus on the Mongol conquest of Tibet, it is essential to talk about Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) in China. The Mongol conquest of Tibet reached its peak during his reign as he extended the Mongol Empire and established a relationship between the Yuan Dynasty and Tibet. In 1244, the Sakya leader Sakya Pandita was invited to Kublai Khan's court, and in 1254, his nephew Phagpa was invited as well. In 1260, Kublai Khan became the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and he officially named his nephew Phagpa as the Imperial Preceptor in 1264. Subsequently, Kublai Khan integrated the Tibetan spiritual and political authority into the Yuan government, which enabled direct control over Tibet. In this historical context, the peak of the conquest of Tibet under the Mongol reign can be considered between 1260 and 1280. However, if referring to the later efforts to reclaim Tibet, the discussion is different. The provided statement mentions the Mongols pouncing on the chance to reclaim Tibet due to the Ming Dynasty's lack of concern. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Chinese authority maintained a relatively distant and less military-oriented relationship with Tibet, which led to the political vacuum the statement refers to. In this context, Altan Khan, a Mongol leader, established a new relationship between the Mongols and the Tibetans in the 16th century. In 1578, Altan Khan met with the Tibetan leader Sonam Gyatso and granted him the title of 'Dalai Lama,' which means 'Ocean of Wisdom.' This marked the beginning of the lineage of the Dalai Lamas, who would become the spiritual and political leaders of Tibet. After Altan Khan's efforts to consolidate power in Tibet, it can be said that the peak of the Mongols reclaiming their influence over Tibet occurred in the late 16th century. In summary, the conquest of Tibet reached its peak under the Mongol control during Kublai Khan's reign in the 1260s and 1280s. However, the reclaiming of Tibet by Mongols can be considered at its peak during the late 16th century when Altan Khan forged a new alliance with the Tibetans. It's important to note that the given statement helps provide context about political influences in Tibet during the Ming Dynasty but does not directly answer the question about the peak of Tibet's conquest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What makes a genius so smart? What makes a genius? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Both questions are certainly related, but they have slightly different implications. Primarily, they inquire about the factors that contribute to someone being considered a genius and the characteristics typical of a genius. To address these questions meaningfully, I will discuss them individually while highlighting their relationship. 1. What makes a genius so smart? A genius is typically considered an exceptionally intelligent person who has extraordinary cognitive abilities, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills. There are several factors that contribute to a genius being smart: a. Genetics: Studies have shown that intelligence has a genetic component, with some estimates suggesting that about 50-75% of intelligence is heritable. This means that a genius could have inherited their extraordinary intelligence from their ancestors. b. Brain structure and function: Research has found that the brains of highly intelligent people often have unique structural and functional characteristics. For example, the corpus callosum, which connects the two brain hemispheres, can be larger in geniuses, facilitating quicker communication between the two halves of the brain. Moreover, geniuses may have denser gray matter, which contributes to greater neural efficiency, capacity, and cognitive ability. c. Early cognitive development: Certain factors during childhood can have a significant impact on a person’s cognitive abilities. Early exposure to stimuli and challenging environments can promote brain development and contribute to improving cognitive skills. Many geniuses have shown exceptional cognitive abilities from a young age, such as an aptitude for learning new skills or processing information quickly. d. Hard work and commitment: High intelligence alone does not determine genius-level accomplishments. A strong work ethic, dedication, perseverance, and the drive to explore, learn, and innovate contribute significantly to a genius’s intellectual capabilities. e. Environment: Growing up in an environment that nurtures curiosity, learning, and creativity can play a crucial role in the development of a genius. Supportive and engaging educational experiences, mentorship, and opportunities for skill development can all contribute to an individual reaching their intellectual potential. 2. What makes a genius? The term \\"genius\\" goes beyond mere intelligence, indicating one’s extraordinary abilities or talents in multiple domains. Some factors characteristic of a genius might include: a. Creativity: A genius usually possesses a high degree of creativity, using their knowledge and intelligence to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions and ideas. b. Insight: Geniuses often demonstrate a profound understanding of complex topics, simplifying and explaining them in a manner that demonstrates their depth and clarity of thought. c. Originality: A genius may bring forth new and unique ideas, challenging existing norms and paradigms and revolutionizing their fields. d. Impact: The work of a genius often has a significant impact on society, culture, or knowledge in their area of expertise. This influence may be felt for generations, shaping the future in meaningful ways. e. Intuition: Geniuses often have a heightened sense of intuition that allows them to make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, fostering new perspectives and ideas. In conclusion, while both questions are closely related in exploring the nature of a genius, the first question focuses on the factors that contribute to their extraordinary intelligence, whereas the second question expands on this to include the broader characteristics of a genius. These characteristics encompass their creativity, originality, impact, and more, setting them apart from those with just exceptional cognitive abilities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, I first translate \\"we believe\\" and \\"there is no alternative to it\\" into Turkish. \\"We believe\\" translates to \\"inanıyoruz\\" and \\"there is no alternative to it\\" translates to \\"buna alternatif yok.\\" 3. Next, translate \\"a strong partnership\\" to \\"güçlü bir ortaklık\\". In Turkish, adjectives usually come before the nouns they modify. 4. The phrase \\"both countries\\" translates to \\"her iki ülke\\". In this case, \\"both\\" is an adjective and precedes \\"countries\\". 5.

Help as much as you can. Q: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment. How is thermal mass used to keep buildings cool?","completion":"Thermal mass is used to keep buildings cool by acting like a big sponge that can soak up heat during the day and release it at night. In simple words, it helps store the heat from the sun in materials like stone, cement, or water. When the sun shines during the day, these materials absorb and hold the heat. Later, when the temperature gets cooler at night, the stored heat slowly comes out of the building, making the inside of the building feel cooler. This way, the thermal mass helps to keep the building comfortable without using extra machines to cool or warm it up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more.

The toy wants to fly away, but the string keeps it close. That's kind of how it works with Saturn and the Sun. The Sun's gravity is like the string that pulls Saturn closer, and Saturn's movement is like the spinning toy. So, Saturn hangs around because of the Sun's gravity.

Alan Barron, 59, from Monroe, Michigan, was placed on paid administrative leave two weeks ago after an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School sat in on Barron's lesson about Jim Crow racial segregation laws. As part of the lesson, Barron showed the class a video about the use of blackface by white performers of the time to imitate African Americans. Barron is very pleased that he will be allowed to return to the classroom and the students that he has dedicated the past 36 years of his career to,' Mr. OPTIONS: - African Americans said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Alan Barron said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Barron said in a statement released through his lawyer. - James Gordon said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Jim Crow said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Kirk Maltais said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Michigan said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Monroe said in a statement released through his lawyer. - Monroe Middle School said in a statement released through his lawyer.","completion":"Alan Barron, a 59-year-old middle school history teacher from Monroe, Michigan, was recently suspended for teaching his students about the history and use of blackface in entertainment during the 1800s. This controversial topic was a part of his lesson on Jim Crow racial segregation laws and their impact on African Americans. During the class, Barron presented a video that depicted white performers from the time utilizing blackface to imitate African Americans, an offensive and derogatory practice. The suspension occurred two weeks prior when an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School attended Barron's class and observed the lesson in progress. As a result, Barron was placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. This decision sparked outrage among both parents and students at the school, who organized a protest in support of the veteran teacher. As a dedicated educator with 36 years of experience, it is understandable that many found the suspension to be an overreaction. The lesson on blackface and racial segregation was designed to educate students about the historical context and the prejudice that was prevalent during that era. Presenting this information in a comprehensive manner allows students to better understand and learn from the mistakes of the past. After the protest by parents and pupils, Barron was allowed back into the classroom to continue teaching. In a statement released through his lawyer, Barron expressed his gratitude, saying, \\"I am very pleased that I will be allowed to return to the classroom and the students that I have dedicated the past 36 years of my career to.\\" The case demonstrates the complexity of addressing sensitive historical topics in educational settings. While it is essential for students to learn about the unfortunate and painful aspects of history, educators must consider diverse perspectives and approach such topics with the utmost care. In Barron's case, allowing him to return to the classroom can be seen as a testament to his commitment to providing students with a comprehensive education. Nevertheless, it also serves as a reminder that educators and institutions must handle delicate subjects with care, ensuring that these discussions contribute to fostering empathy, tolerance, and a broader understanding of historical context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: On my first day in America, I was excited, but nervous as well. It was my dear neighbor Susan who helped me get used to my new life far away from home. There was a knock at the door. When I opened it, Susan came in with a home-made apple pie. She hugged me and said:\\"You must be the precious Chinese doll!\\" With a big smile, she went on:\\"Alice, I am sure you have never, ever tried a home-made apple pie before! You are going to love it so much!\\" To be honest, I was greatly surprised by this welcome from a stranger. And the apple pie made me feel at home. Susan was very helpful to me. When I was thinking about a costume to wear on Halloween, she suggested I dress up like a traditional Chinese girl. \\"I happen to have a traditional Chinese dress and guess what, I am a great make-up artist!\\" she said. Susan didn't hide her excitement, when, after an hour of hard work, she pushed me to the mirror to examine our work. The clothes fit me perfectly! I am sure that I _ from the crowd that Halloween, and I am very grateful to Susan for her help. My first Thanksgiving was another highlight. On the festival morning, I was surprised to find a gift box in my front yard. There was a note on it:\\"Hello Alice, I am the Thanksgiving bunny! Enjoy your gift!\\" I looked around and caught Susan looking at me from the porch. Seeing that she had been caught, she awkwardly picked up a newspaper and pretended to read it. I couldn't help laughing. When I walked up to her, she said:\\"It was not me. It was the Thanksgiving bunny!\\" Susan is such a lovely person; she is the American above all others I need to thank. I saw that the spirit of the Chinese saying, that \\"Neighbors carry more weight than distant relatives,\\" is alive and well in America. Susan filled my heart with warmth and joy, just as angels do.

LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Some 700 people have been killed in clashes with Islamic militants in Nigeria, a military commander told CNN. Bodies of hard-line Islamic rebels killed in battle lie in a Nigerian city. Civilians and troops also have died. The fighting in the northeast Nigerian town of Maiduguri began with attacks by the Muslim militants on police and government targets, starting a week ago. Col. Ben Ahonotu, commander of the operation to combat Islamic militants, gave the new total. Previous reports said at least 400 rebels, troops and civilians had died in the region, including Borno, Yobe, Kano and Katsina states. Maiduguri is in Borno state. Ahonotu did not elaborate or provide further information, and it was unclear whether the 700 was in addition to the previous death toll. Attacks on police and government targets have been reported throughout the region. Boko Haram, an Islamist sect, wants the government to impose Islamic law, known as sharia, in the entire Muslim-dominated northern half of Nigeria. Sharia is already practiced in some northern states, but the sect wants even tougher religious laws and also opposes Western education. The southern half of Nigeria is predominantly Christian. A Boko Haram leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was reported captured Thursday by the military, but was found dead after he was turned over to police. Human rights groups are seeking more information on his death, and have also expressed concern about civilian casualties. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

OPTIONS: * yes; * it is not possible to tell; * no;","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that she is an orphan of the Voth war. This implies that because of the Voth war, she lost her parents and became an orphan. While it does not specifically state her parents have been killed, we must consider the contextual meaning of the phrase \\"orphan of the Voth war.\\" The term \\"orphan\\" typically means a child whose parents have died. An important point here is that she is referred to as an orphan \\"of the Voth war,\\" which goes beyond just being an orphan generally. The statement suggests that the war is the crucial factor that caused her to become an orphan. It would be reasonable, considering the context of a war, to infer that her parents died directly or indirectly as a consequence of the war, although the specific circumstances that led to their deaths may not be clear. Hence, while the premise does not explicitly mention that her parents were killed in the Voth war, it does entail the hypothesis that her parents died because of it, leading her to become an orphan. This connection is inferred by the reader's understanding of what it means to be an orphan and the context of the war within the statement.

The Wales Co-operative Centre will operate the Social Business Wales project, backed by £6m in EU funding and £5m from the Welsh government. It says social businesses \\"often fill the gaps the private sector won't consider and the public sector can't support\\". Social enterprises include ventures set up with a community focus and have a strong presence in deprived areas. Nearly a third operate in the health and social care sector, and similarly in culture and leisure. The project aims to help 500 businesses, including co-operatives, worker-owned companies and social enterprises. It will also help charities take forward commercial ideas. The investment comes at a time when more than two thirds of Welsh social businesses expect to increase their turnover in the next two to three years. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said: \\"The social business sector plays an important role in supporting local economies, particularly in disadvantaged areas.\\" Chief executive of the Wales Co-operative Centre Derek Walker added: \\"We believe that social businesses have great potential for further growth in Wales.\\" CASE STUDY: 'WE KNEW WE WERE DOING SOME GOOD' The project announcement is being made at the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) - a social business in Neath. It works with firms and organisations to make sure websites, apps and other digital media are accessible to people with visual and mobility impairments, dyslexia and learning disabilities. The business provides work for people with disabilities and has a client list which includes Fujitsu, Santander and Channel 4. How long has DAC has been going and how many people work there? Gavin Evans, director of operations: We have been operating for nearly four and a half years and have 21 employed staff and four volunteers at present. Explain what a social business is - how does it differ in how you are set up and operate? My understanding of a social business is that the organisation requires investment in order to have some form of social gain. We have commercial and social missions and goals, the social impact being the big focus. We reinvest 100% our profits back into the business, as we operate on a not-for-profit basis. We initially placed all the investment in ourselves, and had some small amounts of funding for computer equipment from Welsh funding organisations. We operate on a commercial basis, we sell our services. However, with investment and a good business plan, we can do a whole lot of more social good. Any advice for someone thinking of setting up a social enterprise? I think the key advice to offer is to have belief and confidence in what you are doing. When Cam (other co-founder and director) and myself set up the company, the first few months were extremely difficult. But we knew we had a good model and, after all, we knew we were doing some good. I think that is key really, to know that there is a socially-beneficial goal at the end of it, and believe in what you are doing will benefit the wider community. DAC does this by ensuring other organisations' digital products are accessible to everyone. However, we also provide sustainable employment for individuals with disabilities. So there are two key drivers for us really.","completion":"A big project called Social Business Wales will help create 500 new jobs in the next five years. They are giving £11 million to help special businesses called \\"social businesses.\\" These businesses are nice because they help people in the community and care about more than just making money. They are very common in places where people have less money and jobs. The project will also help charities make money from their ideas. This is good news because many social businesses in Wales think they will grow in the next few years.

Question: If walruses have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body, then what has a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body? Answer choices: - walruses - bears - the Sun - water - rabbit - ice - animals - humans Answer:","completion":"Among the answer choices provided, walruses, bears, rabbits, some other animals and humans have a layer of fat under their skin to help insulate the body. 1. Walruses: As you mentioned, walruses have a thick layer of blubber or fat beneath their skin, which serves as a valuable insulation mechanism to keep them warm in their cold, marine environments. This blubber layer can be up to six inches thick, providing an efficient thermal barrier between the walrus's core internal organs and the frigid ocean waters. 2. Bears: Similarly, bears also have an adipose tissue layer (or fat layer) beneath their skin that acts as insulation to help them maintain their body temperature during hibernation or when living in cold climates. This fat reserve not only keeps them warm but also serves as a source of energy during the lean winter months when food is scarce. 3. Rabbits: Rabbits living in colder climates, such as the Arctic hare, also possess a layer of fat under their skin to provide insulation. This fat layer, combined with their dense fur, allows them to survive in extreme environmental conditions. 4. Other animals: Many animals that live in cold environments have evolved to have a layer of fat under their skin for insulation and energy storage. Examples include seals, whales, and some species of penguins. These animals typically have a thick, insulating layer of blubber or fat that helps them conserve heat and stay warm in frigid aquatic or terrestrial habitats. 5. Humans: Humans, too, have a layer of subcutaneous fat under their skin that helps insulate and protect the body from cold temperatures. This fat layer provides a barrier between our internal organs and the cold external environment, helping maintain a stable core body temperature. In addition to insulation, the subcutaneous fat layer also serves other vital purposes, such as supplying energy, shock absorption, and protection for internal organs. However, it is important to note that the presence and thickness of this fat layer can differ significantly between individual animals and humans due to factors such as genetics, diet, and adaptation to specific environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Verbs show action or indicate a state of being. As in other languages, verbs need to be conjugated to match the number of people performing them. You'll also need to put verbs in past, present, or future tense to indicate the time in which the action was performed. For example: In the sentence, “I thought I locked the gate,” thought and locked are both past-tense verbs. In the sentence, \\"I want to open the door,\\" want and open are both present-tense verbs. In the sentence, \\"The girls admit they lied,\\" admit is in its plural form. Were you only talking about 1 girl, you would say, \\"The girl admits that she lied.\\" An adverb describes an action or an adjective (or another adverb in some cases). Adverbs show when, to what extent, and how a specific action was performed. Most, but not all adverbs end with “-ly.” Examples of adverbs include: How: “Sam quickly ate his lunch,” or “Bertram moodily shaved his mustache.” To what extent: “Jennie did her homework excellently,” or “The cat was very furry.” When: “Tom went to his lessons weekly,” or “Adele never cut her hair.” The “-ly” ending is usually used for adverbs that derive from adjectives (such as “hungrily” from “hungry” or “gently” from “gentle”). Adverbs that do not follow this form include “too,” “very,” “never,” and “often.” You can use adjectives to modify nouns and, occasionally, pronouns. These words answer questions about nouns like: what kind? which one? how many? Examples of adjectives include: You are a great person. The tall man was late for the meeting. Her smelly cat ruined the house party. The iguana is a terrible pet. Your mother is a kind woman. When adjectives are used to modify pronouns, they usually need a helping verb such as is and are. For example, “They are interesting,” or “He is tall.” In rare cases, adjective forms can be used to modify another adjective (a job that is typically done by adverbs). For example, “He drove a bright red car.” Determiners are a special form of adjective that are used to provide information about nouns, such as specificity, number, and distance from the speaker. For example, if you want to indicate specificity, use a definite or indefinite article. You would use the definite article “the” when you're referring to 1 particular example of a specific noun (e.g., “the book”). Use “a” if you're referring to any example of a that kind of noun (“a book”). The most common types of determiners include: The definite article the (singular or plural) and the indefinite articles a or an (singular) or some (plural). These articles show whether the noun they modify is specific or general. For example, “The [specific] man wanted some [general] apples.” The demonstrative adjectives, which indicate both specificity and proximity to the speaker. This (singular) and these (plural) refer to specific nouns that are close to the speaker. That (singular) and those (plural) suggest a little more distance. For example: “Put these [specific, close] books with those [specific, more distant] papers over there.” Numbers are also a form of determiner, which can specify the quantity of a noun. For example, “I have twenty-three cats in my bedroom!” Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the functions and forms of various parts of speech in English, including verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and determiners, with examples demonstrating tense, plurality, descriptive properties, and specificity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet.

[1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"Hi there! Let's break down your questions one by one so we can understand them clearly. First, you're asking about the style of painting in a work by Vladimir Volegov. Vladimir Volegov is known for painting in a realistic style, which means his paintings look like real life. It's like seeing a photograph, but it's created with paint instead. His paintings often show people and their emotions, making them feel alive and real. Second, you're asking if the painting is a copy of someone else's work. I can't see the actual painting you're talking about, but Vladimir Volegov usually creates his own original paintings, which means they come from his own ideas and not copied from others. A copied work is when one artist tries to imitate another artist's painting, making it look the same, but a painting by Volegov would usually be his own original creation. Lastly, you're asking if the two questions have the same meaning. The answer is no, they do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the style of the painting (realistic), while the second question is about whether the painting is a copy of someone else's work. In summary: 1. The painting by Vladimir Volegov is likely in a realistic style. 2. The painting is probably not a copy of someone else's work. 3.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What organs make up the digestive system and where does it start?\\" is \\"It starts at the mouth and includes the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's correct. The digestive system starts at the mouth and includes various essential organs, which are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine (comprising the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and large intestine. All these organs work together in a coordinated manner to ensure the efficient breakdown and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume, as well as to eliminate solid waste from our body. Digestion begins in the mouth with the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, and continues in the stomach, where it is further processed. The small intestine is responsible for most of the chemical digestion and nearly all nutrient absorption. Finally, the large intestine absorbs water and excretes any remaining undigested waste."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A rocket fired from California intercepted and destroyed a target warhead fired toward Alaska from the other side of the Pacific Ocean. It was the first-ever test of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system on a fast-moving \\"ICBM-range target.\\" “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent,” the director of the Missile Defense Agency says. The 244 million test was the first since 2014, according to NBC News. It was conducted amid increased worry of a potential nuclear attack from North Korea. Despite Tuesday's success, there are many questions surrounding the viability of the GMD system during an actual attack. Only nine of the previous 17 tests since 1999 had been successful, Reuters reports. And that's with tests being scripted for success: daytime launches with personnel informed of the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory. It's also possible North Korea could use decoys to trick the system; the GMD's interceptor rockets haven't been tested against decoys. A Pentagon spokesperson says the GMD system is just one way the Pentagon has of shooting down a potential North Korean missile. The GMD system has cost US taxpayers more than 40 billion so far. Expand this summary.","completion":"In June 2017, the United States successfully carried out a test of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, an event that US officials called \\"an incredible accomplishment.\\" The test involved a rocket being fired from California to intercept and destroy a target warhead fired towards Alaska from across the Pacific Ocean. The trial, the first-ever of the GMD system involving an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-range target, cost 244 million and demonstrated that the US has a \\"capable, credible deterrent\\" against a possible nuclear attack, according to the director of the Missile Defense Agency. The successful test was the first since 2014 and took place amid heightened concern over the potential threat of a nuclear strike from North Korea. The situation highlights the importance of an efficient missile-defense system, which demonstrates that the United States is prepared to counter any missile threats. However, despite the success of this test, there remain several questions about the GMD system's actual viability during an attack. Since 1999, only nine of the previous 17 tests had been successful, which raises concerns about the reliability of the system. Furthermore, these tests were carried out under controlled conditions, with launches taking place during the day and personnel being informed about the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory, making the tests easier to execute than under real-world circumstances. Additionally, the GMD system has not been tested against decoys, a tactic North Korea could potentially employ to trick the system and enable its missiles to bypass the US defense measures. The issue of decoys is particularly crucial, as the North Korean regime has been known to invest in decoy technology for their weapons systems. Consequently, it is essential to develop and test the GMD system against decoys to ensure its effectiveness in a real attack scenario. It is crucial to note that the GMD system is not the sole method of missile defense at the Pentagon's disposal. There are other defense mechanisms designed to shoot down potential North Korean missiles, such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. Together, these missile defense systems form part of a layered approach to countering missile threats. Nevertheless, the GMD system has cost US taxpayers more than 40 billion, a significant investment that implies the need for it to be a reliable defense measure. With the increasing unpredictability and aggression of potential adversaries, maintaining and improving the US' ballistic missile defense system is a matter of national security. It is essential to ensure the GMD system's effectiveness in real-world situations by addressing the issues of decoys and improving the success rate of tests, so that it can act as a robust deterrent and protect the United States from potential missile threats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether it's a splash of red wine, a smudge of ketchup, or a drop of coffee, stain removal can prove to be a tricky task. To help you tackle the most stubborn of stains, we have prepared a step-by-step guide on how to use a laundry pre-treatment stain remover and follow the correct washing and drying procedure. By following these instructions, you'll be able to enjoy clean and spotless clothes in no time. Step 1: Apply a laundry pre-treatment stain remover Before you toss your stained clothing into the washing machine, it's essential to pre-treat the stain with a suitable stain remover. This step is crucial for several reasons: - It helps break down the stain and makes it easier to remove during the wash cycle. - Some stains may become more difficult to remove if they are washed without pre-treatment. - Pre-treating will increase the effectiveness of your detergent and reduce the need for multiple washes. To apply the pre-treatment stain remover, follow these guidelines: 1. First, choose the right stain remover based on the type of stain and the fabric of your garment. For example, enzyme-based stain removers are great for protein-based stains like blood or sweat, while oxygen-based removers work well on colored stains like red wine or fruit juice. 2. Apply the stain remover directly to the stained area, making sure to follow the product's instructions. 3. Rub the stain gently with a soft brush or your fingertips to work the stain remover into the fabric. 4. Allow the stain remover to sit for the recommended amount of time, typically ranging from a few minutes to an hour. This step ensures that the stain remover has enough time to break down the stain. Step 2: Wash the garment using the cycle and temperature on the care tag Once the stain remover has been applied, it's time to wash the garment in your washing machine. To do this: 1. Check the care tag on your garment to determine the recommended wash cycle and water temperature. Following these instructions will help preserve the lifespan and quality of your clothing while effectively removing stains. 2. Add your regular detergent and any fabric softeners or other laundry additives you typically use. 3. Insert the garment into the washing machine and start the cycle according to the care tag’s recommendations. Step 3: Wash the garment again if the stain remains If, after the first wash cycle, the stain remains, it may be necessary to repeat the process. Simply reapply the pre-treatment stain remover and put the garment through another wash cycle, using the same settings recommended on the care tag. Step 4: Dry the garment once the stain is completely gone Before drying your garment, double-check to ensure the stain has been entirely removed. If necessary, repeat the pre-treatment and washing steps until you're satisfied with the results. Drying a garment with a stain still present can set the stain and make it even more challenging to remove later. Once you're sure the stain has been removed, follow the drying recommendations on the garment's care tag. This may mean air-drying the clothing or using a specific dryer setting. Conclusion: By following this step-by-step guide to effectively removing stains from your clothes, you'll be able to save your favorite garments and maintain their appearance for years to come. Remember to always pre-treat stains with a suitable stain remover, wash according to the care tag's recommendations, and only dry the garment once you're sure the stain has been removed. With a little patience and attention to detail, removing stains will become a breeze."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

I've always liked Columbo, though, somehow without even having seen that much of him. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968, the latest(and probably not last) of the films was made in 2003. That's 35 years. And Falk was 40 back when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films(unless my count is off), all of which are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema. That is quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning(though that may be the same for all of the Columbo films), leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it, making it somewhat dull(since there's not much to look forward to at the end of the film). The pacing is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored. The acting is very good, particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialog in the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The dialog and script is unusually good for a TV-movie. All in all, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV-movie, and definitely worth watching for any fan of Columbo and/or crime/mystery flicks. 8/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Physical conditioning: Baseball requires a combination of strength, speed, agility, and endurance. Alex should engage in regular physical training to build muscle, improve coordination, and increase stamina. 4. Develop a consistent batting approach: To achieve a .500 batting average, Alex will need a personalized and consistent batting approach that maximizes their chances of making contact with the ball. This may include refining their swing mechanics, stance, and overall plate approach. 5. Practice patience at the plate: Recognizing good pitches to hit and avoiding chasing after bad ones is crucial. Alex should learn to be patient at the plate and make smart decisions about which pitches to swing at. 6. Work on pitch recognition: Alex will need to develop the ability to quickly recognize different types of pitches, such as fastballs, curveballs, sliders, and changeups. This skill will help them anticipate where the ball will be and make contact more effectively. 7. Develop a strong mental game: Baseball is a sport with a lot of ups and downs. Alex will need to learn how to handle adversity, maintain focus, and stay confident throughout the season. 8. Learn from experienced coaches and players: To develop a more comprehensive understanding of the game and improve their skills, Alex should consult with experienced coaches and players who can provide valuable advice and guidance. 9. Participate in organized baseball: Prior to the spring baseball season, Alex should play in organized leagues, tournaments, or camps. These experiences will provide essential game experience and help Alex get used to playing with a team. 10. Set realistic goals and commit to consistent improvement: Alex should regularly evaluate their performance, identify areas for improvement, and set achievable goals throughout the season. By setting goals and working to improve every aspect of their game, Alex will be better prepared to achieve a .500 batting average during the spring baseball season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Good quality pencils and paper will definitely help - the next article will show you the pencil grades, and how to get the most from them. Happy drawing!\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Tone and Utilizing the Complete Tonal Range in Your Drawings Introduction As artists, color and tone play a significant role in expressing our ideas and emotions on paper. Creating the perfect balance of light and darkness in our drawings can be challenging for beginners and experienced artists alike. By understanding the tonal scale and mastering the technique of incorporating the different shades, you can create visually striking and well-rounded artwork. In this article, we'll delve deeper into tone, highlighting the importance of the lightest and darkest tones in your drawings, and offer some tips for getting the best results with quality pencils and paper. Deciphering the Tonal Scale: Light and Darkness At its most basic definition, tone refers to the relative darkness or lightness of a color. When creating a drawing, using the tonal scale from 1 to 10 helps in ensuring you have the right balance between the lightest and darkest shades. However, it's essential to remember that not every drawing requires all ten tones. One of the most important elements to keep in mind is Tone Number 1, often represented by the pure white of your paper. This pure white, together with the darkest tone, provides you the complete tonal range to work with in your drawings. To create depth, beginners can face and conquer their fears of utilizing the darkest tone in their artwork by observing pure white tone No. 1 and other their own drawings. Comparing and contrasting different shades will help artists gain the confidence they need to incorporate all tonal values in their work. Why the Lightest and Darkest Tones Matter The lightest and darkest tones of your art play a crucial role in creating depth, contrast, and visual texture. Tones can both enhance or subdue the features of your subject and your composition. Whether you are drawing landscapes, portraits, or still-life scenes, having a well-balanced tonal range will strengthen the overall viewing experience. Using good quality pencils and paper will pave the way for achieving better results. The next section will discuss pencil grades and how to effectively use them to maximize your potential as an artist. An Introduction to Pencil Grades and Paper Quality Understanding pencil grades is essential for utilizing the full capabilities of your drawing equipment. Pencil grades vary depending on the hardness or softness of the graphite core. Harder pencils have a higher proportion of clay and lower levels of graphite, whereas softer pencils contain more graphite and less clay. Typically, the pencil grades range from 9H (hardest) to 9B (softest). Choosing the right pencil grade for your drawing depends on your intended outcome, whether you want to create lighter or darker tones, or if you want crisp, fine lines or bold, thick strokes. Quality paper is also crucial when it comes to bringing out the best in your artwork. As an artist, you should carefully select the right paper depending on the techniques you intend to use, such as blending, layering, or graphite application. The three main factors to consider when choosing the suitable paper are weight, texture, and color. Conclusion To become a skilled artist, mastering the depth, contrast, and visual appeal of your art through the tonal scale is vital. Gaining the confidence to utilize the lightest and darkest tones effectively will allow you to elevate your artwork to new heights. Don't be afraid to explore your drawing tools and experiment with paper choices to ensure the foundation for your drawings is strong and supportive. Remember, the path to improving your art lies in understanding the importance of tonal range, selecting the right pencil grades, and choosing the appropriate paper to unveil the hidden potential in your drawings.

Background: William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and professional wrestling magnate. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Context: Following a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer , Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan's old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \\"is still a work in progress.\\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003. In 2004 Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \\"a mean spirited drug addict,\\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \\"indie cred\\" and calling them \\"filthy\\", opportunistic, and selfish. On September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published Blinking with Fists, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title The Confessions of Billy Corgan. Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released.

Let's provide detailed answers to both questions separately. Question 1: How to stop feeling suicidal? If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, it is crucial to seek help immediately. Here are some steps you can take to stop feeling suicidal: 1. Reach out for help: Talk to a mental health professional, a counselor, a doctor, or a trusted friend or family member about your feelings. Do not hesitate to call a suicide hotline if needed. 2. Develop a support network: Surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you, and who can offer emotional support during difficult times. Building positive connections is crucial in combating suicidal thoughts. 3. Make a safety plan: Create a plan outlining what steps you'll take when experiencing suicidal thoughts. This plan should include contact information for your support network, strategies to remind you of reasons to live, and the necessary steps to remove access to lethal means. 4. Focus on self-care: Pay attention to your physical and emotional well-being. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, eat a balanced diet, participate in physical activities, and engage in relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga. 5. Challenge negative thoughts: Replace negative thought patterns with positive ones. This may involve working with a therapist who can teach you Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. 6. Identify and address underlying causes: Many factors can trigger suicidal thoughts, such as depression, anxiety, trauma, or substance abuse. Working with a mental health professional to determine and manage these underlying causes is essential. 7. Stay busy: Engage in activities that bring you joy or a sense of accomplishment, such as hobbies, volunteering, or work projects. Staying active can help redirect your thoughts and provide an outlet for stress. Remember that recovery takes time, and it is crucial to have patience and perseverance.

These experiences can provide you with insights into your future career and help you develop professional skills. 5. Network with professors and experts in your field: Attend conferences, seminars, and guest lectures to engage in intellectual discussions with professionals in your area of interest. 6. Develop a growth mindset: Rather than view yourself as inherently smart, cultivate a growth mindset by embracing challenges and learning from your mistakes. This perspective will encourage you to seek out new experiences and continually improve your skills. 7. Find balance and embrace self-care: To avoid burnout and maintain overall well-being, ensure you make time for physical activity, relaxation, socializing, and fun.

What is the answer?","completion":"The 1960 film 'The Alamo' featured Richard Widmark in the role of Jim Bowie. Richard Widmark was an American actor and producer who enjoyed a long and successful career in the film industry. Born in 1914, Widmark made his film debut in 1947 with the movie 'Kiss of Death', in which he played the character Tommy Udo, a villainous role that earned him an Academy Award nomination. From there, Widmark went on to appear in numerous films across various genres, including drama, western, and adventure. 'The Alamo' was directed by John Wayne, who also starred in the film as Davy Crockett. The movie is a historical drama that portrays the Battle of the Alamo, a critical event in the Texas Revolution that took place in 1836. The film's plot revolves around a group of Texan soldiers and volunteers, including the legendary Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett, and William Travis, who fought against the Mexican Army led by General Santa Anna. The film was a significant undertaking at the time, with a large budget (12 million), a running time of over three hours, and a star-studded cast which, in addition to Richard Widmark and John Wayne, featured Laurence Harvey as William Travis, Frankie Avalon as Smitty, Patrick Wayne as Captain James Butler Bonham, and Linda Cristal as Graciela Carmela Maria 'Flaca' de Lopez. Although 'The Alamo' received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success and went on to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards, including Best Picture. However, it only won one award, for Best Sound. Despite this, the film remains a popular and memorable representation of the events surrounding the Battle of the Alamo and is remembered for its engaging performances, including that of Richard Widmark as the iconic Jim Bowie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: Why is Shyamal promoted? For his 'efficient' handling of the crisis Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Efficient Crisis\\" Genre: Thriller, Drama Main Characters: 1. Shyamal - A young and dedicated professional working at a prestigious company. 2. Mr. Mehra - The CEO of the prestigious company. 3. Reena - Shyamal's supportive and caring co-worker. 4. Darren - A jealous and competitive colleague. 5. Mrs. Kapoor - The head of the Human Resources department. Plot: Step 1: Setup The movie opens with a glimpse of a thriving prestigious company with driven employees, including Shyamal, who aspire to climb the corporate ladder. Shyamal, known for his efficiency and quick problem-solving abilities, works tirelessly to maintain his impressive work record. Reena, his co-worker, admires and supports Shyamal's efforts, believing in his potential to do great things at the company. Step 2: The Crisis A sudden crisis hits the company – a data breach threatening to tarnish its reputation and jeopardize the company's future. Mr. Mehra announces that employees must band together to mitigate the damage and restore the company's image. Shyamal, seeing an opportunity, volunteers to spearhead the crisis management. Step 3: The Team Shyamal forms a task force consisting of Reena and other colleagues, including Darren, to plug the data breach and prevent further damage. Reena and Shyamal work seamlessly while maintaining constant communication. Darren, however, harbors resentment towards their synergy and Shyamal's dedication, feeling overshadowed by Shyamal's competence. Step 4: Navigating the Crisis Under Shyamal's leadership, the team conducts an intensive investigation. They identify potential sources of the data breach, implement security measures, and communicate transparently with affected clients. As the investigation progresses, the team encounters various obstacles and uncertainty, during which Shyamal's calm and strategic approach keeps them level-headed and motivated. Step 5: Darren's Sabotage Feeling left behind in Shyamal's shadow, Darren secretly plants false evidence implicating Shyamal as the source of the data breach. The information reaches Mr. Mehra and Mrs. Kapoor, who call Shyamal for questioning. Shaken by the allegations, Shyamal adamantly denies any wrongdoing, and Reena stays loyal to his side. Step 6: Shyamal's Redemption Determined to clear his name, Shyamal and Reena work against the clock to uncover the real culprit behind the data breach and the planted evidence. Their thorough investigation leads them to Darren, who finally confesses in front of Mr. Mehra and Mrs. Kapoor. Step 7: Climax With the truth revealed and the crisis averted, Shyamal is exonerated and hailed as a hero for his efficient handling of the situation. As a reward for his efforts, Mr. Mehra grants Shyamal a well-deserved promotion. Darren, on the other hand, faces justice as he is fired and his career prospects crumble before him. Step 8: Resolution Having proved his worth, Shyamal gracefully assumes his new leadership role with Reena by his side. Together, they continue to work diligently, guiding the company to greater heights and proving that dedication, efficiency, and integrity can overcome even the most challenging adversities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle tightens?\\" Answer: \\"Decreases\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, based on the paragraph, the correct answer is: When the diaphragm muscle tightens, the size of the chest increases."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Staying in our apartment on the North Shore of Vancouver, we were tucked into a sleepy, suburban idyll where once off the busy highway, kids played ball games in the street and cats strolled around their own home territories without a care in the world. It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.) Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches. That blur below? A local black squirrel who was foraging amongst the cooing tourists for snacks… About 20 minutes later his grinning face floated back into view, and he brandished his phone with images of his quick wander through the trails. Lynn Canyon Park officially opened to the public in 1912; there are several trails throughout the park to choose from for a leisurely hike including the popular Baden Powell Trail and there are also many breathtaking waterfalls and popular swimming holes which are perfect during the summer months.

A:","completion":"The answer to the question of which player has had more singles appearances, Casey Dellacqua or Olga Morozova, necessitates an analysis of their respective tennis careers, background, and competitive records. Before getting into specifics, let's first take a quick look at each player's profile. Casey Dellacqua, an Australian professional tennis player, was born on February 11, 1985. Her career spanned a period from 2002 to 2018. Dellacqua achieved her highest singles ranking of No. 26 on September 29, 2014. Throughout her career, she primarily focused on doubles but still made notable impressions in singles competition. Olga Morozova, a former professional tennis player from the Soviet Union, was born on February 22, 1949. Her career spanned a period from 1966 to 1982. Morozova attained her highest singles ranking of No. 18 in 1975. She was a prominent figure in the international tennis scene during the 1970s, with significant singles achievements alongside her doubles success. To answer the question of which player had more singles appearances, we must refer to their careers and tournaments played. Casey Dellacqua's main draws in singles competition, across all levels, include: 1. Grand Slam Tournaments - 34 appearances 2. WTA Tour Tournaments - 87 appearances 3. WTA 125K Series - 5 appearances 4. ITF Circuit Tournaments - 72 appearances In total, Casey Dellacqua had 198 singles appearances across all levels throughout her career. Olga Morozova's main draws in singles competition, across all levels, include: 1. Grand Slam Tournaments - 41 appearances 2. International Tennis Federation (ITF) Tournaments - 115 appearances (estimate, based on win-loss records, as complete appearance data is not available) In total, Olga Morozova had approximately 156 singles appearances across all levels throughout her career. However, it is important to note that Morozova played during a time when the structure of women's professional tennis was significantly different than Dellacqua's era; the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) was not established until 1973, and many tournaments were not classified under the ITF, WTA, or Grand Slams as they are today. The actual number of Morozova's singles appearances could be higher, but some data may be missing or not officially recorded. By comparing the data available, we can conclude that Casey Dellacqua had more singles appearances (198) than Olga Morozova (approximately 156). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the potential impact that the evolution of women's tennis and the lack of comprehensive records from earlier years may have on accurately comparing these two players."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yet, some find the strength to persist, not solely for survival but also for living a meaningful life amidst the challenges. In County Antrim, a courageous woman has astoundingly decided to return to work while continuing her rugged battle against cancer. The story recounts her hope for more support for fellow cancer patients and survivors in similar positions. By highlighting her journey, this article aims to share light on the significance of a supportive framework for cancer patients who wish to reintegrate into their professional lives. The Spirited Warrior: A County Antrim Woman's Bravery When the news of a cancer diagnosis shadows one's world, it becomes nearly impossible to envision a future that resembles their previous life. Fear, uncertainty, and despair often cloud the dreams and aspirations, relegating them to the backdrop. Yet, this formidable woman from County Antrim stands tall amidst the turmoil, resiliently deciding to return to work and take charge of her life. It is beyond doubt that her exceptional courage is inspirational for countless cancer patients and survivors who may seek to regain their professional lives' momentum. With her indomitable spirit, she sends out a powerful message: the battle against cancer need not be waged alone, nor must it confine cancer patients to the sidelines of their own lives. The Need for a Supportive Infrastructure for Cancer Patients in the Workforce The journey of this County Antrim woman underscores the significance of adequate support for cancer patients and survivors looking to transition back into their professional lives. Employers, co-workers, and the community as a whole should collectively contribute to nurturing an environment that empowers resilience in the face of adversity. 1. Understanding and Accommodating Employers: Employers play a crucial role in fostering a supportive environment for cancer patients returning to the workforce. By ensuring flexibility in working hours, accommodating remote work options, and providing extended sick leaves, they can help alleviate the physical and emotional burden on the recovering employee. 2. Co-worker Sensitivity and Encouragement: The role of empathetic and supportive colleagues cannot be overstated. By offering understanding encouragement, co-workers can ease the transition process for the returning employee. Additionally, fostering a judgment-free atmosphere will reduce stress and anxiety for the cancer patient. 3. Access to Professional Counseling and Rehabilitation Services: To create a seamless integration into the workforce, cancer patients may require assistance with career planning and job search. Professional counselors and vocational rehabilitation specialists can provide guidance on transitioning back into the workplace, setting achievable goals, and finding suitable job opportunities. 4. Legal Safeguards Against Discrimination: Appropriate legislation must be in place to safeguard cancer patients from discrimination within the workplace. Comprehensive anti-discrimination laws can protect the interests of employees looking to return to work after a diagnosis, ensuring that they are not denied rightful opportunities because of their medical condition. 5. Building a Supportive Community Network: Local support groups and community networks can provide the necessary emotional and practical assistance that cancer patients require when returning to the workforce. By closely collaborating with healthcare professionals, these groups can offer vital resources and practical information to help cancer patients navigate the complexities of their professional lives. Conclusion The exemplary courage of this County Antrim woman is a testament to the extraordinary strength that lies within each cancer patient. It serves as a call to action, urging society to rally behind these brave individuals and provide them with the support they need to resume and excel in their professional lives. By acknowledging their resilience and fostering a nurturing environment, both employers and the community can help transform the narrative of cancer, granting patients, survivors, and their families the power to redefine their lives on their terms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a rematch of a bitter 2005 loss for the Giants, when kicker Jay Feely missed three game-winning field goal attempts at the end of regulation and overtime in a 24-21 loss, the Seahawks made sure this game wouldn't be as close. After trading interceptions, with Corey Webster picking Matt Hasselbeck and Ken Hamlin intercepting Manning, the Seahawks jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 2-yard touchdown run by Shaun Alexander. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Nate Burleson. Manning would be intercepted again by Hamlin on the ensuing drive, leading to a 4-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson, and in eleven minutes, Seattle had a 21-0 lead. Manning had the ball on his own 43 with 10:43 left in the half when he threw his third pick of the game, this time to Michael Boulware. The Seahawks converted, going on a 12-play, 63-yard drive, capped off by a ten-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Will Heller. The game got worse for the Giants, as Plaxico Burress fumbled following a reception, with Leroy Hill recovering for Seattle. Hasselbeck then threw his fourth touchdown pass of the first half, this one going 21 yards to Bobby Engram. The Giants finally got on the board with a 46-yard field goal by Jay Feely as time expired. Seattle pushed the lead to 42-3 in the third quarter with a 17-play, 70-yard drive that ate up 9:58, capped by a 12-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Jackson. The Giants' offense, dormant all game, finally sprang to life in the fourth quarter. Manning found Amani Toomer on a 13-yard touchdown strike. After Fred Robbins intercepted Hasselbeck, Manning wasted no time finding Tim Carter on a 25-yard touchdown pass. When R.W. McQuarters intercepted Hasselbeck for a 27-yard touchdown return, the once-enormous Seattle lead was suddenly cut to 42-24, with 9:30 to play. The Giants would inch even closer after forcing a punt, and Manning found David Tyree on a 9-yard touchdown pass, cutting the lead down to 42-30.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"While the questions \\"How can I speak English fluently?\\" and \\"How can I be a native English speaker?\\" are related with their emphasis on English language proficiency, they don't hold exactly the same meaning. The question \\"How can I speak English fluently?\\" is about gaining a high level of proficiency in the English language. It is about the ability to communicate smoothly and effortlessly without any struggles or breaks in conversation. Many non-native English speakers aim for this kind of fluency to be able to interact, study, or work in English-speaking environments comfortably. On the other hand, the question \\"How can I be a native English speaker?\\" refers quite literally to someone who has grown up speaking English, typically learning it from their parents and community from a young age. It's important to note that native level proficiency in a language is not just about grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation but also understanding the nuances, idioms, metaphors, cultural practices, and contextual cues of the language. Here are some steps to help you speak English fluently: 1. **Regular Practice**: Practicing regularly is the key to mastering any language. The more you practice, the more fluent you'll become. This practice could involve speaking English with friends or colleagues, attending language classes, and incorporating it into your daily life. 2. **Expand Vocabulary**: Vocabulary is the building block of a language. The more words you know, the more articulate and fluent you can be. Consider having a dedicated vocabulary learning routine, which might involve flashcards, vocabulary apps, and reading in English. 3. **Improve Pronunciation**: Understand the correct pronunciation of words. This will not only increase your confidence but also improve your comprehension skills. Listening to English songs, podcasts, and watching movies or series can be helpful. 4. **Reading and Listening Skills**: Reading English newspapers, magazines, books, or online articles can help you gain a better understanding of sentence structures and grammar usage. Similarly, listening to English podcasts, news, and songs can improve your listening abilities and pronunciation. 5. **Grammar**: While speaking fluently involves more than just proper grammar, good grammar is still a cornerstone of effective communication. Study grammar and use resources to understand how sentences are correctly constructed in English. 6. **Conversation Practice**: Try to find a conversation partner with whom to practice. This can be a local meet-up group, a language exchange partner online, or even a paid tutor. The key is to practice speaking in real conversation scenarios. 7. **Think in English**: This might sound hard, but it's doable with practice. When you start thinking in English, you'll stop translating between your native language and English which will make your spoken English more fluent. However, becoming a native English speaker as a foreigner is technically impossible because native speakers are persons who learned the language as their first language in childhood. Yet, you could aim for the proficiency level of a native English speaker by embracing the culture, idioms, phrases, slang, pronunciation peculiar to native English speakers. It's important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways, so it might take some experimenting to find the best route for you. And while perfect fluency might seem like the ultimate goal, it's also important to enjoy the learning process itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious to know of life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes. Nemo explains that before birth, children remember everything that will happen in their lives. At the moment of conception, the Angels of Oblivion erase their memory. The Angels, however, forget about Nemo, allowing him to \\"remember\\" different possible futures for himself.

Dam Good Luck: From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers. The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night).

There are several reasons why displaying a flower in a vase on a table is the most suitable choice among the given options. 1. Aesthetics: Placing a flower in a vase on a table enhances the overall visual appeal of the space. The combination of a beautiful flower and an elegant vase can add charm and elegance to the table setting. Additionally, the flower can act as a centerpiece or focal point, drawing attention and sparking conversation among guests. 2. Functionality: A vase specifically designed to hold flowers effectively showcases the flower's beauty while also ensuring it receives proper hydration for optimal longevity. Vases are available in various shapes, sizes, and materials, allowing you to choose one that complements the specific flower you want to display as well as the overall decor of the room. 3. Versatility: A flower arrangement in a vase can be easily moved and repositioned on a table or from one table to another as needed. This makes it easy to maintain or change the aesthetics of the space without any interruption. 4. Suitability: Compared to the other options, a vase on a table is the most appropriate place to display a flower. Shelves (Option B) can be an alternative but may not be as visible or suitable for displaying single flowers. Parks (Option C) and gardens (Option D) are outdoor areas where flowers are usually planted, not displayed on a table. A windowsill (Option E) is another possible location, but it might not be as practical or effective for showcasing a flower, especially in a central location where people can appreciate its beauty. In summary, a vase on a table is the most suitable option for displaying a flower, as it offers the perfect combination of aesthetics, functionality, and versatility. By selecting a vase that complements your chosen flower and table setting, you can create a visually appealing and harmonious atmosphere in any indoor space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 0 * v - 28 = -7 * v 1. First, let's see what 0 times v (0 * v) is. No matter what number v is (big or small!), when we multiply it by 0, we always get 0. So, 0 * v = 0. Now our equation looks like this: 0 - 28 = -7 * v 2. Next, we can rewrite the equation as: -28 = -7 * v 3. Our goal is to find the value of v. To do that, we need to get v all by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, v is being multiplied by -7. Let's do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing, to cancel out the -7. 4. So, we will divide both sides of the equation by -7. Here's what it looks like: -28 / -7 = (-7 * v) / -7 5. Do the math on both sides of the equation: -28 divided by -7 is 4, so we get 4 = v Yay!

Write a summary based on this article: An email from a concerned friend of a suicidal student in Verona, Italy, mistakenly went to a police department of the same name in New Jersey, but authorities said it helped save a life. Mitchell Stern, police chief in Verona, New Jersey, said the department received an email April 14 from a Chinese student in the United Kingdom concerned about another Chinese student at the Verona Academy of Fine Arts in Italy. After trying to find contact information for the Italian police department of the same name and the Italian embassy, he eventually got in touch with Interpol, a network of police forces around the world. Interpol forwarded it to the state police in Italy. The student was found with her wrists partially slit and with a half-empty bottle of antidepressants when local police arrived at her apartment, the Italian Interior Ministry said in a statement. The student had told her friend in an online chat that she was going to harm herself, Stern said. \\"It really makes you step back and think you can help to save a life half a world away,\\" Stern said. Stern said the 30-member Verona, New Jersey, police department occasionally gets emails looking for lost luggage or reporting thefts in Verona, Italy, but nothing at the same magnitude as last Thursday's. Stern said he wouldn't have shared the story, but Italian authorities saw it as an opportunity to show how police work together. ||||| A police department in Verona, New Jersey, helped save the life of a Chinese student who attempted suicide more than 4,000 miles away in Verona, Italy, police told BuzzFeed News Monday. A police department in Verona, New Jersey, helped save the life of a Chinese student who attempted suicide more than 4,000 miles away in Verona, Italy, police told BuzzFeed News Monday. Mitchell Stern, the police chief of the Verona police department in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News that on Thursday, he received an email from a Chinese student in the U.K. that said another Chinese student in Verona, Italy, had threatened to kill herself on a group chat. The email said that the girl had \\"serious depression\\" and was going to harm herself, according to Stern, who refused to reveal the identities of both students. The student in the U.K. mistakenly sent the email on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. ET to Stern's department in New Jersey instead of the Italian police in Verona. The email address is not monitored 24/7, Stern said. When he saw the email at 5:20 p.m. ET, Stern immediately googled the Verona Police in Italy, but was unable to find their website. He then called the Italian embassy, but it was closed. Stern finally contacted Interpol in Washington, D.C., and forwarded the email to them, who, in turn, alerted the state police in Rome. At 7:10 p.m. ET, the student in the U.K. emailed Stern informing him that police were in the girl's apartment in Verona. In a Facebook post, the Italian state police, who identified the girl as a student of the Academy of Fine Arts of Verona, said she was found alive with her wrists partially severed and a half-empty bottle of antidepressants beside her. She was transported to the hospital and was stable, Stern said. ||||| VERONA, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) — A New Jersey police chief was looking back Thursday on his efforts to save a suicidal woman thousands of miles away in Italy. As CBS2’s Meg Baker reported, the woman he saved gave thanks in an email several days later. An email form a concerned friend of the woman in Verona, Italy, mistakenly ended up in the inbox for the police department in Verona, New Jersey. But that did not stop Chief of Police Mitchell Stern. Stern said the department received the email on Thursday, April 14 from a Chinese student in the United Kingdom. He was concerned about another Chinese student at the Verona Academy of Fine Arts in Italy. “He was conversing on a chat app — a messaging app — with another Chinese student, female, in Verona — and that she was in process of possibly committing suicide,” Stern said. Stern figured out that the friend was trying to contact the police department in Verona, Italy, and not the department for his Essex County, New Jersey township. But he still stepped into action, knowing that time was of the essence. He could not get through to the Verona, Italy police department, so he tried the Italian embassy in New York. It was after hours, so Stern then called New Jersey State Police and was able to find a contact at Interpol in Washington, D.C. That contact in turn sent the desperate message to Interpol in Italy. “Ultimately, the Italian state police responded to assist this young woman,” Stern said. “She had taken some pills and she had attempted to hurt herself physical. They transported her to hospital.” On Tuesday, the woman – who survived thanks to the chief’s relentless calls for help – wrote him an email. Stern read it out loud to CBS2’s Baker. “I am the girl from China who got saved by you, now in Verona, Italy,” the email read. “Though we don’t know each other before, you did really help me a lot. I believe there is millions of people like you. The lucky thing is that I have a chance to write this letter to you and say thank you. No wonder I begin to enjoy everything around me. Life is brilliant.” All Verona, New Jersey officers get special training to deal with delicate circumstances such as the ones Stern encountered. “We go to multiple in service classes to familiarize ourselves with situations like this, and he did a good job remembering his training,” said Verona police Officer Brendan Huber.

The network moved FYI to a new studio with a trendy exterior \`\`Window on America''. A significant story-arc saw the network squelch an FYI exposé on the tobacco industry, leading to the resignation of first Dial, then the remainder of the cast. They all went to work reorganizing the poorly-performing news division of a fledgling network. In the end, Miles faced down the network; the \`\`suits'' relented, the staffers returned and the story aired.

A:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the body is exposed to disease and reacts less efficiently, it can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects: - Reduced immune system response may lead to slower and less efficient elimination of bacteria, which could result in a prolonged infection or more serious illness. - The decreased response may not produce enough antibodies or immune cells to combat the bacteria, allowing them to multiply and spread more rapidly. Indirect effects: - When the immune system is not functioning optimally, the body's ability to repair damaged tissues and restore normal function may be impaired, causing longer recovery times and potentially leading to complications. - The individual may be more susceptible to secondary infections or other health issues due to a weakened immune system.

Sentiment analysis is a way of determining the emotional or subjective meaning behind a piece of text, such as a tweet, typically by identifying whether it is positive, negative, or neutral in nature. In this particular tweet, the dominant phrase is \\"Doesn't feel good.\\" The use of the word \\"doesn't\\" immediately suggests a negative sentiment, as it indicates a lack of something. In this case, the lack is related to feeling good, further reinforcing the negative sentiment. Moreover, adding the phrase \\"at all\\" emphasizes the sentiment, suggesting a strong sense of negativity or dissatisfaction. Considering the phrasing and words used in this tweet, the sentiment can be confidently categorized as: [A]. negative. Even without any additional context, the negative emotion is evident in the language and tone of this tweet. However, it is important to remember that sentiment analysis is not infallible, and understanding the context in which the tweet was written can sometimes give different insights.

Then the statement mentions that Ashoka went to Ujjain and he got injured in a battle. At that time, Devi, a daughter of a merchant from Vidisha, married Ashoka. Bindusara did not approve of this marriage as she was a Buddhist. Finally, Bindusara asked Ashoka to stay in Pataliputra and made him the ruler of Ujjain.

Reporting the phishing email: To help in the fight against phishing scams, Cameron might want to report the situation to the Anti-Phishing Working Group via email at reportphishing@apwg.org. 2. Forwarding the phishing email: If the email was designed to mimic a specific company, Cameron should forward the email to that company. Many businesses have a security team dedicated to tracking and preventing phishing attempts. 3. Ensuring his computer security is up to date: Regular updates to his computer's security software will provide added protection against potential threats. 4. Changing his passwords: If Cameron suspects his personal information may have been compromised, he should change his passwords immediately. 5. Monitoring his accounts: Whether or not he has fallen prey to the scam, Cameron should monitor his financial and personal accounts closely for any irregular activity. 6. Be careful about what information he shares online: Scammers often get information from publicly accessible details on the internet. It is recommended to limit the amount of personal information shared on social media platforms and other websites. Remember, under no circumstances should he engage directly with the scammers, as this could potentially escalate the situation and put him at further risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Hollow Man 2 Context: At a plush cocktail party at Reisner Institute, a government think tank based in Redmond, Washington DC, the guests and scientists present are enjoying themselves. One such scientist, Dylan, suddenly begins to become manipulated by an invisible force, which creates a scene to the guests and drags the scientist into the nearby bathroom and proceeds to brutally beat and throw Dylan around the room. Dylan apparently knows who it is, and begs the invisible man not to kill him, as he \\"doesn't have it\\", but the invisible man persists as he's \\"getting worse\\" and he's \\"running out of time\\". Though he does not know how to make more, Dylan mentions that another scientist, Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan), knows the formula. Seemingly accepting this, the invisible man releases Dylan and tells him not to tell anyone he was here, to which he agrees. No sooner has he left, than Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man, who only pretended to leave to see if Dylan would stay silent, smashes the phone on the ground, and slashes Dylan's neck with the broken circuit board, killing him.The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct an investigation, but the military supervisor of the laboratory, Colonel Gavin Bishop (William MacDonald), insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction over the crime, and refuses to relent even when one of the detectives, Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli), points out that they have no experience conducting a proper criminal investigation.Fearing another attack on the remaining scientists, the lab company owner, Dr. William Reisner (David McIlwraith), employs Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez (Sarah Deakins), to protect Maggie (despite the military forcing the police out of the investigation), but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work they are doing, which includes refusing to tell them that an invisible killer is on the loose.Turner and Lisa, after gaining Maggie's reluctant cooperation,...

The Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers said the Welsh government consortium which buys their services is looking to renegotiate their contracts. Philip Sutton from the NAFP said he was concerned councils, through the consortium, were looking to cut costs. The Welsh government said it works with councils to improve foster care. The NAFP represents independent foster carers, who provide just under 40% of placements in Wales. Mr Sutton said he was worried children \\"would not thrive in the way we have expected them to\\" because of the cuts. \\"My main worry is that local authorities, through the consortium, are looking to reduce the cost of placements by reducing the additional services that agencies provide: things like education services and respite services,\\" he said. \\"They are looking for a basic care provision.\\" Mr Sutton said he was also concerned that the changes might see children move frequently between placements as foster carers struggled to cope. \\"One of the things we always look for in foster caring, which is proved to provide the best possible outcomes, is stability,\\" he said. \\"You need some kind of help for carers with difficult placements to achieve that. \\"If foster carers are not able to access therapy or other services it can make the difference between a placement continuing or breaking down. \\"The worry is if we're reducing the availability of therapy and other provisions more placements will break down and it's been shown clearly that children who have multiple placements don't do well in life generally.\\" 'Emotive issue' Among other changes Mr Sutton said are being proposed are plans to cut the mileage allowance that foster carers can claim for trips, such as hospital appointments. He described this as an \\"emotive\\" issue and something that some providers might find difficult to continue.

If you invite a police without a warrant to come into your house and he finds proof of crime, the evidence may be used against you in court. If you do not want an officer to search you or your home and he does not have a warrant, tell him that you do not give him the right to search. However, if the officer will not listen, do not try to stop him. It is dangerous to resist and it may be illegal to do so.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them.

We don't want paint dripping. - Hold the brush like a pencil, close to the bristles. - Make a smooth line along the edge where the wall meets the ceiling, floor, or other wall. - Move slowly and carefully, so you don't get paint where you don't want it. 2. Second method (with painter's tape): - Find some painter's tape, it's usually blue or green and helps keep paint off areas you don't want to paint. - Put the tape on the edge of the wall, right next to the area you want to paint. - Press the tape firmly, so paint can't get under it. - Now you can use the paint brush like in the first method. - When you're done painting, wait for the paint to dry, and then carefully take off the tape.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

What is the answer to this question? what is the general name of the implement used to strike the ball in golf?","completion":"The general name of the implement used to strike the ball in golf is called a golf club. Golf clubs are designed in a variety of shapes and sizes, catering to different types of shots and player preferences. They are an essential part of the game, enabling golfers to propel the golf ball towards the hole with precision and accuracy. A standard set of golf clubs consists of 14 clubs, each serving a specific purpose on the golf course. They are broadly classified into four main categories, namely woods, irons, wedges, and putters. Here is a detailed explanation of each type of club: 1. Woods: These clubs are designed for hitting the ball over long distances, such as during tee shots on longer holes. Traditionally, they were made from hardwood, like persimmon, but modern woods are commonly constructed from various metals like titanium, steel, and other composite materials. The most well-known wood is the driver (also known as 1-wood), which has the largest clubhead and the least loft among woods, generating the maximum speed and distance. 2. Irons: Irons are typically used for shots of varying lengths, from the tee box on shorter holes to an approach shot from the fairway to reach the green. These clubs have smaller, more compact, angled clubheads, and are typically numbered between 2-9, with the loft angle increasing from 2-iron, which has the least loft, to 9-iron, having the highest loft. Long irons (2, 3, and 4) are suitable for longer approach shots, mid irons (5, 6, and 7) are versatile and used for a broad range of shots, while short irons (8 and 9) are designed for higher, shorter shots offering more control and precision. 3. Wedges: Wedges are a subset of irons that serve a specialized purpose. They are designed for short distance shots, typically to escape challenging situations, such as bunkers, or to achieve greater accuracy and control when approaching the green. Wedges have the highest loft angle among golf clubs, allowing the ball to be lifted quickly and land softly on the green. The common types of wedges include the pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge, and lob wedge, each providing different loft and bounce characteristics. 4. Putters: The putter is the most specialized golf club in a player's arsenal, used exclusively on or around the greens to finish the hole by rolling the golf ball into the cup. Putters come in various designs, including blade (or traditional) putters, mallet putters, and alignment-style putters, each offering different levels of balance, stability, and alignment aid to suit individual player preferences. The critical aspect of selecting a putter is finding a design that allows the golfer to feel comfortable and confident while addressing the ball and executing the putt. Customization and fitting are important factors in selecting golf clubs. Each golfer has unique swing characteristics and abilities, making it essential to choose clubs that best suit individual needs and styles. Factors such as clubhead design, shaft flex, length, lie angle, and grip can significantly influence a player's performance on the course and should be carefully considered while selecting the appropriate golf clubs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're an adult, contact your doctor or hospital about the procedures necessary to effectively prepare for the operation. Undergo the surgery if you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing.; 3. Make sure that you have a recommended amount of travel time before surgery. Refer to your doctor about any medical conditions that might make doing this an inpatient treatment option.; 4. Determine what you plan to eat at the surgery. Many doctors will tell you to eat breakfast in advance, and other types of food may be absolutely necessary, such as pancakes or oatmeal with butter or some fillings.; Answer:","completion":"1. Ask your doctor questions you have in regards to your herniated disk surgery and fully research the procedure. There are three common types of herniated disc surgery: laminectomy, corpectomy, and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The correct answer is option 1 because it explains the importance of asking your doctor questions and researching the procedure for herniated disk surgery. Understanding the common types of surgeries and discussing these options with your doctor can help you make an informed decision. Option 2 is incorrect because it focuses on chest pain and difficulty breathing, which are not directly related to herniated disk surgery preparation. These symptoms may be a separate issue that needs medical attention, but they don't provide guidance on preparing for a herniated disk surgery. Option 3 is also incorrect because it concentrates on travel time and inpatient treatment options, which are not central to the main topic of herniated disk surgery preparation. While travel time and inpatient treatment may be relevant factors, they are not directly related to understanding and preparing for the surgical procedure. Option 4 is incorrect because it discusses the kind of food you should eat before surgery.

But now, ITV is hoping to recapture the weekend buzz by launching a new breakfast show. Scrambled! - which will start at 7.30am on Saturdays and Sundays - is due to be aired late January. Popular: Tiswas, featuring Chris Tarrant, became a cult favourite when it hit ITV's airwaves in the 1970s Mayhem: The show proved popular with both children and adults across the UK, before it was axed in 1982 Despite being axed in 1982, it spawned a variety of OPTIONS: - Ant and Dec-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - Chris Tarrant-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - ITV-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - PUBLISHED-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - SMTV Live-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - Sophie Jane Evans-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - Tiswas-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - UK-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. - UPDATED-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box.","completion":"Despite being axed in 1982, it spawned a variety of Tiswas-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box. The show touched the hearts of many viewers and became synonymous with childhood memories for those who grew up watching it. Now, with the imminent launch of Scrambled!, ITV aims to bring back the charm and excitement that Saturday morning children's television once held. The new show will feature a mix of cartoons, live-action series, and interactive segments to engage viewers and give them a reason to wake up early on the weekends. The producers of Scrambled! have been studying the formula that made shows like Tiswas and Ant and Dec's SMTV Live successful, aiming to create content that will not only entertain and engage children but also appeal to the whole family - giving parents a reason to join their kids in front of the television. Taking lessons from the past, Scrambled! will showcase a talented and diverse cast of presenters who can expertly juggle humor, enthusiasm, and age-appropriate content. The emphasis will be on creating an environment where kids feel involved and encouraged to participate in on-air games and discussions, replicating the magic of previous shows that used audience interaction as a key part of their success. Furthermore, Scrambled! aspires to cultivate a loyal fanbase as Tiswas did in the past, potentially leading to its own line of merchandise, fan clubs, and social media communities where viewers can continue the conversation beyond the show itself. Only time will tell if Scrambled! will rise to the challenge and achieve a similar level of success, nostalgia, and admiration as its iconic predecessors. But, what is clear is that ITV is determined to recreate the once-cherished weekend morning ritual, offering children and their families a vibrant and entertaining alternative for the start of their day."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Jose Antonio Aguilar (born August 7, 1968), better known as Pepe Aguilar is an American singer-songwriter and actor.

Please answer the following question: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier. Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Answer:","completion":"To determine which country club Jack would enjoy playing golf at more, let's compare the grass heights at the two clubs. Aurora Country Club: - Grass height: 2 1/2 inches Augusta Country Club: - Grass height: 4 inches Since Jack prefers to play on turf where the ball rolls easier, he would enjoy playing at the country club with shorter grass. In this case, the Aurora Country Club has shorter grass at 2 1/2 inches compared to the Augusta Country Club's 4 inches.

Movie title: Boarding Gate Context: Paris[edit] After discussing his plans for retiring by selling on the shares in his security company to his debtors with his partner, AndrÃ©, aging underworld entrepreneur Miles Rennberg is paid a surprise visit at his Paris office by aggressive underworld moll Sandra. Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earlier queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car. He sends Lisa away on his motorcycle and takes her place in the car. After Sandra emerges, Lester drives her away from the scene. Expressing disappointment in her deceit, he takes her back to her apartment where it becomes clear that the two are romantically involved. After their sexual encounter, Lester receives a call from his wife and leaves. Sandra appears to relent and arranges to visit Miles at his apartment.

Step 2: Establish the Setting - The story takes place in a world where time and space are unstable, switching between the different realms of realities. The real world, the afterlife, and the state of limbo are all interconnected through a vortex. Step 3: Create the Plot Act 1: Setup - Jerry wakes up in a strange and unfamiliar world, disoriented and unable to remember how he got there. - He meets Alyssa, who claims she has been in limbo for quite some time. She explains the nature of the world they're trapped in and mentions that a powerful being named Gabriel is responsible. - Alyssa agrees to help Jerry find answers in hopes that they can find a way to escape together. Act 2: Confrontation - Jerry and Alyssa begin their quest, encountering odd characters and navigating through the unstable environment. - They meet Tom, who claims to know how to break free from the state of limbo. Tom stays with Jerry and Alyssa on their journey. - The trio discovers a desolate city, which holds the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Gabriel and the limbo state. - They learn that Gabriel is a supernatural being responsible for maintaining the balance of life and death by placing some people in limbo as \\"placeholders.\\" - Tom suggests stealing a sacred artifact belonging to Gabriel to force him into releasing them. Act 3: Resolution - The trio successfully steals the artifact, but in doing so, they enrage Gabriel and unleash his wrath upon the limbo world. - The world starts falling apart, with the boundaries between the realms becoming more unstable. - Tom betrays Jerry and Alyssa, revealing his true intentions and allegiance to Gabriel the whole time. - Jerry confronts Gabriel, argues about the unfairness of being a pawn in the balance of life and death, and pleads for his release. - Gabriel, acknowledging Jerry's determination and pure heart, grants him the chance to return to the real world, but only if he can pass a final test – a trial that will reveal his inner strength and willingness to sacrifice for others. - Jerry overcomes the test, thus freeing him and Alyssa from the state of limbo. They return to the real world but with the knowledge of the supernatural world that exists to maintain balance. The story concludes with Jerry and Alyssa learning life lessons from their journey through limbo, valuing the people around them, and making the most of their second chance at life. The existence of Gabriel and the state of limbo serves as a reminder of the eternal balance of life and death and their role as pawns in that balance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasing problem. Rapid detection of MRSA-colonized patients has the potential to limit spread of the organism. We evaluated the sensitivities and specificities of MRSA detection by two molecular methods (IDI-MRSA PCR assay and GenoType MRSA Direct PCR assay) and three selective MRSA agars (MRSA ID, MRSASelect, and CHROMagar MRSA), using 205 (101 nasal, 52 groin, and 52 axillary samples) samples from consecutive known MRSA-infected and/or -colonized patients. All detection methods had higher MRSA detection rates for nasal swabs than for axillary and groin swabs. Detection of MRSA by IDI-MRSA was the most sensitive method, independent of the site (94% for nasal samples, 80% for nonnasal samples, and 90% overall). The sensitivities of the GenoType MRSA Direct assay and the MRSA ID, MRSASelect, and CHROMagar MRSA agars with nasal swabs were 70%, 72%, 68%, and 75%, respectively. All detection methods had high specificities (95 to 99%), independent of the swab site. Extended incubation for a further 24 h with selective MRSA agars increased the detection of MRSA, with a corresponding decline in specificity secondary to a significant increase in false-positive results. There was a noticeable difference in test performance of the GenoType MRSA Direct assay in detection of MRSA (28/38 samples [74%]) compared with detection of nonmultiresistant MRSA (17/31 samples [55%]) (susceptible to two or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). This was not observed with selective MRSA agar plates or IDI-MRSA. Although it is more expensive, in addition to rapid turnaround times of 2 to 4 h, IDI-MRSA offers greater detection of MRSA colonization, independent of the swab site, than do conventional selective agars and GenoType MRSA Direct.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

The information given in the context does not mention anything about the race, ethnicity, or cultural background of the residents in the area. However, let us analyze the context in greater detail to determine why we cannot infer the hypothesis stated. The context provides us with geographical information about North Wingfield, indicating that it is a large village and civil parish in the English county of Derbyshire. We also learn about its proximity to other towns, such as Chesterfield and Clay Cross, and that it is part of the North East Derbyshire district. Additionally, the context highlights the prominent roads running through the village, such as the A6175 road connecting the M1 motorway and the A61 road. The only demographic information offered is the total population of North Wingfield, which according to the 2011 census, was 6,505. No specific details about the race, ethnicity, or cultural background of the population are provided. Considering North Wingfield is situated in England, making any assumptions about its population's racial composition would be speculative without solid data. It is important to note that England is a predominantly Caucasian country, with the majority of residents being of White British origin. According to the 2011 census data, approximately 86% of the population in England and Wales identified as White British. However, this does not provide enough evidence to assume the same is true for North Wingfield. In conclusion, the context provided is insufficient to draw the hypothesis that North Wingfield has a population of predominately African-Americans. Additional demographic data is needed to make any assertions about the racial or ethnic makeup of the population in North Wingfield."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates. Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: \\"There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.\\" Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir--border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in office--Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials. On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) that the President would visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world. The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact. In February 1972, Nixon and his wife traveled to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation. Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva. Over 100 television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised. Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues. Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon, whom he considered forthright, unlike the leftists and the Soviets. He said he was suspicious of Kissinger, though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his \\"encounter with history\\". A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People. The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China, and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification. When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City, Ming Tombs, and the Great Wall. Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals. The visit ushered in a new era of Sino-American relations. Fearing the possibility of a Sino-American alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for detente with the United States.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).","completion":"This text is about Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a Turkish politician who is currently the President of Turkey.

Context: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

The Washington Post reported that one was found drunk and passed out in the hallway of an Amsterdam hotel. A Secret Service spokesman declined to give details but said the three had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. The service has been trying to rebuild its reputation after previous scandals. In 2013 two agents were removed from President Obama's security detail amid allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. And in 2012 several agents were dismissed following allegations that they hired prostitutes while in Cartagena, Colombia. President 'safe' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said the latest incident happened before President Obama's arrival in the Netherlands on Monday for a nuclear security summit. He said the three had been sent home for \\"disciplinary reasons\\" but declined to elaborate. Mr Donovan added that the president's security had not been compromised in any way. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Secret Service agents prepare the way for Mr Obama's trips abroad and are part of his entourage The Washington Post reported that all three were on the Counter Assault Team - which protects the president - and that one agent was a team leader. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the incident, the newspaper said that one agent was found drunk and unconscious by hotel staff, who reported it to the US embassy. It is believed that the other two agents were deemed complicit because they did not intervene. On Wednesday, senior US senators on the Senate homeland security committee, which oversees the Secret Service, expressed concern about the incident. Senator Tom Carper, chairman of the committee and a Democrat, said he had asked the agency for more information about the matter. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said the incident \\"shows that the agency has to deal with some in its ranks who fail to respect the important job the agency is tasked with\\". He said newly appointed Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has \\"got work to do to regain the trust of the American people\\". President Obama visited the Netherlands on the first leg of a weeklong, four-country trip. He departed for Brussels on Tuesday night. The elite security force has been attempting to rebuild its reputation following the prostitution scandal revealed in April 2012. A number of agents were dismissed after claims that they hired prostitutes in Cartagena while preparing the way for Mr Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas. Following the scandal, the agency put new procedures in place and officials pledged to curb its perceived male-dominated hard partying culture. Last year, Mr Obama named Ms Pierson, a veteran agent, as the Secret Service's first female director. And in December 2013, an inspector general's report concluded that there was no evidence of widespread misconduct within the Secret Service. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Three US Secret Service agents who were supposed to protect President Barack Obama during his visit to the Netherlands were sent home for misbehaving.

However, one matter remains unambiguous - the Seau family does not hold the National Football League (NFL) responsible for the unfortunate demise of their beloved family member. Despite several reports and speculations surrounding the tragic circumstances of his death in May 2012, Seau's family asserts that they do not point fingers at the NFL organization. A Promising Career Overshadowed by Tragedy Born on January 19, 1969, Tiaina Baul Seau Jr., better known as Junior Seau, was an American professional football player with a prolific career spanning two decades. Throughout his NFL tenure, he enjoyed multiple honors and accolades that resulted from his dedication to the sport. As a linebacker, Seau was a tenacious player who put his all into every game. Ultimately, his career was tarnished by tragedy when Seau committed suicide at the age of 43. The shockwave sent ripples throughout the media, football enthusiasts, and his family. Discussions erupted about possible links between his profession and the circumstances leading up to his death. Many have pondered whether the constant physical strain and the lingering effects of multiple injuries could have contributed to his choice to take his own life. The Seau Family's Stance Although several investigations have shown that brain damage resulting from multiple concussions can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a degenerative brain disease, the Seau family chooses not to hold the NFL responsible. The family understands that football is an intense, physically demanding sport, and they acknowledge the risks associated with it. They believe that holding the NFL accountable would not bring any solace or do justice to Junior's memory. Contrary to numerous reports suggesting that the Seau family blames the NFL for his death, they emphasize that they have no intention of dragging the league's name through the mud. They neither blame nor fault the organization, but rather wish to uphold their loved one's legacy with pride, respect, and dignity. They understand the severity and complexity of the situation and the need to focus on the essential aspects of mental health and well-being in athletes. Promoting Awareness and Support for Struggling Athletes Instead of pointing fingers at the NFL, the Seau family concentrates on raising awareness of the importance of mental health and supporting athletes who face similar struggles. They encourage the sports community to take proactive steps in ensuring players' well-being, both physically and mentally, to prevent any future tragic outcomes. The family also founded the Junior Seau Foundation to honor his memory and support programs that inspire young people to embrace education and sports as a way to improve their lives and communities. This foundation works towards making a positive impact on the lives of the people it serves, ensuring that Junior's legacy of generosity and commitment to others remains intact. Conclusion The Junior Seau family maintains a firm stance in asserting that they do not blame the NFL for the death of their beloved family member. They wish to use the tragedy of his passing as a catalyst for change and to drive awareness about the importance of mental health in athletes. By focusing on the positive aspects of Junior Seau's life and channeling their energies into helping others, the Seau family honors his memory, his generosity, and his unwavering commitment to others, ensuring that his legend lives on not in blame, but in inspiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: train station, house, cupboard, cricket stadium, surface of earth Why is \\"house\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"House\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because a house is typically a private residential space occupied by a limited number of people, such as a family or individuals living together. As such, the air inside a house is likely to have been breathed by only the residents and a few recent visitors, unlike public spaces like train stations and cricket stadiums, where a large number of people tend to gather, or open spaces like the surface of earth, where air is constantly being circulated and mixed. In contrast to the other possible answers, a cupboard is a confined and non-habitable space, which means people typically don't spend time inside it, breathing or otherwise. While the air within a cupboard might technically be considered \\"breathed by only a few people recently,\\" it doesn't align with the implicit context of the question, which is about spaces where people might actually spend time and breathe the air.

Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot.

Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

Premise: \\"In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command \\"Drink.\\" Tommy obeyed.\\" This premise provides us with several key pieces of information. Firstly, we learn that there is a German character who stepped forward and offered a glass to someone named Tommy. Secondly, the German briefly commands Tommy to drink, thus implying that the German has authority in the situation or is assertive in prompting Tommy to consume the beverage. Lastly, the most crucial point in the premise is that Tommy obeys the German's command and drinks from the glass. Hypothesis: \\"He refused their offer of a drink, despite his thirst.\\" This hypothesis presents a scenario where someone, presumably Tommy from the premise, is refusing an offer to drink even though he is thirsty. As we can see, the statement creates direct opposition to the events described in the premise. Now, let's evaluate the consistency between the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, Tommy obeys the German's command and drinks from the glass. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests that someone (most likely Tommy) refused an offer of a drink. If we assume that the premise is entirely accurate, we must conclude that the hypothesis does not hold true. The premise establishes that Tommy drinks from the glass, while the hypothesis implies that he refuses the offer of a drink. Given the information, the two scenarios cannot coexist, which means the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and instead contradicts it.

All three of these are either less or greater than an ecosystem. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point). - Martinique is an insular region of France located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of and a population of 385,551 inhabitants as of January 2013.

Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903. - Saint Lucia is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean.

Finn does, and the convict unexpectedly tries to make Finn take him by boat to Mexico. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy, and Finn's boat is towed back to shore. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict has been caught, and that he was Arthur Lustig, a former mobster and his sentence is the death penalty.Uncle Joe (Chris Cooper) gets called to Paradiso Perduto (\\"lost paradise\\"), home of the richest lady in Florida, Ms. Nora Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft).

For most of us, the only recycling this Christmas involved large piles of wrapping paper. But the BBC took things to a whole new level by re-using many of its biggest Christmas shows days – and in some cases, hours – after they first aired. Viewers were shocked to see shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Gruffalo’s Child, which aired on Christmas Day, reappear on BBC1 on Boxing Day. Repeat: The Gruffalo's Child, pictured, was aired on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day. The festive episode of Doctor Who was not far behind as viewers were hit with it for a second time, just two days after it premiered on December 25. The Christmas Eve episode of Winter Wipeout was on again on Boxing Day and another hotly anticipated Christmas Day show, Absolutely Fabulous, will be screened tonight. Even one of the biggest films was being given a second outing – The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe, which aired on BBC1 on Christmas Eve, is on BBC3 tomorrow night. Was this the worst Christmas ever on the BBC? ITV gave shows such as Michael Buble: Home For Christmas and The Jonathan Ross Show more than one showing, and the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey will be screened again on New Year’s Day. But viewers singled out the BBC for recycling so much of their new output over the festive period. As well as its big Christmas Day shows, the corporation also aired cookery shows The Hairy Bikers’ Christmas Party, Rick Stein’s Spanish Christmas and Lorraine’s Last Minute Christmas only 15 hours after their first slot. Viewers have also complained that this year’s festive line-up was one of the worst in recent memory. Shows such as the return of Absolutely Fabulous did not live up to many people’s expectations and the new Sir David Jason comedy was another disappointment. As well, the Downton Abbey special on Christmas Day did not get the huge ratings many were expecting. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message board: ‘What’s with all the repeats? On Boxing Day you repeated Strictly from Christmas Day, Winter Wipeout from Christmas Eve, not to mention the numerous repeats of the Morecambe and Wise Specials. ‘There is no need to repeat programmes now as most people have access to a digital recorder… can’t you spend the licence fee on some new programmes instead.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We never repeat prime-time shows in the same slot. ‘This Christmas has seen brand new shows in drama, factual, entertainment and religion. ‘Over 91 per cent of programming on peak-time on BBC1 is brand new and has never been shown before.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Answer a question about this article: To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve’s classification of CRA loans as “prime” is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal “subprime” loans.

He was a direct descendant of Jesse de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th Century due to religious persecution. De Forest's father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association's Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school \\"open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color\\", and which educated primarily African-Americans. One of de Forest's areas of research at Federal Telegraph was improving the reception of signals, and he came up with the idea of strengthening the audio frequency output from a grid Audion by feeding it into a second tube for additional amplification. He called this a \\"cascade amplifier\\", which eventually consisted of chaining together up to three Audions. At this time the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify telephone signals to provide better long-distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest's device had potential as a telephone line repeater. In mid-1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT&T to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest's \\"gassy\\" version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. (Due to the way he constructed the tubes, de Forest's Audions would cease to operate with too high a vacuum.) However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT&T's Western Electric subsidiary determined that by improving the tube's design, it could be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to successfully operate at telephone line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron-discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. (Dr. Irving Langmuir at the General Electric Corporation made similar findings, and both he and Arnold attempted to patent the \\"high vacuum\\" construction, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1931 that this modification could not be patented). After a delay of ten months, in July 1913 AT&T, through a third party who disguised his link to the telephone company, purchased the wire rights to seven Audion patents for 50,000. De Forest had hoped for a higher payment, but was again in bad financial shape and was unable to bargain for more. In 1915, AT&T used the innovation to conduct the first transcontinental telephone calls, in conjunction with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was his next attempt","completion":"Lee de Forest's next attempt was to improve the reception of signals.

Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said.

Add enough water to the juice to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid. Rough-chop the clams into small pieces and set aside. Canned clams can be used instead of fresh clams. You should still drain the liquid from these clams and reserve it for use in the chowder. Add enough water to the liquid to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid. Alternatively, add bottled clam juice to the reserved clam juice instead of water. Doing so will create a stronger clam flavor. Cook the bacon over medium heat for several minutes until it turns crisp and brown on both sides. If the saucepan is too small to place full strips of bacon in, cut the slices in halves or thirds before placing them in the pan. Note that bacon has enough fat in it to cook without the addition of extra oil. When the bacon has finished cooking, drain it on paper towels and crumble it into small pieces. Set aside until the end. Alternatively, you could use pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits instead of cooking your own bacon. Pour most of the bacon grease out of the saucepan, saving only 1 Tbsp (15 ml). If, for whatever reason, you do not have enough grease to leave 1 Tbsp (15 ml) in the pan, add enough olive oil or cooking oil to make up the difference. If using pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits, heat 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil or cooking oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour the reserved, diluted clam juice into the saucepan. Add the potatoes, onion, instant bouillon granules, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and dried thyme immediately afterward. You will need 3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped into small, bite-size pieces. This should make about 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) of potatoes. Chop 1 large onion, creating roughly 1 cup (250 ml) of chopped onion. Use chicken or vegetable bouillon granules. Do not use beef-flavored granules. Crush the thyme with your fingers before adding it. If using fresh thyme instead of dried, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) and chop the thyme well before adding it. Heat the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 15 minutes. Cover the pan as the chowder base simmers. The potatoes should be tender once finished. Press each potato against the side of the pan using the back of a fork. The potatoes should not be completely mashed, but they should be crushed or crumbled once finished. Note that this step can be skipped if you diced the potatoes into small enough chunks. In a separate dish, combine the milk, half-and-half, and flour until smooth. Stir this mixture into the saucepan until evenly blended. Once the flour mixture has been added to the chowder base, the contents of the saucepan should bubble and thicken. You can use whole milk or 2-percent milk. Similarly, you could use half-and-half or light cream. Stir the chopped or minced clams into the chowder. Let boil, then reduce the heat and cook for 2 additional minutes. Boiling and simmering the chowder after you add the clams will ensure that the clams are cooked without being overcooked. It also ensures that the entire dish will be heated through.

A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process after baking the cake in the oven for the required time would be to carefully remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool. To elaborate: 1. Safety First: Upon completion of the baking time, put on oven mitts or use a thick towel to protect your hands from the heat. Open the oven and, using both hands, gently remove the cake pan from the oven. 2. Testing Cake Doneness: Before entirely removing the cake from the oven, you can perform a quick test to ensure that it's fully baked. Take a toothpick or a small skewer and insert it into the center or thickest part of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached, the cake is done. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, then bake the cake for a few minutes longer and test again until it's fully baked. 3. Cooling the Cake: Place the cake pan on a wire rack or any heat-resistant and well-ventilated surface to cool. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes. Cooling the cake before removing it from the pan is essential, as it will help the cake set and reduce the chances of it breaking or sticking to the pan. 4. Removing the Cake from the Pan: After allowing the cake to cool for the recommended time, gently run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen any areas that may be sticking to the pan. If you're using a springform pan, release the sides of the pan. Carefully flip the cake pan upside down over a wire rack or flat plate, and tap it gently to help release the cake. If the cake doesn't release immediately, give it a few more minutes to cool before attempting again. 5. Final Cooling: Once the cake is out of the pan, let it cool on the wire rack or plate for another 1-2 hours until it reaches room temperature. Cooling the cake entirely is crucial, especially if you plan on frosting or decorating the cake, as warm cake will cause the frosting to melt or decorations to slide off. 6. Frosting and Decorating: Now that your cake is completely cooled, you can proceed with frosting and decorating as desired. Apply a layer of frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake using a spatula or a frosting knife. You can also use a piping bag and various piping tips to create intricate patterns and designs. 7. Serving and Storing: Once the cake is frosted and decorated, you can either serve it immediately or store it properly, depending on when you plan to serve it. For storing, cover the cake with a cake dome or a large container to protect it from air and dust. Depending on the type of cake and frosting, you may need to refrigerate the cake or store it at room temperature.

Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars).

Question: He enjoyed reading newspaper, he consider what a subscription? Options: - gifting - buying - money - literacy - knowing how to read Explain why a human would choose \\"buying\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"buying\\" In order to understand why a human would choose the option \\"buying\\" as the answer to the question above, let's analyze each of the given options in relation to the context provided. The context is about a person who enjoys reading newspapers and is considering getting a subscription. A newspaper subscription typically involves regularly receiving issues of a publication, usually on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This is a paid service that grants the subscriber access to valuable content and keeps them informed or entertained. Now let's break down and analyze each of the given options: 1. Gifting: This option refers to the act of giving something voluntarily, as a favor or as a present, without expecting anything in return. Although it's true that someone might gift a newspaper subscription to a person who enjoys reading newspapers, it's not directly related to the person considering a subscription for themselves. 2. Buying: This option implies the act of obtaining something in exchange for money, which is often the case with a newspaper subscription. By choosing this option, a person would show their willingness to invest money in order to gain access to regular issues of a publication they enjoy reading. 3. Money: While money is involved in getting a subscription, as you usually have to pay for the service, it doesn't directly convey the action of a person considering a subscription. It merely represents the medium used for exchange. 4. Literacy: Knowing how to read is a prerequisite to appreciating newspapers, but it doesn't directly relate to the act of a person considering a subscription. Literacy is simply the ability to read and write, not necessarily the willingness to subscribe to a publication. 5. Knowing how to read: Similar to literacy, knowing how to read is a necessary skill to enjoy reading newspapers. However, it does not directly express someone's intent to subscribe to the publication. In conclusion, among all the provided options, \\"buying\\" is the most appropriate and fitting answer to the question above. It captures the essence of the context by indicating the person's intention to invest money in obtaining regular access to their favorite newspaper through a subscription. The other options, while somewhat related, don't directly align with the core idea of the question. By choosing \\"buying,\\" a human correctly identifies the action most likely taken by someone who enjoys reading newspapers and is considering the idea of subscribing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: As compared to a pet store, the staff at an animal shelter or pet rescue tend to have deeper knowledge of rabbit care. Also, the rabbits often receive better care and socialization at shelters and rescues. By adopting from a shelter or rescue, you’ll also be providing a good home to a rabbit that needs one, rather than encouraging the breeding of additional rabbits to fill the cages at a pet store. Because the staff members at a shelter or rescue tend to be knowledgeable and eager to help, you can ask plenty of questions about the background and care needs of particular rabbits before making a decision. Rabbits at shelters or rescues might cost a little more initially, but they’re usually already de-sexed, vaccinated, de-wormed, and microchipped, which can save you money in the long run. Pet store rabbits usually come from mass-breeding operations, which tend to put profit over the health or happiness of the rabbits. Buying from pet stores only further encourages this practice. Pet store rabbits are often more prone to digestive issues, due to being fed an inadequate diet and being exposed to excessive stress. If you do go to a pet store, ask lots of questions about where the rabbits come from and the type of care they have received. If the staff can’t or won’t provide you with satisfactory answers, go elsewhere. Not all breeders provide the same level of care or have the same degree of knowledge about the rabbits they raise. If you want to buy from a breeder, take the time to find one who is knowledgeable about rabbits and provides proper care for them. Talk to friends with rabbits and local veterinarians to get recommendations on reputable breeders in your area. Always visit the breeding facility before buying. Look around and make sure it is clean and that the rabbits look well-fed and cared for. Ask the breeder or rescue staff lots of questions about the care they provide for their rabbits, and about the background of any particular rabbits you’re interested in. A reputable seller should always be happy to answer your questions. For instance: “What do you feed your rabbits?”; “Do they receive regular veterinary care?”; “What can you tell me about this rabbit’s parentage?”; “Has this rabbit had any illnesses, and if so, how were they treated?” Ask for references if you want to buy from a breeder and contact some of these clients to see if they’re satisfied. A quality breeder should be willing to offer a written health guarantee, which gives you the right to return the rabbit within a certain period if a health issue arises. Summary:","completion":"Animal shelters or rescues, unlike pet stores, usually have staff who understand how to care for rabbits better. These places also ensure rabbits get nicer care and make lots of bunny friends. When you adopt a rabbit from a shelter or rescue, you're giving a lovely home to a rabbit who really needs it, rather than encouraging more and more rabbits to be born just to stay in pet stores. The people at the shelters or rescues are really nice and can answer all of your questions about the rabbits, and even though the rabbits from there might cost a bit more at first, they often come with all their shots and medical treatments so you don't have to spend more money later. Some pet stores get their rabbits from big places that only care about money, not how happy or healthy the rabbits are. Shopping at pet stores only makes this problem worse. These store-bought rabbits might get sick more often, too. Always ask lots of questions in pet stores, and if they can't answer, find another place that can! Some rabbit breeders can be good, but you must be careful and find those who really love their rabbits and look after them well. Always check where the rabbits live and feel free to ask lots of questions. Good sellers should always be able to answer them. They should also be able to give you a written promise that you can bring the rabbit back if he gets sick soon after you take him home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie plot title: Without Warning Movie plot: A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge.

Article: Meanwhile, prepare a baking dish by lightly coating the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray. If you have a large, heavy-bottomed, oven-proof skillet, you do not need to prepare a separate baking dish. The entire meal can be prepared in this oven-proof skillet. Add the oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until it becomes notably smooth and glossy. This can take a minute or so. Mix the flour and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place the ingredients in the bag, zip closed, and shake quickly to distribute the salt evenly throughout the flour. Alternatively, you could combine the flour and salt in a wide bowl with shallow sides. Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in. Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined. Add the steak to the flour and salt in the plastic bag and seal the bag closed. Give it a good shake so that all sides of the beef are coated in flour. If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 60 minutes in your preheated oven. Slow baking in liquid is another ideal cooking method for round steaks, which tend to be fairly lean and not very tender. The slow cooking process helps the meat break down more, and the liquid prevents the beef from drying out. Uncover the dish and sprinkle the beef with the cheese. Return it to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted. You could add more cheese than the recipe calls for, if desired, but adding more cheese may increase the amount of cooking time since a thicker layer will require more time to melt.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that needed a quiet corner to rest his aching head?, using the article: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Article: The Internet streets are in a major buzz today (Sept. 13) after rumors began circulating that Jay Z announced that he and Mrs. Carter have another baby on the way. While hitting the Stade de Paris stage for their ‘On The Run’ tour finale (and HBO special), Mr. Carter allegedly reworked the lyrics on his “Beach Is Better” interlude to include the line “‘cause she pregnant with another one.” The above photo has also been pointed to in support of the rumor. While the receipts of said announcement are scarce, a video has also been making its Web rounds in which Hov’s improvisation is supposedly audible: If it is indeed true that Blue Ivy will be joined by another young Carter, Jay Z and Beyonce’s Paris tour stop has been chock full of surprises. Nicki Minaj was also on-hand for her first performance of the “Flawless” remix. Meanwhile, naysayers point to the beer in Bey’s hand in a recent Instagram post as an indicator that she is not with child: But we all know Queen Bey is one for surprises. Could congratulations be in order? Stay tuned. ||||| When Beyoncé and Jay Z first planned their current On the Run tour, they must have hoped that they would be able to experience the best of both worlds: By night, they’d play to sold-out crowds of adoring fans, and by day, they’d have plenty of time to spend together and with their daughter Blue Ivy, 2. But things haven’t quite worked out that way. Instead, the married superstars have been haunted by divorce rumors ever since early May, when surveillance camera footage of a vicious, startlingly physical fight between Jay and Beyoncé’s sister Solange went public, leading to a torrent of reports about the 44-year-old rapper’s alleged infidelities. OK! News: Will Beyonce and Jay Z Split After The On The Run Tour Wraps? A source confirms that things got very dark between the couple in the aftermath of that incident: “Beyoncé is not dumb, and she knows that where there’s smoke, there’s fire. She couldn’t see any way out other than divorce.” Now, though, the source says Beyoncé and Jay seem to have reconciled, and, furthermore, that they’re hiding a life-changing secret: Beyoncé, 33, may be pregnant with their second child. OK! News: Go Inside Kim and Kanye’s Bizarre Marriage “For the last month, Jay has been fiercely protective of her, just like he was when she was expecting Blue Ivy,” the source says. “He’s ￼been doing everything he can to ensure that Bey is in a stress-free bubble. He’s informed their entire entourage that they need to use relaxed voices, mellow lighting and listen to only soft music, and he’s said that all of the food Beyoncé eats should be organic. He’s really doing his best to make sure that she’s as comfortable and healthy as possible.” Plus, the source says, it’s been at least that long since anyone has seen Beyoncé drinking booze. “At one point, she was ordered a glass of champagne backstage to celebrate the tour’s success, but she politely declined and even rubbed her belly, maybe unconsciously. She hasn’t had a sip of alcohol since.” OK! News: Kendall Jenner is Changing Her Name for her Modeling Career Nothing’s been confirmed, but that’s not unusual for the pair. “Beyoncé is a little superstitious, especially since she had a miscarriage before Blue,” says the source. “This is exactly the way they acted last time she was pregnant: tight-lipped until they were ready to break the big news—which they did in a huge way at the 2011 MTV VMAs!” Still, some fans may wonder how Beyoncé and Jay went from discussing divorce to expanding their family in such a short span of time. “The truth is, they’re both desperate to make things work,” the source confides. And their much-ballyhooed net worth is only a small piece of the puzzle. Between them, they run a near billion-dollar empire (as Bey acknowledged in her recent “Flawless Remix” with the new lyrics “Sometimes sh*t go down when it’s a billion dollars on an elevator”), and this tour alone is expected to gross 100 million. “Business has always been a part of their relationship,” the source says. “But for Bey, family is the most important thing, and the idea of breaking hers up is strictly a worst-case scenario.” OK! News: Joan Rivers Rushed to Hospital, in Stable Condition For months, the source says, Beyoncé struggled with what to do about her troubled marriage: “She’s been under an incredible amount of pressure.” The ugly dissolution of her parents’ union—which ended in 2010 when word leaked that her father had conceived a child during an 18-month affair with an actress—also weighed heavily on her mind. “She doesn’t want to stay in an unhappy marriage,” the source says. In early August, though, she and her husband were finally able to take some time to discuss their future. “Beyoncé had been holding in her emotions, but she had to let them out,” the source reveals, adding that tears were shed on both sides. “She told Jay that even though he’s denied cheating, she’s finding it hard to believe him. Still, she loves him and relies on him. She told Jay that she doesn’t want to live without him.” OK! News: How Brad and Angelina Pulled Off Their Surprise Wedding Now that Jay’s getting a second chance, he’s determined not to mess it up. “He’s given instructions to his team that female groupies need to be kept at least ten feet from him, and a member of his entourage has to be with him at all times,” the source says. It’s not that he’s afraid of temptation, the source explains, it’s just that he doesn’t want to risk so much as a whisper about him cheating: “He doesn’t want to make the slightest misstep.” And both Jay and Beyoncé are dedicated to fixing their other problems. “They’ve been brainstorming ways to make sure they don’t develop a distance between them again, like keeping their nights apart to a bare minimum,” the source says, adding that the two have even hired a therapist to travel with them to help the healing process. Naturally, they’re also hoping that adding a new member to the Knowles-Carter clan will strengthen their union. As the source explains, “Blue Ivy lit up their whole world when she was born.” It’s no surprise, then, that “they both believe that having another child will make their marriage stronger than it’s ever been.” Of course, a new baby doesn’t always improve his or her parents’ relationship (and in fact it can often do just the opposite). That’s why Beyoncé and Jay Z have concrete plans to do everything they can to reconnect before they have another child. “The US tour is over, and once they play their Paris dates on September 12 and 13, they’re going to spend some quality time alone.” The relationship has improved, but they know that they’re not completely out of the woods yet. “It will take time,” the source says. “But they’re in this for the long haul. And they’d better enjoy their quiet time while they can, because it won’t be much longer till they have another baby around!” PHOTOS: Prince Harry’s New Girlfriend Looks Exactly like Kate Middleton Do you think now is a good time for Bey and Jay to give Blue a sibling?

The magazine was told by a source, “For the last month, Jay has been fiercely protective of her, just like when she was expecting Blue Ivy,’’ the couple’s 2-year-old daughter. “He’s been doing everything he can to ensure that Bey is in a stress-free bubble.’’ Radar’s source added that the power couple’s entourage has been warned to speak in “relaxed’’ voices and listen only to “soft music.’’ And Jay Z is insisting that his wife eat only organic food.’’ The two have been married six years. ||||| Does Bey have another bey-bey on the way?

Social media is swirling with pregnancy rumors after a clip from the concert features Jay Z changing the line 'I replace it with another one' to 'pregnant with another one' in the song 'Beach is Better.' (Myrna Suarez/WireImage) Reps for Jay Z and Beyoncé did not return requests for comment. The hip-hop power couple, already the parents of 2-year-old Blue Ivy, have been dogged by divorce rumors for months. But Jay Z’s tantalizing word play in Paris has changed the conversation — at least for now. Blue Ivy Carter is seen with her power-couple parents Jay Z and Beyoncé onstage during the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards last month. (Kevin Mazur/MTV1415/WireImage) The couple’s two-night stint abroad, which came to a close Saturday night at the Stade de France, is being filmed for an upcoming HBO special, according to People magazine.

Speculation erupted after their performance on the 'On The Run' tour finale in Paris, where Mr. Carter allegedly tweaked the lyrics of his song, “Beach Is Better” to say “‘cause she pregnant with another one.” Circulating alongside this rumor are the images and videos that fans claim support these pregnancy speculations, though no official announcement has been made yet. Adding fuel to the fire, Beyonce and Jay Z's Paris concert appeared ripe with surprises, one of which was Nicki Minaj's debut performance of the \\"Flawless\\" remix. On the other hand, skeptics pointed out a recent picture of Beyonce holding a beer as evidence she might not be pregnant. All this happens against a backdrop of rumors that their marriage was on the rocks, especially after a video leaked showing Solange, Beyoncé's sister physically attack Jay Z, igniting a series of unconfirmed allegations about Jay Z's supposed infidelities. Yet, an anonymous source claims that the couple seems to have reconciled and are even expecting a second child. Reports also stated that Jay Z has been highly protective of Beyoncé in the past month, reminiscent of his behaviour when she was expecting their firstborn, Blue Ivy. Allegedly, he requested a serene environment surrounded by mellow lighting, soft music, and organic food for his wife. Beyoncé has been known for her quiet approach when it comes to big announcements, such as keeping her previous pregnancy under wraps before announcing it at the 2011 MTV VMAs. This brings many fans to question how the couple moved from possible divorce to expanding their family. The unnamed source revealed that both Jay Z and Beyoncé were desperate to make their relationship work, placing their family's unity above their nearly billion-dollar empire. It appears they are fervent about fortifying their marriage and are counting on their possible second child to strengthen it. For them, family comes first. But some fans query if a new baby will actually be beneficial or detrimental to their relationship. Despite the speculations and allegations, their stance remains uncertain and undecided, with fans eagerly waiting for the final confirmation from the couple. They closed their US tour and after playing their Paris dates on September 12 and 13, promised to spend some \\"quality time\\" alone, sparking further speculation about another baby on the way. However, it's essential to note that all these observations and interpretations coming from different corners of the internet are unconfirmed. Until an official announcement is made by Jay Z, Beyonce, or their representatives, speculations remain speculations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The words left the portable clock-radio with the glow-in-the-dark face, rose through the pillow in the silence between jets preparing to touch down at LaGuardia and spilled into the ear of the boy whose parents thought he was sleeping. The voice of Jean Shepherd on WOR had, once again, cut across the cacophony of hormonal confusion and left Words to Live By on the wet, sandy clay of early teen-age evenings in Jackson Heights. Santa smoked Camels. What a beautiful line. There's something reassuring about the Great American Culture Machine that the stories of Jean Shepherd, who died last year, have achieved the status of Holiday Tradition. \\"A Christmas Story,\\" set with the northwest Indiana characters of Shep's childhood, runs continuously for 24 hours beginning Christmas Eve at 8 p.m. on TNT. Catch it at least once. Tape it. Tie a ribbon around the tape and give it as a Christmas present. It's a family movie in the best sense of the term, full of family love, without a mean bone in its sharply observed body. It makes \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" seem cynical and calculating. Fans of Jean Shepherd may consider it ironic that future archeologists will one day put his name up there with Gene Autry and Bing Crosby as 20th-Century commercial religious figures. This was the man, after all, who had the chutzpah to believe that us slick New York hipsters would listen to stories about the world caught between the ice, wind and snow and the steel-mill blast furnaces of Hammond, Ind. Yes, when you learn that Santa smoked Camels, it suggests that Christmas and its rituals are almost completely human. Yes, Christmas can be depressing for the poor slobs who expect that this year, this one next present will bring prestige, wealth and happiness. Yes, Christmas is a reminder that you are the kid, that parents hold all the cards and that the hand you get depended on where you sit at the table. But \\"A Christmas Story\\" also teaches this: There is value in the anticipation, in being prepared to receive - whatever you get or don't get this time. And this: It's okay to want something really, really, really hard. That's how the world works. Wanting that BB gun is why we make our beds, stop at red lights and eat our oatmeal. And this: There is always next time. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"\\"A Christmas Story,\\" a heartwarming, family-oriented film framed around Jean Shepherd’s recollections of his midwestern childhood, is acclaimed in this piece for its invaluable life teachings, including the importance of anticipation, the power of wishing and wanting, and the resilience to always look forward to next time. While it humorously points out Santa's fictional preference for Camel cigarettes, it serves as a reminder of the human nature of Christmas celebrations and its profound impact on children's perception of the world and their role in it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing. Which mountain attracts fewer tourists because of its caves?

Lindsey had good health insurance while Amy had minimal health insurance so Pick your answer from: [-] Lindsey had to pay a lot of money out of pocket.. [-] Amy had to pay a lot of money out of pocket..","completion":"Amy had to pay a lot of money out of pocket. The varying degrees of health insurance coverage significantly influenced their overall financial obligations for medical expenses. The fact that Lindsey had good health insurance provided her with various benefits, such as access to a broader network of healthcare providers, lower co-payments, and extensive coverage for necessary treatments or procedures. This ultimately meant that Lindsey's insurance took care of the majority of her medical bills, leaving little for her to pay out of pocket. On the other hand, Amy's minimal health insurance unfortunately offered her meager assistance in covering her healthcare expenses. With limited access to healthcare providers, coupled with higher co-payments and restrictive coverage for treatments and procedures, Amy found herself facing substantial medical bills that were not covered by her insurance plan. This lack of coverage forced her to pay a significant amount of money directly from her personal finances to cater to her healthcare needs. Such disparities between health insurance coverage options can greatly impact an individual's overall wellbeing and finances. Ideally, all individuals should have access to robust health insurance that protects them from bearing the brunt of unexpected medical expenses. However, the reality is that many people often settle for minimal coverage, perhaps due to affordability constraints or lack of understanding about the importance of comprehensive health insurance. Amy's situation serves as a reminder of the significance of making informed decisions when it comes to health insurance plans.

However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him.

The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn't hurt either.

Thames Valley Police are appealing for witnesses to Tuesday's accident.","completion":"Title: Tragic Accident Claims Life of Schoolboy in Didcot The small town of Didcot in Oxfordshire, England, is mourning the tragic loss of Freddie Perry, a schoolboy who died after suffering a serious head injury during a car accident. The incident occurred on Tuesday, when Freddie was struck by a black Nissan Micra driven by his sister's teacher. The young boy was taken to the hospital for treatment but, unfortunately, succumbed to his injuries a day later. Freddie was described by his parents as a fantastic brother to his two sisters, Rhiannon, 14, who has Down's Syndrome, and Eloise, 11. Their heartfelt words reveal the profound sense of grief and sorrow that this close-knit family is experiencing as they grapple with the sudden and devastating loss of their beloved son and brother. The town of Didcot is in shock, as such a tragedy is never expected to occur within one's community, let alone among those that are so closely connected. The driver of the Nissan Micra was, in fact, the teacher of Rhiannon - making it an even more tragic and distressing event for all involved. The full details of the accident have yet to be disclosed, but Thames Valley Police are currently investigating the matter and have issued an appeal for witnesses. The community has already begun to come together in support of the Perry family during this trying time, with friends and neighbours offering their condolences and assistance as needed. School officials, teachers, and fellow students are also deeply affected by the untimely death of young Freddie, who had undoubtedly touched the lives of many throughout his short time on earth. As Thames Valley Police continue their appeal for witnesses to the accident, they are urging anyone with any relevant information to come forward immediately. It is essential for both the community and the grieving family that the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident are clarified and any necessary actions be taken, in order to prevent such heart-wrenching occurrences from happening again in the future. While the authorities carry on with their diligent work, it is essential for the people of Didcot and neighbouring areas to rally around the Perry family and provide them with the love, support, and understanding they need during these dark days. Although nothing will ever wholly diminish the pain and loss that they are experiencing, collective warmth and sympathy from the community may, at the very least, help to soften the edges of this tragedy. In conclusion, the sudden and tragic departure of Freddie Perry has left an indelible mark on the souls of all those who knew and loved him in the quiet town of Didcot. As the community comes together to provide solace, strength, and support to the bereaved family, it is important to remember that each day is a gift, and that it is our responsibility to hold our loved ones close and cherish the time, experiences, and bonds we share with them."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Few progressives would take issue with the argument that, significant accomplishments notwithstanding, the Obama presidency has been a big disappointment. As Mario Cuomo famously observed, candidates campaign in poetry but govern in prose. Still, Obama supporters have been asked to swallow some painfully \\"prosaic\\" compromises. In order to pass his healthcare legislation, for instance, Obama was required to specifically repudiate his pledge to prochoice voters to \\"make preserving women's rights under Roe v. Wade a priority as president.\\" That promise apparently was lost in the same drawer as his insistence that \\"Any plan I sign must include an insurance exchange...including a public option.\\" Labor unions were among his most fervent and dedicated foot soldiers, as well as the key to any likely progressive political renaissance, and many were no doubt inspired by his pledge \\"to fight for the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act.\\" Yet that act appears deader than Jimmy Hoffa. Environmentalists were no doubt steeled through the frigid days of New Hampshire canvassing by Obama's promise that \\"As president, I will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming—an 80 percent reduction by 2050.\\" That goal appears to have gone up the chimney in thick black smoke. And remember when Obama promised, right before the election, to \\"put in place the common-sense regulations and rules of the road I've been calling for since March—rules that will keep our market free, fair and honest; rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms\\"? Neither, apparently, does he… Indeed, if one examines the gamut of legislation passed and executive orders issued that relate to the promises made by candidate Obama, one can only wince at the slightly hyperbolic joke made by late night comedian Jimmy Fallon, who quipped that the president's goal appeared to be to \\"finally deliver on the campaign promises made by John McCain.\\" None of us know what lies inside the president's heart. It's possible that he fooled gullible progressives during the election into believing he was a left-liberal partisan when in fact he is much closer to a conservative corporate shill. An awful lot of progressives, including two I happen to know who sport Nobel Prizes on their shelves, feel this way, and their perspective cannot be completely discounted. The Beltway view of Obama, meanwhile, posits just the opposite. That view—insistently repeated, for instance, by the Wall Street Journal's nonpartisan, non-ideological news columnist, Gerald Seib—is that the president's problem is that he and his allies in the Democratic Party \\"just overplayed their hand in the last year and a half, moving policy too far left, sparking an equal and opposite reaction in the rightward direction.\\" And Newt Gingrich, speaking from what is actually considered by these same Beltway types as the responsible center of the Republican Party, calls him \\"the most radical president in American history\\" and \\"potentially, the most dangerous\\" as he urges his minions to resist the president's \\"secular, socialist machine.\\" Personally, I tend more toward the view expressed by the young, conservative New York Times columnist, Ross Douthat, that Obama is \\"a doctrinaire liberal who's always willing to cut a deal and grab for half the loaf. He has the policy preferences of a progressive blogger, but the governing style of a seasoned Beltway wheeler-dealer.\\" Or as one of Obama's early Chicago mentors, Denny Jacobs, explained to his biographer David Remnick, Obama is a pol who learned early that \\"sometimes you can't get the whole hog, so you take the ham sandwich.\\" But the truth, dear reader, is that it does not much matter who is right about what Barack Obama dreams of in his political imagination. Nor is it all that important whether Obama's team either did or didn't make major strategic errors in its first year of governance: in choosing to do healthcare before financial reform; in not holding out for a larger, more people-focused stimulus bill, in eschewing a carbon tax; or in failing to nationalize banks and break up those that are \\"too big to fail.\\" Face it, the system is rigged, and it's rigged against us. Sure, presidents can pretty easily pass tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful corporations. They can start whatever wars they wish and wiretap whomever they want without warrants. They can order the torture of terrorist suspects, lie about it and see that their intelligence services destroy the evidence. But what they cannot do, even with supermajorities in both houses of Congress behind them, is pass the kind of transformative progressive legislation that Barack Obama promised in his 2008 presidential campaign. Here's why. *** The American political system is nothing if not complicated and so too are the reasons for its myriad points of democratic dysfunction. Some are endemic to our constitutional regime and all but impossible to address save by the extremely cumbersome (and profoundly unlikely) prospect of amending the Constitution. Others are the result of a corrupt capital culture that likes it that way and has little incentive to change. Many are the result of the peculiar commercial and ideological structure of our media, which not only frame our political debate but also determine which issues will be addressed. A few are purely functions of the politics of the moment or just serendipitous bad luck. And if we really mean to change things, instead of just complaining about them, it would behoove us to figure out which of these choke points can be opened up and which cannot. For if our politicians cannot keep the promises they make as candidates, then our commitment to political democracy becomes a kind of Kabuki exercise; it resembles a democratic process at great distance but mocks its genuine intentions in substance. We live, as Tony Judt has written, in an \\"age of forgetting,\\" and nowhere is this truer than in our political discourse. Rarely do we stop to remind ourselves that, as a New York Times editorial put it, Obama \\"took office under an extraordinary burden of problems created by President George W. Bush's ineptness and blind ideology.\\" The economy was tanking: for the decade between 2000 and 2009, real growth was at its lowest point since the 1930s, and the fact that two-thirds of all economic gains went to the top 1 percent of the population meant stagnation at best for most workers, actual decline for many. Clear environmental threats had been allowed to fester. The Bush Justice Department was engaged in what appears to be widespread criminal action in a host of areas. We were fighting two wars, hamstrung by the hatred of most of the world's citizens, and operating torture chambers (and lying about it) across the globe. What's more, based on the theory of the \\"unitary executive\\" Bush and Cheney were claiming near dictatorial powers to ignore both houses of Congress and even the courts when it suited their purposes. What was his successor to do? Should he bail out the banks? Nationalize them? Break them up? Allow Detroit to die? Invite the firing of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of teachers, police, firefighters and emergency workers by state and local governments strapped by falling tax revenues? Allow the deficit to explode or the economy to implode? Should he close Guantánamo and Bagram prisons? End rendition? Get out of Iraq? Reverse signing-statements? Outlaw domestic spying? Cut carbon emissions? And by the way, exactly how would he accomplish these things—and simultaneously? By legislation? By executive fiat? By magic? Believe me, I could go on. ||||| If imitation is the highest form of flattery, the \\"tea party\\" movement must be honored. In an effort to replicate the tea party's success, 170 liberal and civil rights groups are forming a coalition that they hope will match the movement's political energy and influence. They promise to \\"counter the tea party narrative\\" and help the progressive movement find its voice again after 18 months of floundering. The large-scale attempt at liberal unity, dubbed \\"One Nation,\\" will try to revive themes that energized the progressive grassroots two years ago. In a repurposing of Barack Obama's old campaign slogan, organizers are demanding \\"all the change\\" they voted for -- a poke at the White House. But the liberal groups have long had a kind of sibling rivalry, jostling over competing agendas and seeking to influence some of the same lawmakers. In forming the coalition, the groups struggled to settle on a name. Even now, two of the major players disagree about who came up with the idea of holding a march this fall. In this respect, at least, the liberal effort already resembles the fractious tea party movement. In February, some tea party groups skipped a long-planned gathering in Nashville in protest of alleged profiteering by convention organizers. Tea partiers have also argued about which candidates represent the movement. Despite the friction among liberal groups, the effort behind \\"One Nation\\" was born of a certain necessity: At one of the first meetings, Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, said, \\"Raise your hand if you can push your part of the agenda all by yourself.\\" No hands shot up. Indeed, a promised overhaul of immigration law is virtually dead this year. Legislation that labor unions say would make it easier for them to grow their membership are stalled in Congress. The jobless rate is 15.4 percent for blacks and 12.4 percent for Hispanics, compared with 8.6 percent for whites. \\"Having been confronted with the specter of the tea party . . . we felt it urgent to organize the majority of this country, which voted in 2008 and has gone back to the couch,\\" said Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP. \\"We've been split off in different directions.\\" The groups involved represent the core of the first-time voters who backed President Obama -- including the National Council of La Raza, NAACP, AFL-CIO, SEIU and the United States Student Association. (The effort is separate from the Democratic Party's plan to spend 50 million trying to reach those same voters.) Their aha moment happened after the health-care overhaul passed this spring. Liberal groups, who focused their collective strength to push the bill against heavy resistance, felt relevant and effective for the first time in a long while. That health-care coalition -- composed of civil rights groups, student activists and labor leaders -- liked the winning feeling. \\"In many ways, the bitter fight for health-care reform has painfully highlighted that we must go back to the grassroots organizing that won us the election in the first place,\\" said George Gresham, president of 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. \\"We must reassert our strength as the social movement that ushered Obama into office.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The Obama presidency has been considered a big disappointment by many progressives, who feel that the promises made during his 2008 presidential campaign were not delivered upon. Some of the reasons for this include the complicated American political system, the effect of corrupt capital culture, and the peculiar commercial and ideological structure of the media. Upon entering office, Obama faced numerous problems, from the economic crisis and environmental threats to the ongoing war efforts and the need for significant policy reform. Expectations were high, and many question whether Obama's campaign promises were realistic or merely idealistic. The progressive movement has since sought unity to counter the influence of groups such as the Tea Party and revive the energy that fueled their activity during Obama's campaign. Coalition-building among progressive and civil rights groups is an attempt to regain their political voice, but also an acknowledgment that the support and advocacy for policy change cannot be reliant on single organizations or individuals. Despite the disappointment with the Obama presidency in certain respects, the progressive movement continues to look for ways to drive policy and change, both within and outside the Democratic Party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Choose your answer from: * No * Yes Answer:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not specifically address the original question about how UV light activates fluorescence. A more detailed and appropriate answer would be: Ultraviolet (UV) light activated fluorescence occurs when certain materials, known as fluorophores or fluorescent substances, absorb the energy from UV light and re-emit the energy as visible light, resulting in fluorescence. The process can be broken down into several stages: 1. Absorption: When UV light interacts with a fluorophore, the energy of the UV photon excites the electrons of the fluorophore to a higher energy level, known as the excited state. This transition is typically rapid, occurring in femtoseconds (10^-15 seconds). 2. Excited-state events: Once the fluorophore reaches the excited state, various processes can occur. One of the most common is internal conversion, in which the energy from the absorbed photon is rapidly distributed to other vibrational and rotational energy levels in the molecule. This results in the relaxation of the fluorophore to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state. 3. Emission: The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is now re-emitted as a photon, resulting in fluorescence. Since some energy has been lost during the excited-state events, the emitted photon generally has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed photon. This emission process usually occurs in nanoseconds (10^-9 seconds). 4. Relaxation: Following the emission, the fluorophore relaxes back to its original ground state, ready to undergo the cycle again if exposed to UV light. To summarize, UV light activates fluorescence by exciting the electrons of fluorescent substances to a higher energy level. These excited electrons then lose some energy and return to their ground state, emitting visible light in the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Observe the snake's body patterns: Some common venomous snakes in the U.S. have specific patterns like the rattlesnake with its rattle at the end of its tail, the copperhead with its dark, thick bands, and the coral snake with its colorful red, black, and yellow bands. Always remember to be extra careful around all snakes, and never try to pick them up or get too close to them.

Please answer the following question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. What is Chan's father's job?

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over? is inside the article: In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up., can you guess it ?

Later at the airport flower shop, while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted, Danny is accosted by employee Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who recognizes him as a talent agent and begs him for a start in show business. Danny refers her to Holiday Inn and gives her a pass to Ted's club. That night, Linda sits at the performer's table with Jim, who pretends he owns a big club and isn't sure he could use an act like Hanover and Dixon.

Question: What nightmare does Block have ? Movie title: Tightrope Movie plot: The film opens with a young woman, Melanie Silber (Jamie Rose), walking home late one night in New Orleans down a deserted street. A sound startles her and she drops her packages. A man approaches her. She relaxes when she sees he is wearing a police uniform. He watches her enter her house, then the camera pans down and we see the man isn't wearing regulation police boots, but sneakers.The next day Silber's body is found naked across her bed. She has been raped and strangled. It looks like one in a series of murders so it is passed to a task force headed by Detective Wes Block (Clint Eastwood). Block is recovering from a recent divorce and is trying to put his life back together while caring for his two daughters: 11 year-old Amanda (Alison Eastwood) and 9 year-old Penny (Jenny Beck).Block's partner, Det. Molinari (Dan Hedaya) notes that while the girl was apparently attacked at about 9:15PM, she wasnt killed until after mid-night and wonders about the delay. Block notes that the killer left a half-eaten brownie and an empty coffee cup and comments that the killer was taking his time because he was enjoying what he was doing to the victim.The lab reports that the killer wore sneakers and left traces of barley and tiny glass fragments behind. His blood type is \\"O.\\" Marks on her wrists suggest that the Silber was handcuffed.Back at the office Block's boss, (Bill Holliday) is annoyed at him for the lack of progress on these cases. Block is also being pursued by rape prevention worker Beryl Thibodeaux (Geneviève Bujold) who wants to talk to him about the case. She finally catches up with him, but he doesn't want to divulge any information to her that might compromise the investigation. She tells him they should put up posters warning women of the danger, but Block states that would only terrify the city's female population. Thibodeaux replies that given the circumstances, maybe they should be terrified.The victim was prostitute and Block goes to interview a Sarita (Regina Richardson) a woman Silber sometimes... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Tightrope, Detective Wes Block's nightmare is his inner struggle with his dark desires and personal demons, which parallel the killer he is hunting. As he investigates the string of serial murders involving women in New Orleans, he starts to see similarities between the killer's behavior and his own disturbing fantasies. This realization troubles Block, making him question his morality and self-control. Throughout the film, Block is seen engaging in encounters with women that involve elements of domination and submission, reflecting his suppressed desires. This internal conflict becomes a central theme in the movie, creating a great deal of psychological and emotional turmoil for Block. As he continues pursuing the killer, he is not only attempting to solve the case, but also to confront and understand these darker aspects of his own personality. In summary, the nightmare that Detective Wes Block faces in Tightrope is his confrontation with his own dark desires and personal demons that he must confront and deal with in order to maintain control and successfully carry out his job of hunting down the serial killer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Available choices: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","completion":"(1). Yes, it follows that \\"Within three hours the horse had ceased to be living.\\" The statement \\"The horse died within hours\\" suggests that the horse's death occurred within a short span of time. The phrase \\"within hours\\" is an indication of a relatively quick occurrence, implying that the event in question (in this case, the horse's death) happened in a matter of hours or less. The statement \\"Within three hours the horse had ceased to be living\\" is compatible with the original statement. It specifies a more precise time frame - within three hours - but still falls within the broader \\"within hours\\" scope. The fact that the horse had ceased to be living, which essentially means the same thing as \\"the horse died,\\" demonstrates that the two statements are indeed aligned in substance.

I thought I might get some good ideas if I went down to the hospital. I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact.

Write the next sentence in the following story. How to take action to prevent school violence Become aware of individual risk factors. There are certain risk factors that may increase the likelihood of a young person becoming violent. By becoming aware of these risk factors, you can better recognize when a young person needs additional support, guidance, or therapy to prevent violent outcomes.","completion":"Some of these risk factors can include, but are not limited to, a history of abuse or neglect, exposure to violence at home or in the community, social isolation, involvement in gangs or criminal activity, drug or alcohol abuse, mental health issues, and lack of access to mental health support, resources or positive role models. To address these risk factors, it's essential to foster a supportive and inclusive school environment that encourages open communication, understanding, and empathy among all members of the school community. Establishing a safe space for students to express their thoughts, emotions, and concerns will provide them with a sense of belonging and help reduce feelings of isolation that can often lead to anger and violence. In addition, schools should consider implementing programs that promote emotional wellbeing and resilience, such as conflict resolution workshops, peer mediation, mental health awareness initiatives, and diversity and inclusion training. Providing students with tools to manage their emotions, learn effective communication, and connect with their peers will undoubtedly contribute to a culture of respect and mutual understanding. Engaging parents, caregivers, and other family members in the process is also a crucial aspect of preventing school violence. Many times, they can provide valuable insights into their child's behavior and emotional well-being. By fostering a partnership between the school and home, educators and families can work together to identify potential risk factors, respond to concerning signs, or address any issues that may arise. The school should also collaborate with local law enforcement, community organizations, and mental health professionals to establish protocols for responding to and preventing instances of violence. This partnership will ensure that schools have access to resources and expertise to help create a comprehensive plan for violence prevention and intervention. One essential component of any violence prevention plan is regular monitoring and evaluation. It's necessary to continuously assess the effectiveness of implemented programs, strategies, and policies, making changes as needed to ensure that they are effectively addressing the identified risk factors and mitigating the potential for violence. Lastly, it's essential to empower students themselves to take action and become part of the solution. Encourage young people to stand up against bullying and promote respect, inclusivity, and kindness both within and outside of the school environment. By training students to become upstanders and fostering a sense of responsibility to look out for one another, schools can create a strong foundation for a more harmonious and violence-free community. In conclusion, by taking a proactive and multifaceted approach to preventing school violence, schools can help mitigate the risk factors that might contribute to violent behaviors in young people. By fostering awareness, understanding, and support within the school community, and collaborating with families, law enforcement, and mental health professionals, schools will move closer to creating an environment where students can grow, learn, and thrive free from the fear of violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the funeral of her secretive mother, Ellen Leigh, Annie delivers a eulogy explaining their fraught relationship and her mother's extremely private life. A week after, Steve is informed that Ellen's grave has been desecrated, while Annie thinks she sees an apparition of Ellen in her workshop. At a support group for the bereaved, Annie reveals that the rest of her family suffered from mental illness that resulted in their deaths. To attend a party, Peter lies that he is going to a school event, and Annie forces him to take Charlie with him. Unsupervised, Charlie eats cake containing nuts, which she is allergic to, and falls into anaphylactic shock. As Peter drives her to a hospital, Charlie leans out of the window for air.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. Question: \\"How much is the registration fee hike and what is cited as the reason for the lack of generated funds?\\" Response: \\"The 49 dollar hike is due to the lagging economy, low interest rates not regerating enough revenue to cover services?\\" Pick from: 1). no; 2). yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"The registration fee hike is, indeed, proposed to be 49, broken down into two separate measures - a 42 increase aimed at supporting pro-bono services and an additional 7 to assist lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The reason cited for the lack of generated funds is the combination of low interest rates and a struggling economy, which has resulted in less money being generated through the Lawyers' Trust Fund. Thus, the response correctly answers the question, so the answer is: 2). yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This struggle could result in a range of symptoms and potential complications. Some possible outcomes for Abby include: 1. Fever: As mentioned in the article, Abby does experience a fever. This is a natural response by her body to fight off the infection. The elevated temperature can cause chills, sweating, weakness, and muscle aches. 2. Pain and inflammation: Abby's infected cut on her hand might become swollen, red, and painful due to the body's immune response to the bacteria. This process could further exacerbate her condition if left untreated. 3. Fatigue and weakness: Abby might feel unusually tired and weak while her body diverts its energy resources to battle the infection. This can make it difficult for her to perform daily tasks, including traversing the rope bridges and branches mentioned in the article. 4. Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite: The illness could cause gastrointestinal distress, leading to nausea, vomiting, or a reduced appetite. These symptoms could contribute to dehydration and malnutrition if not addressed. 5. Sensitivity to light and sound: Abby's throbbing headache could be accompanied by an increased sensitivity to light and sound, making it challenging for her to be in environments with bright lights or loud noises. 6. Delirium or confusion: In severe cases, the infection could affect Abby's mental state, causing her to become disoriented, confused, or even delusional. This would make it hard for her to make rational decisions and could further hinder her recovery. 7. Risk of spreading the infection: As Abby is exposed to others while she is ill, there's a possibility that she might inadvertently transmit the bacteria to other people or objects in her environment, potentially leading to the spread of the illness. 8. Persistent symptoms or complications: If the infection is not sufficiently treated or does not respond well to treatment, Abby could experience lingering symptoms or develop secondary infections, further complicating her recovery. It is essential for Abby to receive appropriate medical attention and follow the advice of the medicine woman to increase her chances of recovery and minimize the risk of long-term health issues.

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal (George Dzundza), gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank, to serve as execution for disabling and killing a Russian tank crew. As the new khan, following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the opportunistic scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank's crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people's code of honour: milmastia (hospitality), badal (revenge), and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal (called \\"Tank Boy\\" during World War II for destroying a number of German tanks when he was a child soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad) demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple of attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen.

A:","completion":"The Soviet helicopter offers to help the lost tank crew by providing directions and guiding them out of the valley to rejoin their unit.

Press response to the album was mixed, with AllMusic citing the album as \\"disturbing and powerful\\", and Kim Nelly of Rolling Stone calling it \\"genuinely offensive satanic drivel\\". King said \\"that album was my most lackluster performance\\", although Araya called it a \\"late bloomer\\" which eventually grew on people.Slayer returned to the studio in spring 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album. Following the backlash created by South of Heaven, Slayer returned to the \\"pounding speed of Reign in Blood, while retaining their newfound melodic sense.\\" Seasons in the Abyss, released on October 25, 1990, was the first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner Russell Simmons over creative differences.

Coats responded that the intelligence community stands by its findings. \\"The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the President and policymakers,\\" Coats said in a statement. \\"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.\\" Grigory Dukor/Reuters Keenly aware there was a problem after his news conference in Helsinki with Putin, Trump met with top advisers Tuesday morning to discuss what to do about it. Sources tell ABC News the president himself came up with the idea of the \\"would\\" versus \\"would not\\" clarification, telling aides he had seen the clip, realized he misspoke and wanted to make a statement. Those involved with crafting the statement, according to sources, were: White House adviser Steven Miller, press secretary Sarah Sanders, Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Bill Shine, Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp and National Security Adviser John Bolton. The president also discussed it with Newt Gingrich, who had called on Trump to clarify his comments in Helsinki on “the U.S. intelligence system and Putin,” calling the remarks “the most serious mistake of his presidency.” Late in the process, Vice President Mike Pence also asked to see the statement. The line \\"it could have been a lot of people\\" was not part of the prepared remarks. The president's aides were also not particularly surprised the president said it. Leah Millis/Reuters By Tuesday, the president said he used the wrong words and meant to say there was no reason \\"it wouldn't be Russia\\" behind election meddling. \\"I said the word would instead of wouldn't...I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself.\\" The seeming contradiction in Trump's comments on Wednesday sparked anew congressional backlash as lawmakers press for clarification on the president's stance. \\"A BIG discrepancy between President Trump’s statement and DNI Coates’ warning. It’s imperative we get to the bottom of what is going on so we can be prepared to protect ourselves in advance of the 2018 elections. My personal view: the Russians are at again,\\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican tweeted. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, tweeted: \\"The Russians continue efforts to undermine Western democracies, including ours. The President is wrong and needs to heed the warnings from our Intelligence Community, including DNI Dan Coats.\\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was quick to put out a statement challenging the president's comments. “Mr. President, it is time to stop taking the word of a KGB agent over that of your own intelligence officials. Russia interfered in our 2016 elections. They’re actively trying to do it again. You must wake up to that fact,\\" Schumer said. \\"We won’t be able, as a nation, to fight back against foreign interference in our elections if the Commander in Chief doesn’t even acknowledge that it’s a real problem. The American people will not trust that you will protect them if you continue to put your interests ahead of those of our country.” ABC News' Jonathan Karl contributed to this report. ||||| Asked if Russia was still targeting the U.S. with cyberattacks, President Donald Trump shook his head and said, “No.” The director of national intelligence has said the opposite. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Trump newly undercuts top U.S. intelligence chief on Russia President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the Russian government is no longer trying to meddle in U.S. elections, contradicting his director of national intelligence, who has said that Kremlin-ordered attacks are ongoing. In response to a shouted question from a reporter as to whether Russia was still targeting the U.S., Trump shook his head and said “no.” He quickly followed with a brief monologue arguing that his administration has been tougher on Russia than any of its predecessors and that “President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly better than the media.” Story Continued Below At her Wednesday press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the president had said Russia is no longer attacking the U.S. but that he instead had been saying \\"no\\" to taking additional questions from reporters. She said the White House believes the threat of Russian election interference remains. \\"The president said thank you very much and was saying 'no' to answering questions,\\" Sanders said, despite the fact that Trump kept on talking to reporters after the exchange. \\"The president and his administration are working very hard to make sure that Russia is unable to meddle in our elections as they have done in the past and as we have stated.\\" Pressed by MSNBC reporter Hallie Jackson on the president's earlier exchange with reporters, Sanders said that she had spoken to the president about his remark and that he was not answering a reporter's question when he said \\"no.\\" The press secretary insisted that she was not walking back the president's comments, telling reporters, “I’m interpreting what the president said. I’m not reversing it.\\" Morning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The president’s assertion that Russia’s is no longer launching attacks against the U.S. contradicts remarks from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who said last month that “it is 2018, and we continue to see Russian targeting of American society in ways that could affect our midterm elections.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was the second time in as many days that the White House has sought to argue that the president either did not say or did not mean something that he was clearly captured on video saying. Trump has come under withering criticism over the last 48 hours over his remarks at a bilateral press conference on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, where the U.S. president said “I don’t see any reason” why Russia \\"would\\" be behind 2016 cyberattacks intended to impact that year’s U.S. presidential election. Trump’s willingness to accept Putin’s denial that the Kremlin had been involved over the assessment of his own intelligence agencies prompted a tidal wave of rebukes, which in turn pushed Trump to take a rare step — admitting a mistake — on Tuesday when he told reporters that he had meant to say that he saw no reason why Russia “wouldn’t” have been behind the 2016 attacks. It's also not the first time that Trump has directly undercut Coats in recent days. In an interview with CBS News on Saturday, Trump said he doesn't know if he agrees with a warning from Coats that the U.S. digital infrastructure is vulnerable to a large-scale attack. \\"Well, I — I don't know if I agree with that. I'd have to look. But I have a lot of respect for Dan,\\" Trump said. \\"And that's where he is, and that's what he does. Again, we're working on it very hard. We're upgrading things at a very rapid pace.\\" Coats has not been silent as Trump has undermined his statements. On Monday, after Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on Russia's election meddling, Coats issued a blunt statement backing the intelligence community. \\"The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the president and policymakers,\\" said Coats, who took over as U.S. director of national intelligence in March 2017. \\"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.\\" Coats also has had a rocky history with Trump. It was reported in June 2017 that Coats had told associates that Trump asked him if he could help get then-FBI Director James Comey to back off the agency's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Coats reportedly decided that such an action would be inappropriate. ||||| poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201807/2225/1155968404_5810899811001_5810826159001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Trump-Putin meeting Trump plays semantics on Russian meddling The president appeared Wednesday to walk back his walk-backs on Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he was tripped up by a double negative. On Wednesday, the White House claimed he was simply declining to respond when he replied “no” to a reporter’s question about whether Russia is still targeting America’s democratic government. Trump’s position on Russian interference in America’s elections has devolved into a game of semantics, with Trump loudly casting doubt on the assessment of his own intelligence agencies only to half-heartedly backtrack when his comments draw forceful condemnation, including from members of his own party. Story Continued Below For the third day in a row, Trump and his top aides spent Wednesday clarifying the president’s remarks on Russia, attempting to breathe new meaning into comments that Trump made not in secretive closed-door meetings, but on national television or on Twitter for all to see. During a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether Russia was continuing to target U.S. elections. He looked at the reporter and said “no,” adding that the United States, in his estimation, has been tougher on Russia than any of his predecessors. That assessment would contradict the U.S. intelligence community, including Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who has said Russia continues to target the United States. But White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters later Wednesday afternoon that Trump had in fact not said anything of the sort. “The president said thank you very much and was saying no to answering questions,” Sanders told incredulous reporters in the White House briefing room, adding later, “I talked to the president. He wasn’t answering that question.” The reporter who asked the question, ABC News White House correspondent Cecilia Vega, tweeted later Wednesday, “Yes, he was looking directly at me when he spoke. Yes, I believe he heard me clearly.” Getting a lot of questions about my exchange with @realDonaldTrump today. Yes, he was looking directly at me when he spoke. Yes, I believe he heard me clearly. He answered two of my questions. Here’s the full exchange: pic.twitter.com/F3QmDSFzpT — Cecilia Vega (@CeciliaVega) July 18, 2018 In effect, the White House is asking Americans to choose whom they believe: the president, or their own lying eyes. Trump has for months danced around directly and forcefully condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. And while he has said he accepts intelligence conclusions that Russia is to blame for the hack of the Democratic National Committee and other incursions, he has also repeatedly held out the possibility that other entities could be responsible. It played out the same way on Tuesday during Trump’s tightly choreographed mea culpa. Reading from a script, Trump claimed he meant to say there’s no reason to believe it “wouldn’t” have been Russia that meddled in the U.S. election, blaming the confusion on a “double negative.” But Trump threw in an ad-libbed line that appeared to undercut his statement. “Could be other people also,” he said.

In an interview with CBS News that aired Wednesday evening, Trump stressed that he agreed with U.S. intelligence officials that Russia meddled in the 2016 election — adding that he holds Putin responsible. “He’s in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country,” he said. “So, certainly, as the leader of the country, you’d have to hold him responsible.” Speaking of Putin, the president told anchor Jeff Glor: “I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted. I think that Dan Coats is excellent. … I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something, it means a lot.“ “He‘s a great guy,” Trump said of Coats. “He's a great patriot. He loves his country. And he's only going to say what he truly believes.“ But on Wednesday morning, Trump had taken a more defiant posture, insisting that his meeting with Putin would prove to be a great success “in the long run.” “While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting” Trump tweeted. “Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!” The president also insisted that, contrary to the barrage of criticism he has faced over the last 48 hours, many in the “higher ends” of the U.S. intelligence community thought highly of his performance at a bilateral press conference with Putin, where he publicly sided with the Russian president over his own intelligence agencies. Those who have been critical of him, the president said, are “haters” upset that he has a warm relationship with Putin, a former KGB agent who the U.S. intelligence community has concluded with “high confidence” ordered the 2016 cyberattacks targeting the U.S. election process. “So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki,” Trump wrote on Twitter early Wednesday morning. “Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!” “Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!” Trump added later, echoing language Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) used recently to label critics of the president. Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2018 At the same cabinet meeting where he appeared to suggest Russia is no longer digitally attacking the U.S., Trump returned to the argument that no president in history has been as tough on Russia as he has, pointing to sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department, the two West Coast Russian embassies the State Department has ordered closed, and the dozens of Russian diplomats expelled. \\"We are doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia, and there’s been no president ever as tough as I have been on Russia,\\" he told reporters. \\"All you have to do is look at the numbers, look at what we’ve done, look at sanctions, look at ambassadors not there, look at, unfortunately, what happened in Syria recently. I think President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly better than the media.\\" Trump’s defense follows a whirlwind few days in which he found himself perplexed by the severe blowback to his remarks in Helsinki. He was initially reluctant to walk back his comments, but senior administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and chief of staff John Kelly encouraged him to “clarify” his remarks, according to a person familiar with the issue, prompting his unusual statement in the Cabinet Room on Tuesday. At the White House and among the president’s outside advisers, Trump’s Tuesday statement was received with mixed reviews. One person close to the president worried it made him look weak and said his explanation was ham-fisted, while another said it was necessary given the outcry over his Helsinki news conference, which bothered even Trump’s most ardent defenders. The mood in the White House on Tuesday was decidedly dark. After the White House Office of Management emailed staff about a routine internet outage, staffers turned to gallows humor, joking that Russia was behind it, according to an administration official. Still, Trump’s confidants remain confused about exactly why the president insists on subtly questioning the intelligence community and maintaining such a close relationship with Russia. One person close to the president said his best explanation is that Trump has a deep-seated fear of being seen as an illegitimate president and he worries that fully endorsing the assessment that Russia interfered in the election will lend credence to claims that Hillary Clinton should have won. While Trump’s opening months in office have been regularly punctuated with controversy, the criticism he has faced in the wake of his meeting with Putin has been especially fierce. The bilateral summit in Helsinki was seen by many as overly warm and absent the type of confrontation that many have argued was merited by Russia’s recent bad behavior on the world stage. Though Trump claimed Wednesday that his performance at Monday’s meeting had been a hit within the intelligence community, his apparent willingness to accept Putin’s denial that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 race prompted blowback from Coats. “We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,” Coats wrote in a statement earlier this week. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201807/1217/1155968404_5809443562001_5809135545001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" That evaluation was echoed on Wednesday night by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said that Russia was still working to “sow divisiveness” in the U.S. “The Intelligence community’s assessment has not changed. My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day,” Wray said in an interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. Perhaps further evidence that Trump’s news conference performance was poorly received came Tuesday, when the president took the rare step — for him — of admitting a mistake when he told reporters that he had misspoken at Monday’s event. When he said, “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia, Trump explained, he had meant to say “wouldn’t,” as in “I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.” Defenders of the president, usually numerous among Republican ranks, have been few and far in between in the wake of Trump’s Helsinki summit, with GOP lawmakers – including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – venting emotions ranging from frustration to outrage over Trump’s remarks. But counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway appeared Wednesday on “Fox & Friends,” the morning news program the president is known to prefer, where she parroted Trump’s defiance, blaming the media for its emphasis on the Kremlin’s election meddling and the Obama administration for the state of U.S.-Russia relations. “When the media talk about the Supreme Court, they only talk about abortion. When they talk about Russia and U.S., they only talk about election meddling. And yet, we have faith in the American people, who is our ultimate audience, to listen to everything this president is saying,” Conway said Wednesday. “This nonsense that you shouldn’t even meet with the leader of the Kremlin, where were the media when other presidents did exactly that?” she said. “And it’s really ridiculous to not acknowledge that it is failures of the last administration.” And Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who is close to Trump and was harshly critical of his performance in Helsinki, credited the president for making Tuesday’s correction. Like Conway, Gingrich was also eager to cast blame on the Obama administration, a frequent deflection tactic of the White House and its allies. “This was a very important moment for this president. If he had not fixed this, if he had not had that talk in the Roosevelt Room, if he had not gone on to reinforce the American intelligence system, I think we would be in a much bigger mess right now,” Gingrich said. “I’m really delighted that he took a serious look at it. He hates to correct himself. That’s not who he is. But I think he did the right thing, and I think he did it well.” Eleanor Mueller, Quint Forgey and Connor O’Brien contributed to this report. ||||| Trump: 'No,' Russia is not targeting the United States 4:43 PM ET Wed, 18 July 2018 | 01:09 President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Russia is no longer targeting the United States with cyber attacks, a conclusion that is at odds with the one repeatedly asserted by Trump's own intelligence services. During a meeting of his Cabinet on Wednesday, Trump was asked by a pool reporter whether Russia is still \\"targeting\\" the United States. \\"No,\\" said the president. Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Trump was saying \\"no\\" to more questions, and not answering the specific question about Russia. Trump did keep talking to reporters at the Cabinet meeting, however. He repeated his claim that no other president had been as tough on Russia as he has. \\"I think President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly a lot better than the media,\\" Trump said. Dan Coats, Trump's director of national intelligence, had a very different assessment about Russian efforts to influence U.S. elections as recently as Monday. In a statement, Coats said: \\"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.\\" And on Friday, Coats compared Russia's current cyber efforts to warning signs that emerged before the 9/11 attacks. \\"The warning lights are blinking red again,\\" Coats said at a Washington, D.C. think tank. \\"Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.\\" Trump's latest round of comments also came one day after the president touted his administration's aggressive efforts to prevent future Russian meddling. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The White House has clarified President Donald Trump's recent comments on whether Russia targeted the U.S. with cyberattacks, claiming that his \\"no\\" response was in reference to taking questions from reporters, not an answer to the question itself.

Paragraph: Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

It's a delicate blend of thriller, comedy, drama, conspiracy, buddy movie (I hate that term, too), incredibly moving acting, incredible noir-ish (not noir) cinematography and one of the most haunting scores in cinema. Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) is the aimless playboy yin to Alex Cutter's hardcore Vietnam veteran yang and Moe (Lisa Eichorn) is Alex's cynical wife. All three drink and exist in a modest house in a Santa Barbara neighborhood in the 70's. Until one rainy night in an alley, where Bone steers his foreign convertible when the engine dies, and half-sees a man depositing a woman's body in a trash can. Alex takes Bone and Moe to a parade hours after Bone is grilled by detectives. \\"That's him,\\" a weary Bone tells Cutter, when oil magnate JJ Cord rides by on a white horse.... ...and this is where it takes off. Cutter enlists the victim's sister and goes on a single-minded plan to extract vengeance. How this is accomplished is the wildest and poignant tale you're ever going to see and the atmosphere is Lynchian, but pre-Lynchian. The plot is not conventionally excuted and this a treat for the willing. Again, a career best for John Heard as the intense Cutter, Jeff Bridges is simply incredible, and the gifted Lisa Eichorn evokes the gamut of raw emotions.

How to replace coffee with healthier alternatives Drink tea instead of coffee. Green tea is perhaps the most obvious choice if you want to replace coffee with a healthier alternative. The drink contains plentiful antioxidants, and also provides other benefits such as a decreased risk of heart and cardiovascular disease. Possible answers: -- If you find yourself avoiding tea altogether, try drinking ginger tea. Many tea companies offer alternative ginger (commonly called \\" tea \\") options. -- Tea is not a substitute for natural juices, but its overall flavor is surprisingly similar to coffee. The benefit of the green tea is that it follows a healthy carbohydrate-rich carbohydrate balance (bk), rather than a sugar or sodium content. -- Keep in mind that green tea has caffeine-although significantly less than coffee. Black teas also are a source of caffeine, but herbal teas typically are caffeine-free. -- Drink bacon in place of regular coffee. Just as with many of the methods above, you won't end up with a really delicious bacon sandwich or other fillable treat on your plate.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

What is the best way to: shoe sole","completion":"The best way to prepare, attach, and maintain a shoe sole depends on the type of shoe, the materials used, and the purpose of the footwear. Here is a detailed overview of the essential steps involved: 1. Choose the right materials: Depending on the type of shoe, select the appropriate sole material. Common materials include leather, rubber, and polyurethane (PU). Leather is durable and provides natural breathability, while rubber offers excellent grip, durability, and waterproof qualities. Polyurethane soles are lightweight, flexible, and provide good cushioning. 2. Prepare the shoe upper: Before attaching the sole, ensure that the shoe upper is adequately prepared. This process may involve the following steps: a. Cutting: Based on the shoe design, cut the upper material accurately to create its overall shape. b. Sewing and assembling: Sew the different sections of the upper material together, taking care to stitch them securely. Attach necessary components, such as eyelets, laces, and reinforcements. c. Lasting: Place the upper on a shoe last (mold) to give the shoe its final shape. Secure the upper around the last using glue, staples, or nails. 3. Prepare the insole and midsole: Insoles and midsoles enhance comfort and provide additional cushioning or support. Choose the appropriate materials based on the desired characteristics, and cut them to match the shape of the shoe last. 4. Attach the sole: a. Roughening and cementing: Roughen the surface of the insole or midsole on the bottom of the shoe, as well as the corresponding surface on the shoe sole. This process will create a better bonding surface for the adhesive. Apply shoe cement or adhesive to both surfaces following the manufacturer's instructions. b. Press and adhere: Carefully align the shoe sole with the shoe bottom, ensuring proper positioning of the toe, heel, and sides. Press the two surfaces firmly together to create a strong bond. Use a machine press or apply manual pressure for a specified duration to ensure adequate adhesion. c. Stitching (optional): In some cases, especially for leather-soled shoes, stitching the sole to the upper may be necessary for increased durability. Use a stitching machine or hand-stitching techniques like Goodyear Welt or Blake Stitch to secure the sole. 5. Finishing touches: a. Trimming: Trim any excess material from the sole edges using a knife, ensuring that the shape aligns perfectly with the upper. b. Sanding and buffing: Smooth and polish the edges of the sole and any visible seams. This process enhances the overall appearance and comfort of the shoe. c. Adding outsoles or protective features: For added durability or specific purposes (like hiking or dancing), attach rubber outsoles, heel caps, or toe protectors to the bottom of the shoe. 6. Maintain the shoe sole: To ensure that the shoe sole lasts longer and performs optimally, follow these maintenance tips: a. Clean: Regularly clean the sole using a stiff brush, mild soap, and water. Remove any debris, dirt, or mud to avoid sole damage. b. Condition: For leather soles, apply leather conditioner or oil to keep them moisturized, supple, and to prevent cracking. c. Repair or replace: Periodically inspect the sole for signs of wear or damage. Promptly repair minor damages or replace the sole entirely when needed to prolong the life of the shoe. When carried out correctly, these steps will help create a well-constructed and durable shoe sole that enhances your shoe's overall performance and comfort."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'We have written asking for the return of the medal from the Sydney 2000 Games,' an IOC official told Reuters on Thursday after the decision to take away the last major title won by the disgraced American. The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs – after years of denials – is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. But hinting at an unexpected turn of events, OPTIONS: - 2000 Sydney Olympics teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - AP teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - American teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Armstrong teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - IOC teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - International Olympic Committee teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - James Nye teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Lance Armstrong teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Olympic Games teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Oprah Winfrey teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Reuters teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' - Sydney 2000 Games teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.'","completion":"Correct Answer: - Oprah Winfrey teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' Explanation: The passage gives a context that Lance Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Hence, it makes sense if Oprah Winfrey is the one hinting at an unexpected turn of events. Other options are incorrect due to the following reasons: - Armstrong, Lance Armstrong: These options are incorrect because Armstrong is being interviewed and making admissions, so it wouldn’t make sense for Armstrong to say he didn't come clean in the expected manner. - IOC, International Olympic Committee: IOC can't be the speaker as their role in the story so far was to revoke Armstrong’s medal; there's no suggestion they would know what to expect from Armstrong’s confession. - The entities like James Nye (the presumed author), Reuters, AP, Olympic Games, Sydney 2000 Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics, and American are not directly involved in the event (i.e., Armstrong's confession) to hint an unexpected turn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, they had assessed the idea's feasibility and merits and ultimately concluded that it was not suitable or viable. Therefore, it does not follow that they thought it was an excellent idea. To understand why they might have thought this way and why the idea was turned down, it's essential to consider certain factors that could have influenced their decision. These factors may include: 1. Lack of feasibility: If an idea is not feasible, it means that it cannot be easily implemented in reality or may not produce the desired results. Examples of infeasibility could arise due to technical limitations, financial constraints, or inadequate resources needed for successful implementation. 2. Insufficient benefits: An idea may be turned down if its perceived benefits do not outweigh the potential drawbacks or risks. The benefits must be compelling enough to justify the time, effort, and resources required for execution. If the benefits do not seem significant enough, the idea may be considered \\"not a good idea.\\" 3. Uncertainty and risks: An idea may be deemed unsuitable if it is associated with significant uncertainty or possible risks. These could include potential legal challenges or safety concerns, reputational risk for the organization, or threats to the environment. 4. Lack of support: For an idea to be successful, it must typically garner support from various stakeholders, such as team members, management, or external partners. If there is a lack of support for a proposed idea, its chances of failure increase, leading to it being turned down. 5. Timing: Sometimes, a proposal may be turned down simply because of bad timing. For example, an idea may be considered \\"not a good idea\\" if it is presented during an economic recession or when the organization is undergoing significant changes that could jeopardize the idea's success. Ultimately, the statement indicates that they did not think it was an excellent idea at that time. However, this does not necessarily mean that the idea will permanently be considered unsuccessful. Sometimes, an idea may initially face rejection and then later gain traction as circumstances change, new information becomes available, or stakeholders become more open to reconsidering previous opinions. In such cases, the once-dismissed idea could eventually be reevaluated and even be deemed as excellent in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

This federal-state partnership is focused on creating self-sustaining economic development for the people of Appalachia by addressing issues that have led to disparities in areas such as income, employment, education, and living conditions. By prioritizing local engagement, the ARC aims to create sustainable change that will allow the region to thrive in the long term. However, the goal is not to make the region better than the rest of the society, but rather to ensure that the people of Appalachia have equal access to opportunities, resources, and a better quality of life. This indicates that the ARC's mission is to lessen the disparities between different regions in the United States and empower the people of Appalachia to grow and prosper at a similar rate to their fellow citizens.

Chicago hosted the 1-10 San Francisco 49ers in week thirteen, the fourth straight year in which the two teams met and the third at Soldier Field and in December, with the Bears winning 2016's game 26-6. Offensively, the Bears rushing game had an opportune chance to succeed against a 49ers defense that was ranked 30th against the run (28th overall with 374.2 total yards allowed per game), allowing 129.5 rushing yards per game, 42 runs of at least ten yards in 2017 and three running backs to record 100-yard games. For the 49ers offense, it was led by Jimmy Garoppolo in his first start for the team, and Garoppolo was supported by a West Coast offense that ranked 12th in yards after the catch. Although the 49ers were ranked last in the league in time of possession, they were tied for the most drives of ten plays or more with 22, with 19 resulting in scores (including eight ending in touchdowns). In contrast, the Bears offense's 140 points were the fewest in the NFL, while also having a league-high 40 drives end with punts. As such, Jeff Joniak stressed the importance of playing \\"loose\\" by letting \\"it rip in every phase.\\" With San Francisco's optimism in Garoppolo, the Bears had \\"to ruin that excitement and create some of its own.\\" Former Bears kicker Robbie Gould opened the game by converting a 33-yard field goal. While the Bears punted on their first drive, Kyle Fuller recorded his first interception since 2015 when he yanked the ball from Louis Murphy's hands, which set up Mitchell Trubisky's eight-yard touchdown pass to Dontrelle Inman. Gould added a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter to narrow the gap to one point, but Tarik Cohen responded with a 61-yard punt return touchdown; after catching the punt at his 39-yard line, Cohen ran back to his 24, moved to his right, then ran forward for the touchdown. With 24 seconds left in the first half, Gould kicked his third field goal (35 yards), followed by one from 34 yards in the third quarter to put the 49ers ehind by two. Early in the fourth quarter, Cohen returned a punt for 67 yards to the 49ers' 16-yard line, but Ben Braunecker was penalized for an illegal block in the back to negate the play and force the Bears to start at their own 14. Although the offense was able to reach 49ers territory, it could not progress further and the Bears eventually punted. Pinned at his eight with 5:27 remaining in the game, Garoppolo led the 49ers downfield to set up Gould's game-winning 24-yard field goal with four seconds left. On the final kickoff, Josh Bellamy handed the ball to Cohen, who threw to Eddie Jackson before the play was stopped as Cohen's lateral was a forward pass. The loss dropped the Bears to 3-9, their fourth straight losing season and worst stretch since they had five consecutive from 1996 to 2000. It was also the Bears' fifth straight loss, the first such losing streak since Marc Trestman's final season as the Bears head coach in 2014.

Math problem: Solve -11*k + 34 = 5*k + k for k. What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -11*k + 34 = 5*k + k, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. The equation currently contains like terms on the right side (5*k + k). Combine these terms by adding them together: 5*k + k = 6*k. The equation becomes: -11*k + 34 = 6*k Step 2: Isolate the variable (k) on one side of the equation. To do this, add 11*k to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -11*k term on the left side: -11*k + 11*k + 34 = 6*k + 11*k This simplifies to: 34 = 17*k Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 17: 34 / 17 = 17*k / 17 This simplifies to: 2 = k So the solution to the equation -11*k + 34 = 5*k + k is k = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sticky rosin improves the pitcher’s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring towns, Pine town and Willow town, used different types of woods for lumber et al. Willow town used hardwoods, while Pine town used softwoods. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town used fewer conifers for their sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Pine town used softwoods and Willow town used hardwoods for their lumber and other purposes. Conifers are softwood trees, and so Pine town predominantly used conifers. Since resin, the sticky substance oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, comes from conifers, it can be deduced that Pine town utilized more conifers for that purpose. Therefore, Willow town used fewer conifers for the sticky substance (resin) than Pine town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Born in New York City on June 23, 1964 as Joseph1 Hill Whedon, and being a third-generation TV writer, he is a son of Tom Whedon, a screenwriter for Alice in the 1970s and The Golden Girls in the 1980s, and a grandson of John Whedon, who worked on The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s and The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s. His mother, Ann Lee (nee Jeffries) Stearns, originally from Kentucky, was a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon, and an aspiring novelist. His parents had both acted, and appeared in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. Whedon is the younger sibling of Samuel and Matthew Whedon and older sibling of writers Jed and Zack Whedon. In 1997, Whedon created his first television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.2 The series depicts Buffy Summers, the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of \\"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie\\". Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero. This conception came from \\"the very first mission statement of the show, which was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it\\". The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers, and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces. Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy's story. The series received numerous awards and nominations, including an Emmy Award nomination for the 1999 episode \\"Hush\\". The 2001 episode \\"The Body\\" was nominated for a Nebula Award in 2002, and the fall 2001 musical episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award. The final episode \\"Chosen\\" was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form Hugo Award in 2003. All written and directed by Whedon, they are considered some the most effective and popular episodes of the series. Scholar A. Asbjorn Jon recognized that the series has shifted the way vampires have since been depicted in popular culture representations. Since the end of the series, Whedon has stated that his initial intention was to produce a \\"cult\\" television series and acknowledged a corresponding \\"rabid, almost insane fan base\\" that subsequently emerged. In June 2012, Slate magazine identified it as the most written about popular culture text of all time. \\"[M]ore than twice as many papers, essays, and books have been devoted to the vampire drama than any of our other choices--so many that we stopped counting when we hit 200\\". A lifelong comic book fan, Whedon authored the Dark Horse Comics miniseries Fray, which takes place in the far future of the Buffyverse. Like many writers of the show, he contributed to the series' comic book continuation, writing for the anthology Tales of the Slayers, and the main storyline of the miniseries Tales of the Vampires. Whedon and the other writers then released a new ongoing series, taking place after the series finale \\"Chosen\\", which he officially recognizes as the canonical eighth season. Whedon returned to the world of Fray during the season eight-story arc \\"Time of Your Life\\". Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine was published from August 2011 to September 2013, for which Whedon wrote \\"Freefall, Part I-II\\" (with Andrew Chambliss).","completion":"This text is about Joss Whedon, born as Joseph Hill Whedon, an American screenwriter, producer, director, and comic book writer.

The Andromeda Strain is a 2008 science fiction miniseries, based on the 1969 novel of the same name, a team of scientists who investigate a deadly disease of extraterrestrial origin, written by which American best-selling author, screenwriter, film director and producer best known for his work in the science fiction, medical fiction and thriller genres? Answer:","completion":"The Andromeda Strain, a 2008 science fiction miniseries, is based on the 1969 novel of the same name written by Michael Crichton. Michael Crichton was an American best-selling author, screenwriter, film director, and producer, who was best known for his work in the science fiction, medical fiction, and thriller genres. Born on October 23, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, Michael Crichton pursued a career in writing and filmmaking alongside his studies in medicine at Harvard Medical School. His adeptness in blending scientific concepts and thrilling narratives transformed him into a renowned and influential writer. In addition to The Andromeda Strain, authored during his fourth year at Harvard, Crichton has a long list of notable works to his name. Perhaps one of his most famous works is Jurassic Park, published in 1990, which was later turned into a hugely successful film franchise directed by Steven Spielberg. The book and its sequel, The Lost World, gave life to the fascinating idea of cloning dinosaurs through genetic engineering, captivating readers and audiences alike. Other popular novels by Crichton include Sphere (1987), which was adapted into a film in 1998 starring Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson; Congo (1980), made into a movie in 1995; and Disclosure, a 1993 novel later turned into a film starring Demi Moore and Michael Douglas. Alongside writing and directing, Michael was the creator and executive producer of the successful medical drama television series ER which premiered in 1994. Throughout his career, Crichton utilized his medical and scientific background to craft stories centered around groundbreaking and speculative technological advancements. These works posed questions about the ethical and moral limitations of such advancements while also providing engaging narratives that entertained millions of readers and viewers. Unfortunately, Michael Crichton passed away in 2008, but his work continues to influence the world of literature, television, and film. The Andromeda Strain miniseries, which was released in the same year as his passing, serves as a testament to the enduring and thought-provoking work of this talented American author and creator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not possible to tell whether Venus and Mars can never have life again. While the premise suggests that both Venus and Mars were once capable of supporting life and have since become inhospitable, it does not provide any information on the potential for life to arise again in the future. The statement acknowledges that the planets have undergone changes over hundreds of millions of years, demonstrating that conditions on these planets are not static. Moreover, several factors could influence future habitability, including natural processes or human intervention. For instance, some scientists have proposed terraforming as a way to alter a planet's environment to make it more suitable for life. While this idea is still theoretical and has numerous ethical and technical challenges, it represents one possibility for future life on these planets. Furthermore, the concept of life itself is complex and constantly evolving. While current scientific knowledge suggests that life as we understand it could not survive in the present conditions of Venus and Mars, future discoveries may reveal previously unknown forms of life or adaptations that could exist in these harsh environments. Additionally, planetary conditions and atmospheres can potentially change due to various factors such as volcanic activity, solar radiation, meteorite impacts, or shifts in a planet's orbit or magnetic field. These changes could potentially create environments more favorable to life, albeit perhaps not identical to Earth's conditions. In conclusion, while the premise provides evidence that Venus and Mars were once more hospitable to life and became inhospitable, it does not give any definitive information on whether or not these planets can never have life again. There are many possibilities, and our understanding of life and planetary conditions is still evolving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

According to the minutes of the Scottish Ambulance Service board meeting, in April last year Bond Air Services was informed of a crack \\"on the lower hub shaft flange of an EC135 main rotor following a routine inspection. \\"The manufacturer of the aircraft, Eurocopter, and the customer, the Scottish Ambulance Service, were immediately notified of the defect. The main rotor hub shaft was returned to Eurocopter, to allow them to investigate the cause of the crack. \\"A replacement component was fitted to the aircraft in question, which subsequently resumed operations for the Scottish Ambulance Service. At that time, thorough inspections of the entire EC135 fleet were conducted to ensure continued air worthiness prior to any further operations. The results of the inspections stated that the crack was an isolated case.\\" An airworthiness directive issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after Eurocopter reported the crack saw Bond \\"undertake detailed daily inspections of all its EC135s, including the main rotor blade bolts, as well as visual inspection of the upper and lower hub shaft flange areas. Since the beginning of April Bond Air Services have been working closely with Eurocopter to identify the exact cause of the defect.\\" However, after receiving a safety information notice, which said that cracks had been found in several other EC135 helicopters, Bond Air Services then decided as a safety measure to ground all of its EC135 helicopters. The minutes note: \\"This left large parts of the UK without air ambulance cover. Bond Air Services operate 22 Eurocopter EC135 helicopters across the UK and all were withdrawn, including the 2 Scottish Air Ambulance helicopters and Strathclyde police helicopter. \\"The recent identification of cracks in the lower hub shafts (the first occurrences in the 15-year history of the helicopter during which time 2.3m flight hours have been recorded) resulted in the decision to suspend flying until assurances were received from the manufacturer that it was safe to resume flight operations.\\" The minutes continue: \\"Eurocopter had not ordered that the fleet be grounded; they had urged operators to increase the frequency of checks on the EC135s. Bond chose to suspend flying until such time as they received reassurances from Eurocopter relating to safety of the EC135. Bond has received a letter from Eurocopter which guarantees the safety of the EC135 and the Scottish Ambulance Service has been given a copy of this letter. \\"While Bond Air Services have now introduced an agreed enhanced regime of safety checks – and the EC 135 helicopters resumed operations again at 07:00hrs on Wednesday 9 May [2012] – they remain concerned that Eurocopter have still to identify the root cause of the defect. \\"The EC135 mast rotor hubs are subject to pre-flight daily inspection, a detailed inspection at each major service interval (which is every 400hrs) and are removed, inspected, overhauled and refitted when the main rotor gearbox is overhauled at every 4,000hrs. These inspection schedules are in line with manufacturer and EASA instructions. Following identification of the crack, an additional inspection was initiated before every flight and a detailed engineering inspection to the mast rotor hubs every 10hrs.\\" Summary:","completion":"Last year, Bond Air Services, the company that leases the helicopter model that crashed into a Glasgow pub, temporarily grounded all of the aircraft due to safety concerns.

In both sentences, the same information is conveyed: Iwanaga became Agriculture Minister (or Minister of Agriculture) on August 11, 2005, and this occurred after Yoshinobu Shimamura's resignation. The differences lie in the sentence structure and the order in which the information is presented, but the overall meaning remains the same.

To answer the question: In the Han Dynasty, there were four main social classes, which were commonly referred to as the \\"Four Occupations\\" or \\"shi, nong, gong, shang\\" (士, 农, 工, 商). These classes were: 1. Shi (士) - Scholars, officials, and nobility: This class mainly consisted of educated individuals who held positions in government or were part of the ruling aristocracy. 2. Nong (农) - Farmers and agricultural workers: Farmers, who were considered essential to society due to their role in food production, made up this class. They were generally respected, though not wealthy compared to higher classes. 3. Gong (工) - Artisans and craftsmen: This class comprised individuals skilled in various crafts and trades, such as pottery, carpentry, and metalwork. 4. Shang (商) - Merchants and traders: Although merchants were vital to the economy, they were considered the lowest class because their wealth came from the labor of others. They were often restricted in terms of political power and social mobility. These four main social classes were not strictly separated, as some mobility was possible between them, particularly through education, notable service to the dynasty, or extraordinary accomplishments.

Gladiator school Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Asterix and Obelix: Gladiators of Gallia\\" Genre: Adventure, Comedy, Action Plot Summary: Asterix and Obelix, the famous indomitable Gauls, embark on an epic adventure to enter a gladiator school on a quest to save their friends and preserve their village's freedom. Along the way, they must use their wits, superhuman strength, and the magic potion that grants them spectacular powers to face a series of challenges, overthrow a wicked slave dealer and ultimately protect their homeland. Act 1: In their small Gaulish village, Asterix and Obelix enjoy a peaceful life, protecting their people from Roman occupation with the help of their druid Getafix's magic potion. News reaches the village that several of their close friends have been captured by a malicious slave trader, Crassus Decimus, during a fishing expedition. Decimus plans to sell them as slaves to Caesar's personal gladiator school in Rome, as a way to impress the Emperor with the indomitable Gauls' strength and skill. Act 2: Fearing for their friends' safety and determined to save them, Asterix and Obelix come up with a daring plan: they will join the gladiator school in Rome, pretending to be defectors wishing to serve Caesar. With Getafix's help, they create a 'special potion' that will trick the Roman authorities into believing they have truly lost their powers and are now ordinary men. Once inside the school, they will be able to locate their friends and escape together, showing the Romans that the Gauls' spirit of freedom will never be extinguished. Act 3: Disguised as gladiators, Asterix and Obelix embark on a treacherous journey to Rome. Along the way, they encounter wild beasts, cunning Roman soldiers, and other gladiator hopefuls seeking fame and fortune. To keep up their cover, they participate in various gladiatorial games, earning the admiration of their fellow gladiators and the growing suspicion of the school's sadistic owner, Crassus Decimus. Act 4: With time running out, Asterix and Obelix finally locate their captured friends in the bowels of the gladiator school. They discover that Decimus plans to sell their friends to the highest bidder, who will force them to fight to the death in a twisted spectacle to entertain the grueling audiences of the Roman Colosseum. Realizing that they will not be able to save their friends without bringing down Decimus, Asterix and Obelix execute a daring plot, using their superhuman strength and wits to defeat Decimus and his henchmen. Act 5: As Caesar himself arrives to attend the spectacle, Asterix and Obelix, along with their fellow gladiators and liberated friends, stage a dramatic revolt. The ensuing battle becomes a symbol of the Gauls' unbreakable spirit, demonstrating the futility of attempting to control or enslave them. With Decimus defeated and Caesar humbled, the Gauls return to their village, victorious and reunited with their friends. As they celebrate their triumph, the indomitable Gauls remain steadfast in their commitment to protect their way of life and resist any Roman attempts to invade their land. \\"Asterix and Obelix: Gladiators of Gallia\\" is a thrilling adventure filled with humor, heroism, and heart. By following Asterix and Obelix's journey to the heart of the Roman Empire, audiences of all ages will delight in this tale of friendship, courage, and the unbreakable human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Yemen: fighting breaks UN ceasefire less than one day after it took effect Saudi-led air strikes and heavy shelling between warring factions has shaken several cities in Yemen, residents said, violating a United Nations humanitarian truce that took effect just before midnight on Friday. The UN-brokered pause in the fighting was meant to last a week, to allow aid deliveries to the country’s 21 million people who have endured more than three months of bombing and civil war. A coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Iran-allied Houthi rebel movement – Yemen’s dominant force – since late March in a bid to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled to Riyadh, to power. That coalition said on Saturday that the Yemeni government in exile had not asked it to pause, according to a news flash on Saudi-owned Arabiya TV. Yemeni government officials were not immediately available to comment, but the UN secretary general’s office said before the truce that Hadi had “communicated his acceptance of the pause to the coalition to ensure their support”. Air raids pounded Houthi and Yemeni army units in the capital Sana’a and in the group’s stronghold province of Saada, along the border with Saudi Arabia. Fighting raged in the southern city of Taiz and the eastern province of Mareb, amid intense artillery exchanges between Houthi fighters and local militiamen backed up by Arab air strikes. In Aden, one of the country’s most deprived and war-torn areas, witnesses said Houthi forces fired mortars and Katyusha rockets towards opposition fighters based in northern areas and around the city’s international airport. Bombing by the Arab alliance and fighting have killed more than 3,000 people since 26 March. The Houthis, and their army allies, say their spread throughout the country is part of a revolution against a corrupt government and hardline Sunni militants, whom they say are allied to the opposition forces, and they vowed to keep up the fight despite the truce. Supplies of food, fuel and medicine have dwindled dangerously because of the fighting and a near-blockade by the coalition, spreading disease and hunger. “There have been very heavy air strikes and fighting across the country, seemingly unabated,” Unicef’s Yemen representative, Julien Harneis, said. Related: From Syria to Bosnia: Isis and its affiliates around the world “But while the fighting mostly doesn’t stop humanitarian aid being delivered to affected areas, the tragic thing is that it does impede the civilian population from going the last mile and being able to reach that assistance,” he added. Local officials in Aden said that Houthi fighters had allowed 25 trucks of medical aid into the besieged city on Saturday, but were holding up 40 other trucks full of food. All parties in Yemen’s conflict had welcomed the announcement of the truce and called for it to be extended. But the exiled government wants the Houthis to release prisoners and give up land they have seized in battle, while the Houthis say they doubt any calm will last.","completion":"A short time ago in Yemen, a big argument started between different groups of people who live there. Some countries nearby, like Saudi Arabia, decided to help one side because they didn't like the other side. To do this, they used airplanes to drop bombs, and both sides have fought with guns and other weapons. Because of all the fighting, it has been very hard for food and medicine to get to the people living in Yemen, and many of them have gotten sick or are very hungry. People from a group called the United Nations were worried about the people in Yemen, so they asked the fighting groups to take a break. They hoped this break would last one week, so everyone could get the help they need. The people in charge of Yemen agreed to this break, and it was supposed to start just before midnight on Friday. However, things didn't go as planned. Even though it was supposed to be peaceful, the fighting didn't stop, and the airplanes kept dropping bombs. This made it even harder for people who needed food and medicine to get the help they needed.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy, led to famine and political repression. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes West Belarus. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in Białystok. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The Brest Fortress, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the East for Germans.Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never...

The train is from the early 1980's and the power pack I had was even older, and needed to be replaced. This power pack works well with this train, and the lights in the cars only dim slightly as it slows down. The top speed is not super fast but if the train went much faster it might leave the tracks. It also seems to deal with shorts well; it cut the power when I accidentally put some metal across both tracks, and worked fine when I removed the short.

Question: Given the following context: With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the... answer the following question: What was the nickname given to the largest of the four sister ships that completed a record eastbound crossing?

Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity. Hint: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution.

Question: The gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","completion":"I apologize for not providing you the choices in your original question. However, I can give a detailed and long answer to the question of how the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on various factors. The gravitational force exerted by an object is determined by its mass and the distance to another object as described by Sir Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed by the formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where: - F is the gravitational force between the two objects - G is the gravitational constant, which has a value of approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2 - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects From this formula, we can deduce that the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on two main factors: 1. Mass: The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects. This means that if the mass of one object is doubled, the gravitational force between them will also double, assuming neither the mass of the other object nor the distance between the two changes. Similarly, if the mass of both objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them will increase four times. 2. Distance: The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two objects. This means that the force decreases as the distance increases. Specifically, if the distance between the two objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them will be only one-fourth of the initial force. Conversely, if the distance is reduced by half, the gravitational force will be four times stronger. Since the gravitational constant G does not change, the gravitational force is mainly dependent on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. Hence, to answer the question directly: the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its mass and the distance to another object."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we need to get rid of the -51 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding 51 to both sides of the equation: 51*d - 51 + 51 = 0 + 51 This simplifies to: 51*d = 51 Step 3: Solve for d.

Q:Information: - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Salamandridae is a family of salamanders consisting of true salamanders and newts. Currently, 74 species (with more expected) have been identified in the Northern Hemisphere - Europe, Asia, the northern tip of Africa, and North America. Salamandrids are distinguished from other salamanders by the lack of rib or costal grooves along the sides of their bodies and by their rough skin. - The Bosphorus (or ) or Bosporus (\\"Bósporos\\" ) is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching . - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\", \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. - Honshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kant plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands. - Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela. Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone. - Triturus is a genus of newts comprising the crested and the marbled newts , which are found from Great Britain through most of continental Europe to westernmost Siberia , Anatolia , and the Caspian Sea region . Their English names refer to their appearance : marbled newts have a green -- black colour pattern , while the males of crested newts , which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside , develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase . Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation - rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady , protection - rich land habitats close to their breeding sites . Males court females with a ritualised display , ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female . After fertilisation , a female lays 200 -- 400 eggs , folding them individually into leaves of water plants . Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land - dwelling juveniles . Historically , most European newts were included in the genus , but taxonomists have split off the alpine newt ( Ichthyosaura ) , the small - bodied newts ( Lissotriton ) and the banded newts ( Ommatotriton ) as separate genera . The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts ( Calotriton ) . Two species of marbled newts and six species of crested newts , formerly considered subspecies , are accepted , with one additional crested newt species suspected . Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap , hybridisation may take place . Although not immediately threatened , crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines , caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation . Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover - rich , natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected . All species are legally protected in Europe , and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - North Asia or Northern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of Siberia, and Russian Far East in the Asian portion of Russia the area east of the Ural Mountains. A large part of the region is also known as Asian Russia. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What island did Amelia Earhart crash her Lockheed Electra on? from the following article ? During the 1930s, the Navy contracted a 1.5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet's carriers to enter it. Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island. Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. A September 8, 1939, presidential emergency proclamation spurred the rapid construction of new facilities to prepare the island for additional operations. This included additional barracks, a new assembly and repair hangar, an administration building, a dispensary, a control...

Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \\"Heliocosma\\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile. - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae. - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name. - \`\` Lasperesia '' and \`\` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous \`\` Mexican jumping beans '' . - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'. Answer:","completion":"The subject entity in this context is the subfamily Olethreutinae, while the object entity with the relation of 'parent taxon' is the family Tortricidae.

Background: Leslie Feist was born on 13 February 1976 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her parents are both artists. Her father, Harold Feist, is an American-Canadian abstract expressionist painter who taught at both the Alberta College of Art and Design and Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. Her mother, Lyn Feist, was a student of ceramics from Saskatchewan. Context: In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her start in music when she founded and was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be confused with the English band Placebo). She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring the Ramones. At this concert she met Brendan Canning, whose band hHead performed immediately before hers, and with whom she joined in Broken Social Scene ten years later. In 1995, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from vocal cord damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1996. That year she was asked by Noah Mintz of hHead to play bass in his solo project Noah's Arkweld. She played the bass guitar in Noah's Arkweld for a year despite never having played bass before. In 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist for the band By Divine Right and toured with them throughout 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also played guitar for some live performances by Bodega, but was never an official member of the band. In 1999, Feist moved into a Queen West apartment above Come As You Are with a friend of a friend, Merrill Nisker, who then began to perform as electro-punk musician Peaches. Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches' shows, using a sock puppet and calling herself \\"Bitch Lap Lap\\". The two also toured together in England from 2000-2001, staying with Justine Frischmann of Elastica and MIA Feist appeared as a guest vocalist on The Teaches of Peaches. Feist appears in Peaches' video for the song \\"Lovertits\\", suggestively rubbing and licking a bike. Later, Feist covered this song with Gonzales (whom she met while touring with Peaches) on her album Open Season. In 2006, Feist contributed backup vocals on a track entitled \\"Give 'Er\\", which appeared on Peaches' album Impeach My Bush.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"__ was preceded by Napoleon III.\\" Context: \\"Although public opinion in Paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the Prussians, the Government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer, and that Gambetta's provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve Paris. President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Adolphe Thiers was preceded by Napoleon III as the leader of France. In the given context, we can see the turmoil that France went through after the fall of Napoleon III's regime, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. Napoleon III, also known as Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, was the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and served as the Emperor of the Second French Empire from 1852 to 1870. His reign came to an end after the disastrous defeat of the French army by the Prussian forces at the Battle of Sedan in September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. After this defeat, Napoleon III was captured by the Prussians and the Second Empire collapsed. In the aftermath of Napoleon III's capture, the French Government of National Defence was formed on September 4, 1870, in response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in France during the war. President Louis Jules Trochu, Jules Favre, and Léon Gambetta were among the key members of this temporary government. As described in the context, during the following months, the French forces struggled against the advancing Prussian army. The situation in Paris was dire, and the citizens were strongly against surrendering to the Prussians. However, the French government knew they could not defend Paris indefinitely and Gambetta's provincial armies were unlikely to succeed in relieving the city. Realizing the desperate situation they were in, President Trochu resigned on January 25, 1871, and Jules Favre took his place. Two days later, on January 27, Favre signed the surrender with the Prussians in Versailles, and the armistice came into effect at midnight. Despite this surrender, Léon Gambetta was furious and attempted a failed attack on German forces at Orleans. After a delegation of Parisian diplomats negotiated with Gambetta, he relented and stepped down on February 6, surrendering control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which ordered an immediate ceasefire across France. In the subsequent elections, Adolphe Thiers emerged as the new leader, becoming the Chief of the Executive Power in the French Third Republic. Thiers was a seasoned statesman who had previously served as a prime minister during the July Monarchy period and played a crucial role in negotiating peace with the victorious Prussians, putting an end to the Franco-Prussian War. Thus, Adolphe Thiers followed the rule of Napoleon III as the leader of France in the aftermath of the war and the establishment of the French Third Republic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem that looks like this: 93*a + 393*a + 5832 = 0 To solve this problem for \\"a\\", we will follow these steps: 1. Combine together the terms with \\"a\\" (like adding apples with apples) 2. Solve for \\"a\\" Let's begin with step 1. We have two terms with \\"a\\": 93*a and 393*a. We need to add them together: 93*a + 393*a When we add them, we get: (93+393)*a = 486*a Now, our equation looks like this: 486*a + 5832 = 0 Moving on to step 2, we want to solve for \\"a\\". To do this, we need to get \\"a\\" by itself on one side of the equation. So, we will subtract 5832 from both sides: 486*a = -5832 Now, to find the value of \\"a\\", we need to divide both sides by 486: a = -5832 / 486 When we divide -5832 by 486, we get: a = -12 So, the solution to the problem is a = -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Movie title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

Nothing RB LaDainian Tomlinson does on the ground really impresses the San Diego Chargers at this point. For that, the star running back must take to the air. Tomlinson seemed to be trying to jump out of Candlestick Park while hurdling the goal line on one of his four touchdown runs&#8212;and his elevation was the Chargers' inspiration. Tomlinson set a franchise record while seemingly spending most of the afternoon in the end zone, and QB Philip Rivers passed for a career-high 334 yards and two more scores in San Diego's 48-19 victory over San Francisco. Tomlinson got his third score 33 seconds before halftime, capping San Diego's 35-point first half and essentially finishing off the 49ers (2-4) with an astonishingly high leap over the goal-line pile. WR Bryan Gilmore and FB Moran Norris caught scoring passes as the Chargers gave up more points in the first half alone than they allowed in any of their first four games. But San Diego shut out San Francisco in the second half, with QB Alex Smith finishing 20 of 31 for 214 yards. San Francisco's offense has been better than expected heading to the club's bye week, but the defense has been just as bad as feared. Two weeks after giving up 41 points to the Chiefs, the 49ers seemed lost from the moment top CB Walt Harris was ruled out with a hamstring injury. This crushing blow put the 49ers record at 2-4. Answer this question: How many points did the Chargers win by?","completion":"To find out how many points the Chargers won by, we need to subtract the points scored by the 49ers from the points scored by the Chargers.

Step 1: Identify the points scored by each team Chargers' points = 48 49ers' points = 19 Step 2: Subtract 49ers' points from Chargers' points to find the point difference Point difference = Chargers' points - 49ers' points Point difference = 48 - 19 Step 3: Calculate the point difference Point difference = 29 The Chargers won by 29 points."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Located south of Libya, west of Sudan, and east of Niger, Chad is one of the largest countries on the African continent. Chad is landlocked and surrounded by six countries in total: Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Its extreme northern zone, the Tibesti Region, stretches into the Sahara Desert, while the southernmost part of the country is in the Sahel belt, where the savanna transitions into desert. N'Djamena, located on the southwestern border of Chad near Cameroon, is the capital and largest city of the country. It was founded in the early 20th century by the French and was originally named Fort-Lamy. It was later renamed N'Djamena in 1973, reflecting the country's break from its colonial past and its move toward a more independent identity. The city has grown rapidly in recent years, and functions as the main economic hub of Chad. Despite the political instability and conflicts that have beset Chad since its independence, N'Djamena continues to develop. It is known for its vibrant markets, impressive National Museum, and central Mosque. The official languages of Chad are Arabic and French, and the country is predominantly Muslim. Chad is also rich in gold and uranium and has significant oil reserves, but it remains one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world due to mismanagement and internal conflicts.

Input: Abstract: The archaeal ATPase complex PAN, the homolog of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome-regulatory ATPases, was shown to associate transiently with the 20S proteasome upon binding of ATP or ATPgammaS, but not ADP. By electron microscopy (EM), PAN appears as a two-ring structure, capping the 20S, and resembles two densities in the 19S complex. The N termini of the archaeal 20S alpha subunits were found to function as a gate that prevents entry of seven-residue peptides but allows entry of tetrapeptides. Upon association with the 20S particle, PAN stimulates gate opening. Although degradation of globular proteins requires ATP hydrolysis, the PAN-20S complex with ATPgammaS translocates and degrades unfolded and denatured proteins. Rabbit 26S proteasomes also degrade these unfolded proteins upon ATP binding, without hydrolysis. Thus, although unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding alone supports ATPase-20S association, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded substrates into the proteasome, which can occur by facilitated diffusion through the ATPase..

Hypothesis: The people are sitting in church. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis from the given premise. The premise and hypothesis present two distinct scenarios that don't link explicitly towards a common conclusion. The premise describes a situation where two people are standing next to a railing with a dog. It suggests an outdoor or at least an open environment that permits dogs. This scenario might imply a location such as outside a house, in a park, or at a subdivision where railings could be present. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests a completely different setting. It references two people sitting in a church, which typically has a more formal, solemn atmosphere and is generally an indoor setting. In many cases, animals like dogs are not permitted in such places due to respect, cleanliness, or noise precautionary measures. Based on these differences between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot logically connect the two together without further evidence or clarification. The setting, actions, and factors involved (like the dog) in each situation provide no immediate or clear route to inference. In the world of logic, the conclusion must stem directly and noticeably from the premise, which does not happen in this case. A premise is considered good or acceptable if the offered reasoning or evidence is credible and relevant. In this specific context, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other instead of creating a coherent sequence of events that allow to build the one situation from the other. So, without more information connecting these two scenarios, the conclusion (hypothesis) cannot be drawn from the provided premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the sentence \\"Man kayaking in a raging river.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" can be considered a true statement based on the sentence \\"Man kayaking in a raging river.\\" In the original sentence, \\"Man kayaking in a raging river,\\" it is implied that a man is maneuvering a kayak in a river that is described as raging, which presumably means it is a fast-flowing or intense river. The key information that the sentence provides about the man's location is that he is in a river. When the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" is analyzed, the proposition that \\"a man is on the river\\" falls within the scope of the activity described in the first sentence. That means, by virtue of his kayaking, the man can be said to be \\"on\\" the river, though it's not exactly specific on how he is on the river. While it's true that the sentences don't carry exactly the same implications (for example, the second sentence lacks the specificity about the man kayaking and the river being raging), there's still a broad overlap in what they convey. The activities contained within the second sentence are subset of the activities contained within the first sentence, and hence, the second statement could be seen as a general description of the first. So to conclude, despite the removal of specific details, the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" is a true sentence given the original sentence \\"Man kayaking in the raging river.\\" Its veracity stems from the fact that it refers to the same man and river, albeit in a less specific context. However, it is worth noting that while it is possible to infer the conditions of the second sentence based on the first, the reverse would not provide the same level of detailed understanding."},{"prompt":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What might you feel if you're meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time?

Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning? Anderson Township withdrew from Newtown in the 1960s by forming a paper township . In the 1960s , Newtown withdrew from Anderson Township by forming a paper city .","completion":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia might seem to convey the same message at first glance, they are actually expressing different ideas when examined more closely. Let's dissect each sentence to better understand the contextual differences. 1. \\"Anderson Township withdrew from Newtown in the 1960s by forming a paper township.\\" In this sentence, the implied meaning is that Anderson Township was originally a part of Newtown. At some point during the 1960s, Anderson Township decided it wanted to separate from Newtown and establish itself as a distinct entity. They accomplished this by creating and adopting the legal and administrative framework of a \\"paper township.\\" The phrase \\"paper township\\" suggests that the separation wasn't based on any physical or geographic changes but was rather a change in management and governance at the administrative level. 2. \\"In the 1960s, Newtown withdrew from Anderson Township by forming a paper city.\\" In this sentence, the implied meaning is that Newtown was originally either a part of or somehow connected to Anderson Township. To separate from Anderson Township, Newtown created a \\"paper city\\" during the 1960s. The phrase \\"paper city\\" indicates that the separation was also likely based on administrative or governance changes, rather than physical or geographic factors. In summary, the main difference between these two sentences is which entity is withdrawing from the other to establish its own independent governance. In the first sentence, Anderson Township is separating itself from Newtown, while in the second sentence, it is Newtown that is separating itself from Anderson Township. The process of separation is similar in both cases, as they both involve forming new legal and administrative entities, a \\"paper township\\" and a \\"paper city,\\" respectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the given pair of sentences. Usage: Sentence 1 is \\"4 kids sit on a ledge and converse.\\" Sentence 2 is \\"The girls are sitting on a concrete ledge.\\" This instruction refers to the initial understanding of the sentences. Here, Sentence 1 talks about four kids sitting on a ledge and talking while sentence 2 refers to unspecified girls on a concrete ledge. Part #2: Determine whether Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 agree or contradict each other. Usage: Sentence 1 and sentence 2 do not contradict, but they don't clearly agree either because Sentence 1 talks about four kids while Sentence 2 specifically talks about girls without specifying their number. This is why our job is to alter sentence 2. Part #3: Alter sentence 2 to make it clearly agree with sentence 1. Usage: An example altered Sentence 2 could be \\"The children are conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\" In this case, we alter 'girls' to 'children' to agree with 'kids' in sentence 1 and added them conversing to show what they are doing on the ledge according to sentence 1. Part #4: Ensure the generated sentences are short, with less than 15 words. Usage: In the above example, \\"The children are conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\", it meets the criteria since it only uses eight words which is less than fifteen. Part #5: New information can be introduced. Usage: Here, we have not introduced new information, but we could have. For example, we could say, \\"The children are happily conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\", which adds the new information that they are happy. Part #6: Avoid using pronouns to confuse the subject of the sentence. Usage: In the altered sentence, 'children' is used instead of any pronoun to avoid confusion about the subject. Using 'they' instead of 'children' could create ambiguity since it's not clear who 'they' refers to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore. They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore. They say they get the news on the television now. More people watch television news because it is easier and more interesting than reading a newspaper. What about you? Do you read news from a newspaper? Do you think it is easier to get the news from television? Or do you care about news at all? Would you mind if there were no news?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: On February 7, 1987, dozens of political prisoners were freed in the first group release since Khrushchev's \\"thaw\\" in the mid-1950s. On May 6, 1987, Pamyat, a Russian nationalist group, held an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow. The authorities did not break up the demonstration and even kept traffic out of the demonstrators' way while they marched to an impromptu meeting with Boris Yeltsin, head of the Moscow Communist Party and at the time one of Gorbachev's closest allies. On July 25, 1987, 300 Crimean Tatars staged a noisy demonstration near the Kremlin Wall for several hours, calling for the right to return to their homeland, from which they were deported in 1944; police and soldiers merely looked on. What is the answer to this question: Who released the prisoners in the 1950s?","completion":"The article does not provide information regarding who released the prisoners in the 1950s. However, the mention of Khrushchev's \\"thaw\\" provides a clue that the prisoners' release was likely associated with the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and during his tenure, he initiated a period known as the \\"Khrushchev Thaw.\\" This era marked a time of increased openness, transparency, and liberalization in the Soviet Union, which led to the relaxation of censorship, greater freedom of speech, and the release of political prisoners who had been imprisoned during Joseph Stalin's rule. Consequently, it can be inferred that the release of political prisoners in the 1950s was carried out under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev and his administration, as part of the broader reforms and liberalization measures during the \\"Khrushchev Thaw\\" period."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Where the Beat Meets the Street is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side - project , Bobby and the Midnites . The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 . - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \\"the rhythm devils\\". - Robert Hall \\"Bob\\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016. - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion. - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes. - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of The Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, The Other Ones changed their name to The Dead. - Deadhead or Dead Head is a name given to fans of the American psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\". - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - William \\"Bill\\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer. He played with the Grateful Dead for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy & the Kids. - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. - RatDog (sometimes known as The Ratdog Revue, Bob Weir & RatDog or Ratdog) is an American rock band. The group began as a side project for Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and bassist Rob Wasserman. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in December 1995 following the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9 of that year, RatDog became Bob Weir's primary band. The band performed until July, 2014. They performed Grateful Dead tunes primarily with a mixture of covers (including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry songs), along with some originals. RatDog's repertoire consisted of more than 150 songs. What is the relationship between 'where the beat meets the street' and 'columbia records'? Answer:","completion":"\\"Where the Beat Meets the Street\\" is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side project, Bobby and the Midnites. The relationship between this album and Columbia Records lies in the fact that John Mayer, who later collaborated with Bob Weir in Dead & Company, was signed to Columbia Records during the early stages of his career. John Mayer began working with former Grateful Dead members, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann, to form the band Dead & Company in 2015. Mayer, who gained recognition in the industry after signing with Columbia Records, brought his extensive guitar skills and love for the Grateful Dead's music into the new band. The formation of Dead & Company represents a kind of interconnected relationship between \\"Where the Beat Meets the Street\\" (a work of one of the Grateful Dead members) and Columbia Records (the label that helped propel John Mayer's career)."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Sentence 1: It is this. Sentence 2: This is what it is. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment is a relationship between two linguistic expressions such that the truth of one (e.g., Sentence 1) logically implies the truth of the other (e.g., Sentence 2). In this case, both sentences refer to the same thing and have an equivalent meaning, but they employ different syntactic structures. Sentence 1: \\"It is this.\\" In this sentence, the subject \\"It\\" is used to refer to an unspecified entity. The verb \\"is\\" links the subject to the predicate \\"this,\\" which represents the object or concept being discussed. This construction often follows an initial statement or question that establishes the topic, for instance: \\"Can you tell me about the book?\\" \\"It is this.\\" In this context, \\"It is this\\" affirms that the book is the specific object that is being referenced or discussed. Sentence 2: \\"This is what it is.\\" In this sentence, the subject \\"This\\" refers to the same object or concept as \\"It\\" in the first sentence. The verb \\"is\\" links the subject to the predicate \\"what it is,\\" which expresses the essence, nature, or identity of the subject. This construction is often used to emphasize the true nature or characteristics of an entity, as in: \\"I've discovered that this idea is revolutionary.\\" \\"This is what it is.\\" As with Sentence 1, the speaker is affirming the properties or nature of the subject in question. In both sentences, the speaker is essentially confirming and asserting something about the subject at hand. Even though the syntactic structures of the two sentences differ, the semantic content – the meaning and reference – remains the same. Therefore, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On the positive side, the app offers a decent emulation experience, allowing me to play a variety of DS games on my device. The control layout is also customizable, which has helped me find a comfortable setup for my device. However, the app suffers from some performance issues, which seem to vary depending on the specific game I've tried. Some games run relatively smoothly, while others exhibit noticeable lag and stuttering.

Question: \\"In what year did it become impossible for lay cardinals such as Teodolfo Mertel to exist?\\" Context: \\"At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The year in which it became impossible for lay cardinals, such as Teodolfo Mertel, to exist was 1917, when the Code of Canon Law was revised and promulgated by Pope Benedict XV. This change in the ecclesiastical law established new requirements for the appointment of cardinals, thus putting an end to the phenomenon of \\"lay cardinals.\\" Before the promulgation of the revised Code of Canon Law in 1917, cardinals could be appointed from among those who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but had not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. These individuals, despite being clerics, were inaccurately referred to as \\"lay cardinals\\" and were allowed to marry within the bounds of the ecclesiastical law. Teodolfo Mertel was one of the last cardinals belonging to this category, and his death in 1899 marked the end of an era in the College of Cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law reformed the requirements for the appointment of cardinals, stating that only those who had already been ordained as priests or bishops could be eligible for the cardinalate. By making this change, the Church aimed to ensure that all cardinals would possess the necessary ecclesiastical education and qualifications to carry out the specific functions assigned to them, which include advising the Pope, participating in the election of a new Pope, and governing the Church both on a local and universal level. Furthermore, since the time of Pope John XXIII in the late 1950s, it became a norm that a priest appointed as a cardinal must be consecrated as a bishop unless he obtains a dispensation from the Pope. This requirement further emphasized the importance of episcopal ordination in the cardinalate and ensured that cardinals are equipped to perform their essential roles within the Church hierarchy. In conclusion, it was in 1917 when the revision of the Code of Canon Law by Pope Benedict XV made it impossible for lay cardinals, such as Teodolfo Mertel, to exist. The new requirements for the appointment of cardinals not only brought an end to the phenomenon of \\"lay cardinals\\" but also strengthened the role of cardinals within the Church, offering better-prepared and more qualified individuals to carry out their vital responsibilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time? , can you please find it? Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on \\"Some Time\\" is Lennon. The text mentions \\"Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono...\\" and repeatedly refers to someone named Lennon prior to and after this statement. This person is John Lennon, a member of the Beatles, who was famously married to Yoko Ono. They often collaborated on music and art projects, and were both active in political activism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:Tahir Nazir, 40, obtained a fake university ID card and trawled the internet looking for student nights so he could target vulnerable young women. Fuelled by drink and drugs he followed and then attacked his victims, Manchester Crown Court heard. He was sentenced on Friday after being found guilty of a string of sex offences at his trial in March. The divorcee from Glasgow hired a car and embarked on a tour of university towns and cities in Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Oxford, Bristol and Cardiff. The court heard an examination of Nazir's mobile phone found he had conducted internet searches for \\"high school girls\\" and \\"freshers'\\" week, particularly around Swansea and Cardiff. In the early hours of 22 September a visitor to a shared house in the Cathays student neighbourhood of Cardiff awoke to find Nazir on top of her \\"very drunk\\" friend. CCTV showed Nazir prowling the corridors of student flats trying doors in an attempt to find victims. Other images showed him following a student into a building. He was caught after sneaking into a student house in Fallowfield, Manchester, last November. Several female undergraduates heard someone systematically going through the house, trying their locked bedroom door handles. They called police who arrested him nearby. Analysis of DNA linked him to a sex attack five days earlier at a block of flats in Hulme. He was convicted of trespass with intent to commit an offence, sexual assault, attempted rape, and three charges of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence. Judge Martin Steiger QC said: \\"His campaign involved taking detailed photos of premises where students lived, in particular entrances and access rooms. \\"And finally it involved his posing as a student for which purpose he had obtained a highly convincing fake student union ID card.\\" He said he preyed on \\"drunken students hoping no doubt that they would not remember or would not complain about his conduct\\". Nazir wrote a letter to the judge in which he \\"apologised to the victims and acknowledged the seriousness of his crimes\\", according to his barrister Richard Littler. After the hearing, Det Insp Ian Bourne, from South Wales Police, called Nazir a \\"predatory offender\\". He said: \\"South Wales Police takes all reports of sexual violence extremely seriously and a detailed forensic search of the house resulted in a DNA profile being obtained. \\"This was only identified as Nazir's when, less than two months later, he brazenly committed a strikingly similar crime in Manchester. \\"We would like to commend the courage of the victim and her housemates who all gave evidence at the trial at Manchester Crown Court. \\"We would also like to thank the other witnesses who played a crucial role in assisting us in bringing this dangerous individual to justice.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Tahir Nazir, a 40-year-old man, has been sentenced for a string of sex offences targeting vulnerable young women in various university towns and cities across the UK. Nazir used a fake university ID card to pose as a student and searched the internet for student events to find potential victims. He was eventually caught in Manchester after several female students alerted the police of his suspicious behavior. Following his arrest, DNA analysis linked him to a previous sex attack. Nazir was convicted of multiple charges, including trespass with intent to commit an offence, sexual assault, attempted rape, and three counts of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Is the Caribbean the homeland of both Jean Rhys and Adolfo Bioy Casares? Answer:","completion":"Jean Rhys and Adolfo Bioy Casares are notable figures in world literature, each hailing from distinct regions of the world with the Caribbean only being the homeland of one of them. Jean Rhys, originally named Ella Gwendolyn Rees Williams, was indeed born in the Caribbean. She was born on August 24, 1890, in Roseau, the capital city of Dominica, an island nation in the West Indies. Part of the larger group of Caribbean islands, Dominica has rich cultural influences from the Caribbean indigenous people, Africa, and Europe that are reflective in Rhys' works. She is perhaps best known for her novel \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" which is set in Jamaica and Dominica during the 1830s and provides a feminist and anti-colonial response to Charlotte Bronte’s \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Rhys' upbringing in the Caribbean played a significant role in her writing, with her stories often exploring issues such as identity, alienation, and the struggles experienced by women in society - themes that possibly stemmed from her own experiences in Dominica. Her novels, though praised mostly in the latter part of the 20th century, helped shape global perceptions of the rich and complex Caribbean culture and society. Conversely, Adolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, far removed geographically and culturally from the Caribbean. Bioy Casares is a central figure in Argentine literature, well known as a writer and intellectual. He was a collaborator and close friend of Jorge Luis Borges, with their co-authorship producing several classics in Argentine, Latin American, and global literature. One of his most renowned works is \\"The Invention of Morel,\\" a reflection of his interest in immortality, a theme seen throughout his literary pieces. Argentina, specifically Buenos Aires, with its unique fusion of European and Latin American cultures, deeply influenced Bioy Casares' writing. His work often centered on the issues of reality and illusion, concepts that stretch beyond geographical and cultural bounds. In conclusion, the Caribbean is the homeland of Jean Rhys, from where she derived substantial thematic content for her writing. However, the same cannot be said of Adolfo Bioy Casares, who was not from the Caribbean region but from Buenos Aires, Argentina. His upbringing and cultural experiences there significantly influenced his literary contributions. Despite the geographical and cultural differences in their origins, both authors have made indelible marks on literature, with their works continuing to be celebrated and studied globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Biodiversity is the variety of living organisms that make up an ecosystem. It includes all the plants, animals, and microorganisms that live together in an environment.","completion":"Helping the forest preserve its diversity is a crucial task in ensuring the health and balance of ecosystems. It strengthens ecosystems, enhancing their resilience and resistance against disturbances such as natural disasters, pests, and diseases. In doing so, biodiversity plays a vital role in supporting human life, providing essential resources like food, medicines, and oxygen, as well as maintaining the Earth's life support systems such as climate regulation, water purification, and nutrient cycling. To contribute to preserving the forest's diversity, several strategies and best practices can be adopted at various levels from individual involvement to collaborative enterprises. Here's a breakdown of the most effective approaches: 1. Public awareness and education: Educate yourself and others about the importance of biodiversity and how human activities can adversely affect it. Encourage community involvement in conserving and regenerating natural habitats. 2. Support sustainable forestry practices: Promote environmentally responsible woodland management and sustainable logging practices. Advocate for certified timber products and paper that come from well-managed forests. 3. Protect and restore habitats: Support the establishment of protected areas like national parks and wildlife reserves where natural habitats can be conserved. Participate in restoration projects to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems and reintroduce native species. 4. Invasive species control: Help prevent the spread of invasive species in forests by learning about the impacts of these species and supporting efforts to control or eradicate them. Invasive species can outcompete native species for resources and alter the ecosystem functions. 5. Encourage responsible recreation: Help protect forests by practicing responsible recreational activities such as hiking, camping, and birdwatching. Use existing trails, minimize waste, and avoid disturbing wildlife habitats. 6. Support local communities: Assist local communities that rely on forests for their livelihoods in adopting sustainable practices like agroforestry, non-timber forest products, and ecotourism opportunities. 7. Engage in collaboration and partnerships: Collaborate with environmental organizations, governmental agencies, research institutions, and local communities to implement conservation initiatives, monitor biodiversity, and enforce policies. 8. Foster scientific research: Support scientific research aimed at better understanding forest ecosystems and the dynamics of biodiversity. This research can be invaluable in identifying new species, understanding the relationships between species, and developing effective conservation strategies. 9. Advocate for strong environmental policies: Engage in environmental advocacy urging governments and policymakers to adopt and enforce strict environmental regulations that protect forests and their biodiversity. 10. Financial and technical assistance: Contribute to conservation efforts financially or by providing expertise in relevant fields such as ecology, forestry, wildlife management, and environmental policy. Each individual's involvement, either through direct action or by advocating for responsible practices, contributes to the preservation of forest diversity. By taking these steps, we will not only be ensuring the health of our ecosystems but also securing the quality of life for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If a catholic had a civil marriage with a non catholic, can she now marry a catholic in church without getting a civil divorce? Can a Maronite Catholic marry a civil divorced non catholic single mother? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same information but are related to Catholic marriages and rules about marrying someone who has been in a previous marriage. 1. A Catholic who had a civil marriage with a non-Catholic might not be considered as valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church if they didn't get permission from the Church. In this case, she might be able to marry a Catholic in the Church without getting a civil divorce. However, if her previous marriage is considered valid by the Church, then she will need to get a civil divorce and an annulment, which means that the Church investigates and declares the previous marriage was never valid. 2. A Maronite Catholic, who is also part of the Catholic Church with some different traditions, can marry a civil divorced non-Catholic single mother as long as the Church grants permission.

Information: - Wallace Markfield (August 12, 1926 May 24, 2002) was an American comic novelist best known for his first novel, \\"To an Early Grave\\" (1964), about four men who spend the day driving across Brooklyn to their friend's funeral. He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\". - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television . - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\". - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979. - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\". - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\".

Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.

Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic. - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg. When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.

What is the name of the dad who said, \\"What's this?\\" to which Julian replied, \\"it's Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed...

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Betty has always been proactive when it comes to taking care of her health and well-being. She was always a firm believer in prevention being better than cure and saw the value in regularly consulting with medical professionals to ensure that she was in the best possible health. On the other hand, Natalie never had a significant interest in attending checkups or consulting with doctors. She often found herself feeling uneasy about the whole process, questioning the utility of such visits, and wondering if the cost and time spent were worth it. The two friends had often discussed their differing perspectives on the matter. Betty would explain the comfort and reassurance that came with knowing a medical expert was tracking her health, helping her to catch any potential issues early on, and providing guidance on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. She felt that her regular checkups were a critical component of her self-care routine and appreciated the peace of mind that they provided. Meanwhile, Natalie would counter by arguing that she believed in trusting her own instincts and did not like the idea of placing her health in someone else's hands. She felt that she knew her body better than anyone else and could sense when something was wrong, relying on her intuition to guide her when making decisions about her health. While Natalie appreciated Betty's perspective, she couldn't help but feel skeptical about whether regular doctor visits and consultations were truly helping Betty or just creating a false sense of security. Despite their contrasting views on the matter, the two friends still managed to maintain a deep bond and respect for each other's personal choices. They both recognized the importance of staying true to their ideals and making independent decisions that aligned with their own needs and desires. In the end, Betty continued attending her doctor's appointments, both out of habit and genuine appreciation for the advice and guidance that medical professionals provided. She was aware of the latest information about health issues and concerns, which made her feel confident about her choices and allowed her to stay ahead of any potential problems. This proactive approach to health helped her forge a lifestyle that suited her interests while giving her the sense of security and control she desired. On the other hand, Natalie maintained her independence and continued to listen to her body and trusted in her own ability to discern her health-related needs. She remained cautious and attentive, making lifestyle adjustments and seeking medical guidance whenever she deemed it necessary. While her approach differed from Betty's, it was the one that resonated more profoundly with her values and beliefs. Both women genuinely believed that their approach to healthcare was the right one.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A. To compare it with a well-known matter he selected water. He labeled it as matter B. He also selected ice, which he labeled as matter C. He is now better prepared to compare their states. But I can use this background: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. What is an answer for this question: Which would have higher density, matter B or matter C? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Matter B, which is water in its liquid state, would have a higher density than Matter C, which is ice. The reason for this difference in density lies primarily in the hydrogen bonding present in water molecules. In the liquid state (Matter B), water molecules are closely packed and constantly moving, forming and breaking hydrogen bonds. This results in a denser arrangement of molecules. When water freezes into ice (Matter C), the hydrogen bonds between water molecules become more stable and form an open, hexagonal lattice structure. This structure leads to an increase in the distance between water molecules, causing the overall volume to increase while the mass remains the same. As a result, the density (mass/volume) of the ice decreases, making it less dense than liquid water. This property of water is unique and essential for the survival of aquatic life in cold climates. The lower density of ice allows it to float on liquid water, creating an insulating barrier that helps to protect and maintain the temperature of the water beneath it. This enables organisms like fish to survive even when the surface of a lake or pond freezes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product, pointing out its inadequacies and limitations. In particular, they highlight the product's misleading claim that it \\"works on most cellular phones\\" when, in actuality, it only functions with a limited number of cell phone makes. Additionally, the review emphasizes how the product is geographically restricted to a small number of countries, which is a significant drawback for users who expect broad compatibility and functionality. The reviewer's negative experience was further confirmed by the fact they removed the software within a mere five minutes of installation.

Our special seasonal Noosa Pumpkin yoghurt is a “hats off” to this beaut of a traditional dessert. Natural pumpkin puree, warm, rich spices, and our famously thick and velvety yoghurt—it’s a sweet, spicy holiday shindig for your tastebuds. ||||| Chicago, September 22, 2015 — It’s that time a year again for falling leaves, football games, and the annual tradition of limited-time offer (LTO) pumpkin specialty drinks. Turns out that it’s one of the favorite times of the year for foodservice operators who offer the limited time drinks because their business benefits in more ways than one, reports The NPD Group, a leading global information company. The seasonal beverage offers can spur additional purchases by established customers, bring in new customers, draw customers from competitors, and stimulate business during slow periods, according to research from NPD’s Checkout Tracking™, which harvests receipts from more than 35,000 diners to track consumer purchase behavior. An analysis of the purchase cycle of pumpkin spice latte buyers reveals that these lattes are likely considered to be an “indulgent�? purchase, and the vast majority of these purchasers, 72 percent, did so just once. About 20 percent of pumpkin spice latte customers purchased the item twice, and about 8 percent made three or more purchases during the offer period. In addition to increasing visits and visit frequency, seasonal beverages also produce higher checks, NPD found. During fall and winter 2014, the average check for pumpkin latte buyers was 7.81, compared with 6.67 for non-buyers. Similarly, the average check for buyers of a white mocha, another popular seasonal beverage, was 8.37, compared with just 6.84 for non-buyers. Consumers’ purchase of food items in addition to the beverage contributed to the higher check average, according to the Checkout Tracking analysis. To determine the impact of limited-time offers on visit frequency, NPD also examined the purchase cycle of a seasonal shake offer at another major chain. The data revealed that these shake purchasers tended to be the restaurant’s most loyal customers, with higher purchase frequency rates, especially during the promotional period. Shake buyers made 5.7 visits in the two-month period before the limited-time offer, and then made an additional visit during the limited-time offer period. Meanwhile non-shake buyers made only 4.7 visits prior to the promotion and 4.4 visits during the limited-time offer. “Considering the battle for traffic share in the restaurant industry, it’s critical to offer unique, craveable menu items that attract both new customers and keep current ones coming back,�? says Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst. “For the restaurant operator, seasonal beverages have a positive impact on visit frequency and check averages as consumers tend to purchase food along with the seasonal beverage. It doesn’t get much better than that.�?

Available options: (i). see the view. (ii). go to sleep. (iii). looked out the window for the flight. The answer is:","completion":"Aubrey chose to sit by the window in the airplane so they could look out the window. Based on the available information, we can analyze the possible reasons behind Aubrey's decision. (i). See the view: One of the most likely reasons for Aubrey's choice of a window seat is to enjoy the view outside the airplane. Many travelers prefer window seats to marvel at the vast expanses of the sky, the clouds, and the Earth from above. This unique perspective offers passengers a visual treat, allowing them to witness breathtaking sceneries, sunrises, and sunsets that can only be experienced from high altitudes. Additionally, observing the ground below while taking off and landing is a thrilling experience for many. (ii). Go to sleep: Although going to sleep might not be the primary motive for Aubrey to sit by the window, it could be a secondary consideration. A window seat in an airplane provides passengers with some extra space to lean against, offering them greater comfort when trying to sleep on a flight, especially during long-haul journeys. Furthermore, a window seat also minimizes the number of times Aubrey may be disturbed by other passengers who need to access the aisle for walking or restroom breaks. (iii). Looked out the window for the flight: This option is likely a restatement of the main context. Since Aubrey wanted to sit by the window so they could look out, it is implied that they wanted to gaze out during the flight, which could include seeing the view and simply enjoying the visual stimulus of observing the surroundings. Based on the context provided and the available options, the answer is most likely: (i) see the view. This reason not only aligns with the context that Aubrey wanted to look out the window during the flight, but it also provides a specific and substantial reason why passengers enjoy window seats in an airplane, which is to take in the stunning views from thousands of feet above the ground."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Edwin Washington Edwards (born August 7, 1927) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 7th congressional district from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th Governor of Louisiana for four terms (1972-1980, 1984-1988 and 1992-1996), twice as many elected terms as any other Louisiana chief executive. He served a total of 16 years in office, the sixth-longest serving gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days. A colorful, powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who has been dubbed the \\"very last of the line of New Deal Southern Democrats\\", was long dogged by charges of corruption. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering charges and sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. Both in his political rhetoric and in his public persona, Edwards cast himself as a Louisiana populist in the tradition of Huey P. Long and Earl K. Long. He was inaugurated as governor on May 9. One of his first acts was to call for a constitutional convention to overhaul Louisiana's bulky charter. Many of the sections on state government were written by delegate Robert G. Pugh, a prominent Shreveport attorney, who became an advisor to Edwards and two other governors thereafter. Voters approved the new constitution by a three-to-two margin in 1974, and government reorganization resulted. For the first time Louisiana operated with a \\"cabinet style\\" executive department in lieu of the hundreds of boards and commissions that had existed for decades, each its own fiefdom. During his first two terms in office, Edwards developed a reputation for being one of the most colorful and flamboyant politicians in the history of a state known for its unorthodox political figures. Charismatic, well-dressed, and quick with clever one-liners and retorts, Edwards maintained wide popularity. On taking office, Edwards hired J. Kelly Nix as his executive assistant and in 1974 elevated him to first executive assistant. In the second term, however, Nix left the administration to take office as the Louisiana state school superintendent. Dale Thorn, who had been Edwards' press secretary while he was in Congress, continued in that position for the first and most of the second Edwards terms. He was later associate commissioner of higher education for the Louisiana Board of Regents, and an LSU journalism professor. Edwards also depended heavily on state Senator Sixty Rayburn of Bogalusa, whose 44-year service earned him the sobriquet as \\"Dean of the Louisiana Senate.\\" He also rewarded political friends, such as former legislative colleague Fred L. Schiele, whom he appointed in 1973 to succeed the embattled Noah W. Cross as sheriff of Concordia Parish in eastern Louisiana. Under Edwards, Michael H. O'Keefe of New Orleans in 1976 was named president of the state Senate, an office that was held by the lieutenant governor prior to the implementation of the state Constitution of 1974. In 1983, as Edwards prepared to return to office, O'Keefe was engulfed in scandal and forced to leave the Senate. He was as replaced by the Edwards loyalist, Samuel B. Nunez Jr., of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish. In 2013, O'Keefe was still serving time in prison for a 1999 conviction. Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that \\"It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.\\" He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called \\"One Edwards Square\\" (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas. Later, Edwards' commissioner of administration Charles Roemer - father of future governor Buddy Roemer - was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case. During the governor's first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named Clyde Vidrine made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine's credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called Just Takin' Orders, which included salacious details of Edwards' frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife. In a 1976 scandal known as Koreagate, it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. South Korean rice broker Tongsun Park was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing 10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was \\"super moralistic\\" for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards's former congressional colleague Otto Passman of Monroe, who was later acquitted of all charges in the case. Edwards was the issue of the campaign. Because of his name recognition, his resilient supporters, and unmatched political skill, even a weakened Edwards could safely assume he would win a place in Louisiana's unique primary election system runoff. The question was whether his opponent in the runoff would be someone who could beat him. There was a prevailing sense in the race that Edwards needed Livingston in the runoff. Livingston was a Republican in a state that had at that point elected only one Republican governor since Reconstruction. And Livingston was widely perceived as lacking in charisma and personality, which would work to Edwards's advantage. Any other opponent, a moderate Democrat without the ethical problems, would be dangerous. To that end, Edwards talked up Livingston. Perhaps the key moment in the 1987 race came at a forum between the candidates. As usual, the main topic of discussion was Edwin Edwards. His challengers were asked, in succession, if they would consider endorsing Edwards in the general election if they did not make it to the runoff. The candidates hedged, particularly Secretary of State Brown, a reliable Edwards supporter in the state Senate who in his 1979 election drew many of the same voters who supported fellow Democrat Louis Lambert in his failed gubernatorial bid in the same general election vs. Treen. The last candidate to speak was Buddy Roemer: \\"No, we've got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards.\\" The next day, as political commentator John Maginnis put it, Jim Brown was explaining his statement while Buddy Roemer was ordering \\"Slay the Dragon\\" buttons. Boosted by his endorsement as the 'good government candidate' by nearly every newspaper in the state, Roemer stormed from last place in the polls and on election night, overtook Edwin Edwards and placed first in the primary election, with 33 percent of the vote compared with Edwards' 28 percent. This marked the first time Edwin Edwards ever finished other than in first place in an election. In what seemed to be the end of Edwards' political career, the governor withdrew from the contest in his concession speech, automatically electing Buddy Roemer governor. In fact, he was cleverly setting a trap for Roemer. By withdrawing, Edwards denied Roemer the opportunity to build a governing coalition in the general election race, and denied him the decisive majority victory that he surely would have attained. In one stroke, Edwards made Buddy Roemer a minority governor. Also, Edwards virtually ceded control of the state to Roemer even before his inauguration. By doing so, he passed on the burden of the state's problems to the new governor, who was essentially under the gun even before assuming office. For four years, Roemer struggled to be a reform governor of Louisiana as so many had before him. And although virtually no one realized it at the time, Edwin Edwards quietly waited in the wings for a return to power.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the important of anyone but Edwards?","completion":"The importance of \\"anyone but Edwards\\" was that it showed a strong desire for change and for a candidate who was not associated with the corruption and scandals that had plagued Edwin Edwards' time in office. Buddy Roemer's statement, \\"No, we've got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards,\\" demonstrated his commitment to breaking away from the old ways of Louisiana politics and bringing about reform. This stance resonated with voters, helping Roemer gain momentum and eventually win the election."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The translated English version of \\"Gaz précurseurs dont on sait qu'ils causent la formation d'aérosols organiques secondaires.\\" is \\"Precursor gases that are known to cause the formation of secondary organic aerosols.\\" Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are formed in the atmosphere through complex reaction pathways involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight. These aerosols are a component of particulate matter, sometimes covering a significant fraction, and have implications for global climate as well as human health. In simple terms, SOAs are tiny particles that float in the air and are composed of organic molecules. Natural processes, like plant emissions, contribute to the formation of SOAs, but human activities, such as burning of fossil fuels and industrial emissions, are also significant sources. Precursors to these SOAs are typically 'gaseous' organic compounds, which are transformed into aerosols by oxidative processes driven by sunlight, with the help of other compounds in the atmosphere. Different volatile organic compounds can become precursors for SOA formation depending largely on their volatility and their reactivity in the atmosphere. Common VOCs that are known to yield SOAs include isoprene (emitted from trees), monoterpenes (also from trees), and aromatics (from human activities). The term 'precursor gases' refers to these volatile organic compounds that can undergo chemical reactions, leading to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. The process begins when these gaseous compounds are released into the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, these gases can be oxidized by common atmospheric oxidants, these gaseous precursors undergo a series of chemical transformations driven by solar radiation, causing reactant VOC molecules to cluster together and condense, forming aerosols. These aerosols play a key role in the Earth's radiation balance because they can scatter and absorb solar radiation as well as act as the condensation nuclei for cloud droplets. For these reasons, understanding the nature of these precursor gases and the formation of secondary organic aerosols is necessary for scientists trying to understand climate change and air quality issues."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: The input is a tweet which can be classified as Hate Speech, Offensive or Normal.

Write a summary based on this article: Syrians in Jordan are taking an interest in attending sports clubs to learn to swim as they prepare to undertake the journey to seek refuge by sea. “Sharif,” the owner of a sports venue, has noticed high demand among many Syrian refugees for attending the clubs, with their activities limited to taking swimming lessons. After speaking with some of them, he learned the reason was that some of them wanted to try to immigrate by sea. “Usually we close the pool during winter, but considering that so many have registered for swimming lessons, and that most of them are Syrian refugees, we kept the classes open,” Sharif said. The owner of a private pool, who asked that his name not be published, said: “We receive the men in one period and the women in another period. Since I’m in charge of registering participants in the swimming courses, I noticed that entire families were signing up. The father would come with the sons, and the mother would come with the daughters. We also had a few elderly people.” An official in another sports club said the issue had not drawn his attention at first, and he did not think about why there was such high demand among refugees registering for swimming lessons. But after speaking with them, it became clear to him that they were trying to plan their journey by sea to seek refuge abroad. One refugee did not deny his intent to travel by sea, or that he was trying to learn to swim to try to reduce the risks of the journey, despite knowing that simply learning to swim would not save him if the boat were to sink. The young man, Mohammed, said: “It never occurred to me that one day I might think of putting my life in danger, but two reasons encouraged me to take this step. First, many have survived, and second, the life I live now is like death, because it has no future.” This article was translated and edited by The Syrian Observer. Responsibility for the information and views set out in this article lies entirely with the author. ||||| --- Swimming pools and sports centres in Jordan are seeing an increase in demand for lessons as Syrian refugees prepare to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing to Europe. The Syrian Observer, a website which gathers and translates language news from several sides of the conflict, says that anti-government outlet Al-Madar al-Youm reports that one sports centre owner, Sharif, said he noticed the surge in interest and after talking to customers realised it was because some people were planning on trying to get to Europe by sea. More than 300,000 people are thought to have relied on the mercy of people smugglers, unseaworthy vessels and good weather to arrive on beaches in Turkey and Greece in 2015 alone. At least 6,000 people are estimated to have died making the crossing since the beginning of 2014. More than 400 people have died so far in 2016. Sharif told Al-Madar al-Youm: Usually we close the pool during winter, but considering that so many have registered for swimming lessons, and that most of them are Syrian refugees, we kept the classes open. Another pool owner said that entire families are signing up for lessons, with mothers taking daughters and fathers taking sons to segregated lessons. Some elderly people have also been learning. A young man called Mohammed the group spoke to said he knew that if a boat sank, learning to swim would not be enough to save him. It never occurred to me that one day I might think of putting my life in danger, but two reasons encouraged me to take this step.

More than 300,000 refugees and migrants have used the dangerous sea route across the Mediterranean so far this year. © UNHCR/A. McConnell GENEVA, Aug 28 (UNHCR) - More than 300,000 refugees and migrants have used the dangerous sea route across the Mediterranean so far this year with almost 200,000 of them landing in Greece and a further 110,000 in Italy. The UN refugee agency, revealing the latest statistics in Geneva on Friday, said this represents a large increase from last year, when around 219,000 people crossed the Mediterranean during the whole of 2014. \\"At the same time, some 2,500 refugees and migrants are estimated to have died or gone missing this year, trying to reach Europe. This death toll does not include yesterday's tragedy off Libya where numbers of deaths are still unconfirmed,\\" UNHCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming told a press briefing in Geneva. Last year some 3,500 people died or were reported missing in the Mediterranean Sea. Fleming said that despite the concerted efforts of the joint European search and rescue operation under FRONTEX, which has saved tens of thousands of lives this year, the Mediterranean Sea continues to be the \\"deadliest route for refugees and migrants\\". She added that in the last few days, even more people had lost their lives in three separate incidents. The Libyan Coast Guard carried two rescue operations on Thursday morning, seven miles off the port town of Zwara. Two boats carrying an approximate total of 500 refugees and migrants were intercepted and survivors taken to shore in Libya. \\"An estimated 200 people are still missing and feared dead. A still undetermined number of bodies were recovered and taken to shore. The Libyan Red Crescent has been helping with the collection of the bodies,\\" Fleming added. On Wednesday (26 August), rescuers coming to the aid of another boat off the Libyan coast found 51 people dead from suffocation in the hold. \\"According to survivors, smugglers were charging people money for allowing them to come out of the hold in order to breathe,\\" Fleming detailed. She quoted one survivor, Abdel, 25, from Sudan as saying: \\"We didn't want to go down there but they beat us with sticks to force us. We had no air so we were trying to get back up through the hatch and to breathe through the cracks in the ceiling. But the other passengers were scared the boat would capsize so they pushed us back down and beat us too. Some were stamping on our hands.\\" Fleming said that last week (15 August), the bodies of 49 persons were found in the hold of another boat in a similar but separate incident. They are thought to have died after inhaling poisonous fumes. Also that week, a rubber dinghy carrying some 145 refugees and migrants ran into trouble when the person steering it made a manoeuvre that caused the dinghy to tilt dangerously to one side. \\"Some people fell into the sea and two men jumped into the water to rescue them. Panic ensued and people began to jostle and shove and, as a result, three women were crushed to death on the dinghy,\\" Fleming said. Of those who fell in the water, 18 are still missing and believed to have drowned. The survivors were rescued and taken to Lampedusa, including a two-month old baby of one of the women who died. Most of the survivors are reported to be in a critical condition, suffering from shock, cuts and bruises. Many of the people arriving by sea in southern Europe, particularly in Greece, come from countries affected by violence and conflict, such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan; they are in need of international protection and they are often physically exhausted and psychologically traumatized. UNHCR appeals to all governments involved to provide comprehensive responses and act with humanity and in accordance with their international obligations. All European countries and the EU must act together in response to the growing emergency and demonstrate responsibility and solidarity.

Movie title: Ferdinand the Bull Movie plot: In the beginning, there are a lot of bulls, romping around together and butting their heads. There was only one bull who wasn't doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange-looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bullfight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out banderilleros, picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The banderilleros and picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff because Ferdinand was so big and strong. But Ferdinand looked up in the stands and saw all of the beautiful hats that the women were wearing, each decorated with lovely, fragrant flowers. He couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful hats. The matador was very angry that Ferdinand wasn't charging at him. But Ferdinand was not interested in fighting; he was only interested in admiring the beautiful flowers....

The Iberians (Latin: Hiberi, from Greek: Iberes, Iberes) were a set of peoples that Greek and Roman sources (among others, Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienus, Herodotus and Strabo) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula, at least from the 6th century BC. The Roman sources also use the term Hispani to refer to the Iberians. The term Iberian, as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans). The Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region. The Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity \\"Betatun\\" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a \\"horse taming god\\" or \\"lord of the horses\\" (despotes hippon). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions. Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the \\"Bastetania dance\\" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common. The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs. Iberians venerated the war god Cariociecus. What other interesting things can you tell me?","completion":"The Iberians, a diverse set of pre-Roman peoples, had rich and varied cultural aspects that make their history quite fascinating. Some additional interesting features of the Iberian culture include: 1. Language and Writing System: The Iberians spoke a variety of languages, which were part of the larger Iberian languages group. Their writing system, called Iberian script, was primarily used in the eastern and southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. There were two main variants of the Iberian script: Northeastern Iberian and Southeastern Iberian scripts. The Iberian scripts remain partially undeciphered, although some progress has been made in understanding their content. 2. Trade and Economy: Iberians had a flourishing trade economy, especially along the coastal regions where they interacted with Greeks, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians. They exchanged locally produced goods like metals, wine, and textiles for goods from other cultures. Iberians were skilled workers in metalworking, pottery, and textiles and were known for their silver and iron ore mining. 3. Political Structure: The Iberians had a tribal-based political organization, with each tribe having its own central settlement known as an oppidum. The oppida functioned as a fortified city or town that housed the ruling elites, religious sites, and key workshops. The Iberians had both monarchy and aristocratic ruling systems. 4. Warfare and Military: The Iberians were prominent warriors known for their courage and ferocity in battles. They employed various types of weapons such as the falcata, a curved sword, and long-range weapons like the soliferrum, a heavy throwing spear. The Iberians were historically recorded for their military prowess and defensive strategies. For example, during the Second Punic War (218 – 201 BC), the Iberians fought both alongside and against Carthaginians and Romans. 5. Art and Music: Iberian art was characterized by a fusion of local elements and influences from external sources such as Greeks, Phoenicians, and Celts. Iberian art, mainly seen in pottery, sculptures, and cave paintings provide valuable insights into their rituals, daily lives, and religious beliefs. Music and dance was an important aspect of their religious and daily life, as evidenced by paintings and sculptures depicting musicians and dancers. Iberians also produced various musical instruments, including different types of flutes and lyres. Studying the Iberians helps us understand a crucial era of human history that contributed to the development of modern European societies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education.

Unlike the system during the Ancien Régime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Pseudolabrus is a genus of wrasses native to the eastern Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.

Write highlights for this article: The resilience of a burned baby golden eagle that survived a Utah wildfire is astounding wildlife rehabilitators nursing him back to health. \\"The trauma and the injury and the situation he is in -- to come out of it is amazing,\\" said DaLyn Erickson, executive director of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah in Ogden. All of the eaglet's feathers, even on his head, were charred. He also suffered burns to the feet and around his beak. His improbable story began June 1, when a volunteer who documents eagles placed a band on the bird. The Dump Fire erupted three weeks later, burning more than 5,500 acres south of Salt Lake City and west of Utah Lake. Kent Keller returned in late June to the nest, built on the edge of the cliff, thinking he would recover the band from a deceased animal. The nest on Lake Mountain was gone, the rocks behind it blackened by the blaze. Keller then spotted legs and talons near a scorched juniper below. Amazingly, the baby eagle was alive. Near him were rabbit and squirrel carcasses, evidence his parents had tried to feed him after disaster struck. Fortunately, his eyes had not been burned. Wildfire victims face second tragedy. Keller said he has thought of the horror the helpless nestling might have felt when flames approached. \\"He had enough courage to jump from that nest and try to save himself anyway,\\" said Keller, 56, who describes himself as an amateur ornithologist. \\"He is a real fighter.\\" The fall was about 25 feet, and the eagle probably walked back to the base of the cliff after rolling another 100 feet, said Keller. The bird remained in the area for several days while Keller, who is authorized to band raptors, sought permission from federal and state authorities to obtain care for him. On Wednesday, Keller handed the bird over to Erickson. She and her staff dubbed the survivor \\"Phoenix\\" -- a reference to the mythical creature that is reborn from the ashes. There was no food in the craw of the dehydrated eagle, which weighed just over 5 pounds. \\"He was lethargic and just obviously hurting,\\" Erickson told CNN on Saturday. \\"After we got him hydrated and medications, he perked up and that fire came back in him.\\" Erickson said Phoenix, now about 70 days old, was a handful Saturday, lunging and using his talons as caregivers fed and provided antibiotics to the animal. \\"He's not grateful,\\" she quipped. Rehabilitators limit their contact with the eagle so that he will not \\"habituate,\\" or become too comfortable around people. They use hydrotherapy to help the healing in his feet. \\"He needs those for hunting. There are lots of tendons and muscles we need to protect,\\" said Erickson. Golden eagles, which are protected, typically eat reptiles, birds and small mammals, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They also are known to scavenge carrion. Colorado's most destructive fire nears containment. Keller said golden eagle females are slightly smaller than the more-famous bald eagle and tend to hunt more and scavenge less. Their particular favorite prey in northern Utah is the black-tailed jackrabbit. The resident of suburban Salt Lake City studies golden eagles and provides population information to state wildlife authorities. Erickson called Keller \\"the hero in this story.\\" It's too early to tell whether Phoenix will be able to fly in the wild. Rehabilitation will take at least a year and his feathers won't fully molt until mid-2013. \\"We are fairly confident, but there could be follicle damage we do not know about that would prevent feathers from coming in,\\" Erickson said. The nonprofit center, which treats about 1,800 animals a year, is accepting financial and food donations to offset the cost of caring for the golden eagle. \\"He is doing well and we are very positive about his outcome right now,\\" said Erickson. \\"(But) these types of things can turn at any moment.\\" How to donate.

George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.

The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100.

When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

This will typically be a separate track in your software. Depending on how fast or slow you want the song to be, the speed of the click can be divided into halves, thirds, or quarters. You can experiment if you’re unsure. The click track will help to ensure that with all of the copy and pasting you’ll do, the song stays on tempo. Your tempo will vary according to the mood and style of the song, and is typically between 80 and 120. More likely than not, you'll turn the click track off once you have a basic beat made -- this is just a guide right now to keep you on tempo. The drums are your backbone, providing the structure that all other instruments fall on. They usually come first. That said, you don't have to use drums for percussion -- gunshots, car doors slamming, synth blasts, pots and pans, and much more have been used to provide rhythm in songs of all genres. Hip-hop beats have a classic trio -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. That's it. Check out DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena for a classic example. You can download drum packs, which are recordings of different percussion sounds, to use in your songs for free online. Search the drums you want on a search engine, like \\"Steel Drum Sounds Pack,\\" or \\"Led Zeppelin Drum Sample Pack.\\" Together, the bass and drums form the rhythm section of every song. While the drums set the tempo and beat, the bass locks into this rhythm and hints at the melody, often with simple, danceable lines. There are many songs that are almost all drums and bass -- so don't disregard the bass because it is harder to hear in the final mix -- it's the instrument that gets people dancing. Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \\"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\\" or complex, like Common's \\"Be (Intro).\\" A bass line doesn't need a bass guitar, though they help. Listen to what Daft Punk is able to do with deep synthesizers for another example. Your bass line and kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) should mesh for the maximum effect. Most producers like to have them alternating. The bass and the drums should be unique to make your song unique. Still, the melody line is where most songs come to their own and become new, big beats. Build melodies around your mood, using synths and electronic sounds for EDM or techno music, horns and guitars for R&B, even odd \\"found sounds\\" from weird sources (see \\"Windows Media Player\\" by Charles Hamilton for an example). The possibilities are endless. Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. Looping is taking at least one bar of music, like a drum line, and repeating it flawlessly so it sounds like the drummer is playing the exact same thing the whole song. You can, and should, loop everything -- making the perfect smaller section and then dragging it out to save time and get the perfect tempo for your entire beat. Great loops don't feel like loops -- they perfectly come back around so it sounds like a real musician is playing the instrument over and over again. A straight beat is great. But most songs are made up of several related beats, each coming together to provide excitement and movement. The new beats, however, are almost always closely related. Some ideas for breakdowns and changes include: Add a new melody line: A new sample, some brief vocals, or the re-emerging melody line usually signals a \\"chorus\\" or sing-along section of the beat. This is usually the most memorable part of the beat. Drop to a minimal beat: Dropping to just drums and bass, or even just drums, is a great way to lower the energy. You can then blast the beat back to pump the song back up and get the crowd really moving. Building and dropping: Add volume, new instruments, and drums to grow tension and energy, then drop out to a big, bassy, and danceable section. These are more nebulous concepts of music composition, and every producer has different preferences. No matter what you choose, think about these three concepts to make interesting, layered beats. Tension: Found in juxtaposition, tension is what pulls the song forward. It is the difference between the intense moment before a \\"drop\\" in dubstep and the cathartic, slower boom after the drop -- this difference creates tension, which creates greater songs. Energy: What is the tempo of the song? How does it change or evolve, and does it bring the crowd with it? Some songs need full energy the entire time, plowing ahead. Others songs benefit from slow builds, changes, and swings in energy. Space: What is the beat for? If it is for a rapper, you best leave some moments of near \\"silence\\" so that they can get the words out. Think of how \\"full\\" your ears feel -- sometimes simpler is good, allowing one instrument to shine. Sometimes you need all 30 tracks at once.","completion":"This article discusses the process of creating unique beats in music production, focusing on elements such as tempo, the use of various percussion sounds, bass lines, melodies, looping, beat changes, and the concepts of tension, energy, and space in composition."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.

Gunmen launched grenades and used machetes against Muslims being evacuated in a truck convoy in Central African Republic, killing at least three children and 19 adults, a humanitarian group said Saturday. At least 23 more people, including children, were injured in Friday's attack and were being treated in a hospital in Bouar, in the northwestern part of the country, said Michael McCusker with Save the Children in Bangui, the nation's capital. The African country has been wracked with such serious religious and ethnic violence, including between Muslims and Christians, that the United Nations has said it fears a genocide could be brewing, and aid groups warn of a humanitarian crisis. The convoy was carrying mostly Muslim families from the village of Vakap when a grenade was launched into the trucks, said officials with Save the Children, a U.K.-based aid group. Attackers hacked many victims with machetes, the group said. Nearly a million flee violence. The mostly Muslim families in the convoy were being evacuated from violence and were ultimately destined for refuge in neighboring Cameroon. \\"It is a sign of the still fraught and highly dangerous situation in the Central African Republic that children and their families have been attacked and killed while trying to evacuate to safety,\\" said Robert Lankenau, the group's director in the country. The Bouar hospital treats both Christians and Muslims, the group said. Security has deteriorated since the country's interim leaders, President Michel Djotodia and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, announced their resignation at a regional summit in Chad this month. Chaos struck the Central African Republic last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, the latest in a series of coups since its independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, then became interim president in a coup. Since then, political turmoil and violence has spread. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition. To counter the attacks on their communities, Christians assembled vigilante groups and fought back. The violence prompted U.N. fears about a genocide brewing. Children beheaded as violence grows. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence, and some 958,000 more people, many of them children, have been forced from their homes within the Central African Republic, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR. There are also more than 86,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo who fled the Central African Republic in 2013, the UNHCR said Friday. Some 100,000 people have gathered at a makeshift camp by the international airport in Bangui, seeking refuge from the violence.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance.

Let's solve this step by step, like pieces of a puzzle. Our puzzle is: 2595 + 225 - 247 = -542*c - 679 First, let's solve the left side of the equation: 2595 (two thousand, five hundred ninety-five) + 225 (two hundred twenty-five) = 2820 (two thousand, eight hundred twenty) Now subtract 247 (two hundred forty-seven) from 2820 (two thousand, eight hundred twenty): 2820 - 247 = 2573 (two thousand, five hundred seventy-three) Now our puzzle looks like this: 2573 = -542*c - 679 Next, let's move the -679 (negative six hundred seventy-nine) to the other side. To do that, we add 679 to both sides: 2573 + 679 = -542*c Now, add those numbers on the left side: 2573 + 679 = 3252 (three thousand, two hundred fifty-two) So now our puzzle is: 3252 = -542*c Lastly, let's find the value of \\"c\\". We can do that by dividing 3252 (three thousand, two hundred fifty-two) by -542 (negative five hundred forty-two): 3252 ÷ -542 = c Once we divide, we find that: c = -6 (negative six) So, the final answer to the puzzle is c = -6.

Next time I'll setup a website dedicated to this scam. When my kids are teasing each other and their friends \\"would you rather kiss a pig or eat at Jou00ebl Robuchon\\" even zero stars would be too many. I'm not sure how anyone in their right mind would give this place 5 stars unless they just want to pretend that they went to an awesome place that no mere mortal will afford and can't discover the truth. We didn't mind paying just to see the place and experience supposedly the best food by the chef of the century, but the whole deal was a 4-hour ceremony during which a few classy butlers pretend to give you something to eat while you're supposed to pretend that it's good. Literally each and every course was the size of a scallop with one of the courses actually being exactly one scallop and another one a mashroom. If brought together at once the total size of the 16-course meal would be smaller than a kids meal at any other restaurant. Adding to the insult was that most of these items were inedible, we came home hungry and just warmed up whatever we found in our fridge. Let's start with the look: the place looks simply tacky with its classical decor mismatched to the partially modern ceiling, the oversized chandelier overpowering the small room, the purple sofas that seem to be bought from Hugh Heffner, and cheap looking fake plastic diamonds sprinkled on the dining tables. But that's forgivable given that we came here to eat, not to admire the settings. We decided on two of the 16-course 385 meals which was recommended by so many other reviewers, assuming that our two kids will also taste some dishes. First, the butler brings a large block of butter and shaves a few pieces onto a plate while explaining that the butter is from Great Britain. Then he brings a large cart with selection of 16 different breads, which look and smell great but you can't really eat them because they ask you to select a few kinds and when you point to the 3 or 4 that look most interesting they drop one small slice of each on your table and quickly haul the cart away. You won't see it again. You then spread the English butter onto the bread to find out that the butter tastes just like any butter, whether from Guatemalan or a local cow. The bread itself was quite good and possibly one of the best items of the evening, however, you can go down to the M Resort buffet and get as much of the similar and better breads as you want and keep coming back for more. Here with the bread we also got a small portion of caviar on top of rolled crab meat. The caviar must've been the most expensive tasteless item we had there, but the canned crab meat was decent. The next couple courses included another outrageously expensive and highly sought item: shaved truffles. We were trying to discover what's so distinct about them but the only thing we discovered was taste of a shaved tree bark, actually looking just like that as well. Of course we have never tasted a tree bark before but we could imagine that it'd taste just like these truffles. The rest of the weird dishes included a tiny frog leg, a scallop, and other Lilliput size items, the worse being bacon foam that tasted just like warm whipped fat from the bacon - something so awful it should've been offered in a food eating competition on CBS Survivor. After spending 3.5 hours at this torturous ceremony we finally arrived at the end of the tunnel as the butler brought a desert cart filled with variety of chocolates and cake pieces. Although each one was the size of 5 stacked up pennies we already figured out the game and asked for a sample of each. The butler looked at us and said \\"all 40 of them\\"? We all replied \\"Yes!\\" and finally started enjoying ourselves by swallowing each piece while the butler was placing it on the table. Not by any means does this mean that we got what we paid for but at least we had 5 minutes of enjoyment and wished the whole experience was like that. This was also the first time I saw smiles on my kids' faces (aged 8 and 12). We were prepared to spend around 1000 and the bill was little below 900, so no problem there. Although the fact that our kids were charged 7 for each of the Sprite refills (28 for four) should be noted. Finally, we were given a bag with small box of dessert pieces and two beautiful certificates of attendance with our names on them and the list of all 16 courses we were supposed to enjoy. We were also given a nice color brochure with pictures of each those items. All this looks pretty, but at the same time embarrassing - like being given a certificate of investing with Madoff. You could show it off only until everyone else figures out that Madoff was a crook. In the end we will remember this place as one of the worst experiences of our lives and we would not go there again even if the food was free.

One thing she wanted to do was to get more pay for farm workers so they could buy their children the things they needed. Dolores knew that many farm workers moved often from one place to another to help pick different kinds of fruits and vegetables. She began talking and writing about these workers. Even people who lived far from California read what Dolores wrote. Getting higher pay for the farm workers was not easy. Dolores worked hard to make sure that farm workers got good pay for their work. She knew that nothing would change unless people made new laws to help the workers. Through all her hard work, new laws were made that gave farm workers good pay. Dolores Huerta has worked for more than 30 years in many different ways to make life better for working people.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are most buildings heated with?\\" is \\"electromagnetic energy\\", given that most buildings are heated with turbine generators?","completion":"While it is true that electromagnetic energy is involved in the process of generating heat in many buildings, the direct answer to the question \\"what are most buildings heated with?\\" would not be \\"electromagnetic energy.\\" Instead, it would be more accurate to state that most buildings are heated using either natural gas, oil, electricity, or a combination of these sources. Allow me to provide a detailed explanation for better understanding: Natural gas and oil-fired heating systems make use of a furnace or boiler to burn the fuel, generating heat that is then transferred to air or water. This heated air or water is then circulated throughout the building to provide warmth via radiators, baseboard heating, or forced-air systems. And yes, in some cases, turbine generators are used to produce electricity, which is then used for heating purposes. However, these generators are typically powered by natural gas, coal, or nuclear energy. Where electromagnetic energy comes in is when we talk about generating heat using electrical sources like electrical resistance heaters, heat pumps, and electric radiant heaters. When electricity flows through these systems, it generates electromagnetic energy, which then gets converted to heat. However, even in these cases, the main source of heating is still electricity, rather than electromagnetic energy. In conclusion, though electromagnetic energy plays a role in heating systems that utilize electric sources, the most accurate answer to the question would be that most buildings are heated with natural gas, oil, or electricity. The way these sources are converted to heat in different heating systems varies, but listing electromagnetic energy as a primary heating source would be misleading."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang? from the following article ? ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

The character Tom Destry, or simply Destry, was played by James Stewart. Marlene Dietrich also featured prominently in the film as the character Frenchy. This film was actually a comeback for Dietrich and significantly boosted Stewart's career. However, in the given sentence, there is no mention of \\"Destry Rides Again\\" or of James Stewart, and thus it does not answer the question of who played Destry in that specific film. Deanna Durbin and Gloria Jean – the actresses referred to in the sentence – are not associated with the film. Durbin was a Canadian-born actress who enjoyed popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with musical films, and Gloria Jean was a prominent child star at the time. It's important to note that in the context of Deanna Durbin and Gloria Jean, their career trajectories have a connection with the producer Joe Pasternak, who moved away from producing Durbin's films to working with young Jean on a series of musicals. The sentence then mentions Jean's successful assignments opposite stars like Bing Crosby, W.C Fields, and Donald O'Connor. Still, despite these details about their careers, neither Durbin nor Jean was connected to the film \\"Destry Rides Again\\".

By any measure the opera was a disaster compared to the symphony, as the Pick from: (A). opera was so lavishly funded.. (B). symphony was so lavishly funded..","completion":"B. symphony was so lavishly funded. By any measure, the opera was a disaster compared to the symphony, as the symphony was so lavishly funded. The management had spared no expense in ensuring that every element of the symphony was taken care of, down to the minutest detail. The orchestra had been given the best possible instruments, and they'd invited renowned musicians worldwide to join their ranks. Some of them, like the first-chair violinist and the soloist soprano, had agreed to generous sums to secure their talents. The costumes for the symphony's performers were designed and tailored by the most skilled artisans in the industry, and each piece was adorned with a plethora of exquisite details that would sparkle under the stage lights. The stage itself was host to magnificent backdrops and extravagant props that created an enchanting atmosphere for the audience to step into. The lighting and sound design alone were of the highest quality available, ensuring that each musician could convey their movements and melodies in perfect harmony with one another. In contrast, the opera's production felt bare-boned and lifeless. With a meager budget to work with, the team was left to scrounge for whatever money they could, with neither the management nor the patrons seeing much value in the production – a fact that became apparent upon attending the performances. The costumes, if they could be called that, were made from low-quality materials and barely held together, falling apart at the seams with every step the performers took on stage. The stage set could hardly be compared to the symphony's – minimal at best, consisting of a few painted flats that didn't do much to convince the audience of a different place or time. For the musicians and singers, there were none of the stellar performers the symphony boasted. Instead, they had a ragtag group of undertrained local artists who might have been passionate about their craft but lacked the prestige and skill that their counterparts in the symphony possessed. As the performances unfolded, it was obvious to all but the most oblivious observer that the opera stood little chance of success in the shadow of the spectacular symphony. The audience for the opera was often left wondering what could have been, had they been able to see a production on par with that of the symphony's. The singers and musicians, despite their best efforts, were unable to perform at their fullest potential, hindered as they were by the dire lack of funding and support. Throughout the run, the symphony continued to amass accolades and admiration from local and international critics alike. The opera, on the other hand, limped along for a few more performances before it was shuttered for good. The cast and crew disbanded, the production assets sold off, and the once-promising idea of the opera was relegated to the annals of history. In a world where resources were limited, and where art had to compete against commerce and politics, the symphony emerged victorious. The opera was an unfortunate casualty of that struggle, a sad reminder that sometimes, no matter how grand, the underdog won't always gain the recognition it deserves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The duo were disappointed with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, who felt that he sang poorly. Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers.

The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991, he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate. However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel.

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family.

She was well aware of the fact that her age and financial situation called for a more conservative approach to investing. After careful consideration and consultation with her financial advisor, she decided to prioritize a strategy that focused on generating stable income and protecting her capital, rather than chasing higher returns with increased levels of risk. The decision to have a higher concentration of bonds in her portfolio was based on various factors. First, bonds are typically seen as a more stable and conservative form of investment when compared to stocks. They provide a fixed income in the form of interest payments, and the repayment of the principal amount is guaranteed as long as the issuer does not default. This predictable stream of income was appealing to the senior woman, as she could use it to cover her living expenses during her retirement years without having to worry about market fluctuations affecting her primary sources of income. Secondly, bonds, particularly those issued by governments and high-quality corporations, have a lower degree of risk compared to stocks. Although they might offer lower potential returns, they also entail less price volatility and a lower likelihood of experiencing significant losses. For the senior woman, preserving her capital was more important than chasing higher returns, as she did not have the luxury of time to recover from potential losses that may come with riskier investments. Additionally, having a higher concentration of bonds in her portfolio would help to protect her from the potential impacts of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates. Fixed-income investments like bonds can act as a hedge against inflation and interest rate changes, as their prices typically have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices may fall, but the income generated from those bonds will generally offset any losses in value. This provides a level of stability and security that is important for an investor in their senior years. Lastly, the senior woman also acknowledged the importance of diversification in her investment strategy. While having a high concentration of bonds in her portfolio provided the stability and security she desired, she was also aware of the need to maintain a small exposure to stocks or other growth-oriented assets to ensure some level of growth potential. This would help her to maintain the purchasing power of her investments and keep up with rising costs during her retirement years. In summary, the senior woman's portfolio was low on stocks but high in bonds as she considered the potential risks and benefits associated with each type of investment. By prioritizing a more conservative investment approach focused on capital preservation and predictable income, she aimed to ensure financial security and stability during her retirement years, while still maintaining some exposure to growth-oriented assets for diversification purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: In 1933, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman adopted a brighter shade of red for the team's home kit, known as \\"Chapman Red\\" or \\"Arsenal Red.\\" This shade replaced the darker \\"plum red\\" that the team had been wearing since 1913. Chapman believed that the brighter red would make it easier for the players to spot each other on the field and help instill a sense of identity and pride in the team. There are several stories behind Chapman's inspiration for adopting this new shade of red. One such story suggests that he noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt, which caught his attention and sparked the idea to change the team's colors. Another account claims that Chapman was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom he played golf. Regardless of the exact inspiration, the adoption of the brighter red shade was a significant change for the team, and the color has since become synonymous with Arsenal Football Club. Arsenal Red is a distinct and vivid shade often described as having a hint of orange or even a slight resemblance to vermilion or scarlet. The exact hue, however, may vary slightly depending on the specific materials used in the production of jerseys and other merchandise. The change to Arsenal Red was met with great enthusiasm from both players and fans and remains a defining characteristic of the team's identity to this day. In addition to adopting the brighter red, Chapman also introduced white sleeves for the team's home jerseys, which further added to the contrast and visual appeal of the kit. This unique combination of a bright red shirt with white sleeves, now recognized as a trademark of the club, has remained largely unchanged throughout the decades and is considered a classic design in the world of football. In summary, Herbert Chapman adopted a brighter shade of red known as \\"Chapman Red\\" or \\"Arsenal Red\\" to energize the team's image and facilitate better on-field recognition among players. The inspiration for this change is said to have come from observing a fan or possibly a cartoonist wearing a similarly colored outfit, but the exact origin of the idea remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the introduction of the brighter red and the accompanying white sleeves has had a lasting impact on the identity and brand of Arsenal Football Club."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The HOPE IS A GAME--CHANGER PROJECT will deliver unbreakable soccer balls to kids who, all too often, see things horrible, broken and not survive the simplest of circumstances. The project started taking form well before anyone knew where it would lead -which is to test the power of like-minded people working together to turn inspiration into action. Four years ago Bobby was in Rwanda offering help to the people there and taking photos of a child soldier named Moise with his \\"soccer ball\\",which was a pile of rubbish tied together with a string. This \\"ball\\" was the only thing Moise could call his own --- no family, no home, no place to go. Forced to fight in the Congo and having killed three people at the unbearably young age of seven, the boy's spirit was broken. And Bobby knew, as he took one photo after the next, that he'd never forget him. In fact, he returned the following year to tell Moise he had stayed deep within his heart ---but he was gone. I recently helped Bobby launch his new bookThe Power of the Invisible Sunwhich features a photo of Moise, his ball, and kids from war-torn areas around the world. All of his earnings go towards the HOPE IS A GAME-CHANGER PROJECT for the kids he visited over the past decade. They caught the emotional landscape from heartbreak to joy, but share the undeniable longing for recovery and hope. Bobby and I share the unchangeable belief that delivering hope is really a game-changer, especially to a child. We believe that each indestructible ball will come to represent a lasting symbol of hope. A light no matter how small---The Power of the Invisible Sun.

Write a title for this article: AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS, probably the greatest user of an in— house ad agency among the top advertisers, is stripping that agency of all of the advertising functions except media buying. That means that five American Home ad agencies will enjoy a multimillion-dollar windfall. The biggest bonanza goes to the William Esty Company - getting Anacin in four forms, which received 32.3 million in advertising in 1980. That figure and all the other billing figures used here are those published in Leading National Advertisers for that year. Preparation H, a line of hemorrhoid-treatment products that billed 1 0.7 million, goes to Kornhauser & Calene, and Maximum Strength An acin, billing 7.7 million, goes to Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson. All the pharmaceutical brands are from Whitehall Laboratories, as are Trendar and Oxipur, two small brands, that will go to Korhauser & Calene and to Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson, repectively. Then from the Boyle-Midway division, Aerowax, with very little in billings, and Easy-Off oven cleaner, with about 6 million, is being assigned to Cunningham & Walsh, and Sani Flush in the Tank, billing about 2.2 million, will go to Hicks & Greist. The commissions to the agencies, which will be creating the advertising and planning the media, will not, of course, be the full 15 percent, but will probably be in the neighborhood of 11 percent. The house agency is the John F. Murray Agency, which had been part of the American Home Products operation for years, but usually for small brands. Then, in the autumn of 1967, the agency business was shocked to hear that American Home Products was moving its flagship brand, Anacin, out of Ted Bates & Company, which had made it famous with its hammers-in-the-head and fast-fast-fast-relief advertising, and moved it into Murray. That move could very well have been responsible for numerous changes in thinking on the part of advertisers, especially smaller advertisers. Soon after the change, the debates on the merits and failings of house agencies began to boil over, especially at the annual meetings of the Association of National Advertisers. There were all sorts of experiments that were being reported on annually. Ironically, the argument for use of in-house shops usually came down to cost. And now, here in a down economy, American Home Products announces this step. It follows by just a few days an announcement by Lever Brothers, which told its agencies that its in-house media unit would no longer plan media programs, but would execute the plans, the responsibility for which would be returned to Lever's agencies. Apparently the A.H.P. decision evolved from the classic argument against house agencies - you can't get good creativity.

Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia. During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers. While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he dress feminine as a child?","completion":"Yes, Little Richard did dress feminine as a child.

John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However, bridge building experts throughout the world thought this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea, but Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. \\"We told them so.\\" \\"Crazy men and their crazy dreams.'' \\"It's foolish to chase wild visions.\\" Evcryone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap, Washington was never discouraged. One day he was lying on his bed in hospital, seeing the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment with the sunlight streaming through the windows, and a gentle breeze bowing the flimsy white curtains apart when an idea hit him. He decided to make the best use of the only finger he could move. Thus, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm until the bridge was finally completed. Question: What can we learn about Washington's wife? Options: A: She could understand Washington and helped him a lot. B: She cnuldn't understand him but took good care of him.

Q: if you were turned into a bee, name something you'd have to learn how to do. A:","completion":"If you were turned into a bee, there are several essential tasks and behaviors you would need to learn how to perform in order to thrive in your new life. Some of these crucial activities include: 1. Flying: As a bee, the ability to fly is critical for various purposes, such as foraging for nectar and pollen, navigating the environment, and escaping predators. You'd need to learn how to control your newly acquired wings and achieve a stable flight pattern. 2. Communication: Bees use a complex dance called the waggle dance to communicate information about food sources and coordinate their foraging efforts. Being able to understand and perform this dance would be vital for sharing information with other bees in your colony. 3. Foraging and collecting resources: Bees gather nectar and pollen from flowers, which serve as their primary food sources. You would need to learn how to locate flowers containing these resources, extract nectar using your proboscis (a bee's tongue-like structure), and collect pollen using your specialized hairs and leg structures called pollen baskets. 4. Defending the hive: Worker bees protect their hive from intruders and potential predators. As a bee, you might have to learn to use your stinger to fend off threats, although it's important to note that honeybees die after stinging as their stinger gets dislodged from their body. 5. Building and maintaining the hive: Bees construct their hives using beeswax, a substance secreted by their wax glands. You would need to learn how to produce and manipulate beeswax to build honeycomb structures for storing food and raising the colony's brood. 6. Caring for the brood: As a worker bee, you may be assigned to nurse and care for the developing eggs, larvae, and pupae in the hive. This involves feeding, grooming, and maintaining optimal temperatures within the brood chamber. 7. Understanding the colony's hierarchy: Bees live in highly social and structured colonies, consisting of the queen bee, male drones, and female worker bees. Each member plays a specific role in the colony's functioning, so it would be essential to recognize your role and how to effectively collaborate with the other bees.

Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984. The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work, greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate Grant Hardy, Dr. Gordon C.

The summer transfer window is now closed! It means that soccer teams are done buying and selling players for now. Let's talk about some of these cool changes that happened in the world of soccer. First up, Chelsea did a great job of adding new players to their team and also letting go of some players they didn't need anymore. One important player, Diego Costa, is really helping out his team. He's playing so well that the team is now at the very top of the league table! Next, we have Danny Welbeck. He's a young soccer player who is only 23 years old. Danny used to play for Manchester United, but now he has joined Arsenal, a different team, in a big £16million deal. He really wants to show everyone that he's a great player and has a lot to prove! Now let's talk about Hull. They made some really cool choices by bringing in new players to the team. One of them is Hatem Ben Arfa, who is just borrowing the team. This is called a loan. Isn't that neat? Guess what? Another team, QPR, got a new player named Sandro! He will be really strong and powerful when he helps his team in the middle of the soccer field. That area is called central midfield. Lastly, there were two amazing players named Xabi Alonso and Toni Kroos. A lot of people wish they had moved to the Premier League, but they chose to play in other places. Sometimes, that's just how things work. So there you have it, kids! Those were the exciting changes that happened in the world of soccer during the summer transfer window. Some teams got stronger and better, and we can't wait to see how they play!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A North Carolina resident was found guilty Thursday on terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people overseas. Anes Subasic, a 35-year old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Bosnia, also was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. He will face up to life in prison at sentencing in August. Subasic is the seventh member of a North Carolina group of men convicted of terror activities. They were led by Daniel Boyd, who pleaded guilty in February 2011 to conspiring to kill people abroad and to provide material support to terrorists. Boyd's sentencing was delayed so that he could testify against three other co-conspirators who were found guilty last fall. Two of Boyd's sons also pleaded guilty and are in prison.

Review: Anna (Ursula Andress) is brought in as an official R.N. by ex-lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, Count Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), back to health after a heart attack. But Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count. He has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more \\"vulnerable\\" as he is cured. The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count. The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable. But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and oh how good. There are many nude scenes, including ones of Anna and Jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental ex-Bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. As she did in Thunderball (remember Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays a femme fatale, sort of, although less elegantly. Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone, the \\"other patient\\" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot. But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. However, Benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and Jole. This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. The Count is free, as the client, to put his hands wherever he wants to on Ursula, and he takes advantage. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions. Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase. \\"The Sensuous Nurse\\" is compact, 77 minutes, but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption, start to finish.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...
