In a surprising turn of events, the police chief agrees to step down to make way for new leadership committed to reforming the department. This change sparks hope in the protesters, and they continue to work together with the police force, as both sides are engaged in open dialogue and project, leading to substantial improvements in policing policies and practices. The city of Albuquerque sees a dramatic decrease in the use of excessive force, and the relationship between the community and law enforcement is rebuilt on a foundation of trust and collaboration. Years later, the city serves as a model for other cities facing tensions between law enforcement and citizens, showcasing how peaceful protests and the willingness to listen and change can create a safer, more unified community for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Head mentions PersonX accepting PersonY's invitation, while the Tail describes an emotion, i.e., being happy. As accepting an invitation may lead to happiness, there seems to be a connection between the Head and the Tail. However, being happy is a broader, more universal emotion and can be achieved through various other ways and experiences that are not necessarily linked to accepting an invitation.

Sentence (2): \\"He lives in Noah and Mabel with his wife Lucy and their children.\\" This sentence is not grammatically correct and does not provide a clear understanding of the family structure. Assuming \\"Noah and Mabel\\" refers to a location, it says that a man lives in this location with his wife, Lucy, and their children. However, the children's names are not mentioned, and Mabel is now part of the location rather than being the wife.

Please answer the following question: No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do. Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof. Bowled over by their praise – he is a man whose emotions are close to the surface – Krzysztof asked if he could give them a hug, probably a... Why did they sing to the inspectors?

Brad had to study forest soils, while his colleague Frank had to study grasslands. They both did a good job and received A's for their efforts and accumulated knowledge. But I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. What is an answer for this question: Which student read less about slow rates of decomposition? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Frank, who studied grassland soils, read less about slow rates of decomposition as compared to Brad, who studied forest soils. The mentioned slow rates of decomposition and the process of podzolization are specific to forest soils and directly related to Brad's area of study. In contrast, grassland soils have different characteristics and processes that likely did not include this level of detail about slow decomposition rates. Therefore, the answer is Frank."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class. Ned studied more about predators, while Kim studied more about herbivores.

Summarize this article: John Krasinski’s surprise hit “A Quiet Place” has returned to its No. 1 slot in its third weekend at the domestic box office with 20 million from 3,808 theaters, up 219 sites from last weekend. In second is last weekend’s box office topper, Dwayne Johnson’s “Rampage,” with about 18 million from 4,115 theaters. The action film opened to 35 million last weekend, narrowly beating out “A Quiet Place’s” second frame. “A Quiet Place” stars Krasinski and wife Emily Blunt as a couple trying to keep their family safe in a world populated by aliens that hunt based on sound. The Paramount film has grossed a respectable 116 million through Friday, including 56 million from foreign markets. In its first seven days, Warner Bros.’ “Rampage” has earned 187 million globally to a 120 million production budget, with 141 million from overseas. Directed by Brad Peyton and also starring Naomie Harris, the film follows Johnson’s scientist David Okoye, who must join forces with his beloved albino gorilla that has accidentally become massive in order to stop two other giant monsters. The opening weekend of Amy Schumer’s “I Feel Pretty” will likely take third with about 18 million from 3,440 locations, moderately above initial estimates in the 15 million range. The comedy from STXfilms earned about 6 million in Friday previews, with 1 million from Thursday screenings. 2015’s “Trainwreck” debuted with 30 million and elevated Schumer to star status, and 2017’s “Snatched” bowed to 19.5 million with 650,000 in previews. Related 'Super Troopers 2': The Origins of 'Meow' 'A Quiet Place' Sequel in the Works at Paramount “I Feel Pretty” has received a B+ CinemaScore and sits at 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, though women under 18 gave it an A+ CinemaScore and women under 25 rated it an A. The film marks writing partners Marc Silverstein and Abby Kohn’s directorial debut, and also stars Michelle Williams and Emily Ratajkowski. Schumer stars as a woman with low self-confidence who begins to see herself as beautiful after hitting her head in a spin class. “Super Troopers 2,” the fan-funded sequel to the cult 2001 film, will earn around 15 million from 2,038 sites its opening weekend to take fourth place. The R-rated comedy from Fox is debuting more than double early estimates, which predicted a weekend tally of around 6 million, and brought in 7.9 million Friday. Jay Chandrasekhar returns to direct, with the Broken Lizard comedy team — Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske — writing and starring in the film. The quintet plays profane Vermont state troopers with a penchant for pranks and feuding with other local law enforcement officers. “Super Troopers 2” has earned a 33% Rotten Tomatoes rating, with a significantly higher Audience Score of 64%. “Ready Player One” and Blumhouse’s “Truth or Dare” will duke it out for fifth, each set to bring in around 7 million in their fourth and second weekends, respectively. “Ready Player One” has grossed around 480 million in its first 23 days and became Warner Bros. biggest-ever Chinese opening with 61 million. “Truth or Dare” stars Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey as part of a group of teens who are targeted by a killer after beginning a game of truth or dare. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, Jason Blum’s latest has earned 27 million in just over a week. Opening this weekend is Lionsgate’s Codeblack Films’ “Traffik,” which will likely earn around 4 million from 1,046 locations, in line with expectations. Written and directed by Deon Taylor, the thriller stars Paula Patton and Omar Epps, and follows a group of friends who are terrorized by a biker gang in a remote countryside home. The weekend’s releases mark a relative calm before the storm, with Disney-Marvel’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set to give moviegoing a jump start when it opens next weekend with between 190 million and 235 million-plus. ||||| The horror pic 'A Quiet Place' reclaimed the No. 1 spot in its third weekend of release, while 'Rampage' became the weekend's top worldwide grosser. STX Entertainment's I Feel Pretty, Amy Schumer's latest comedic star turn, charmed enough moviegoers to collect an estimated 16.2 million from 3,440 locations at the North America box office over the weekend. But that wasn't enough to knock John Krasinski's horror movie A Quiet Place out of the top spot, which the Paramount release reclaimed during its third weekend of release, taking in an additional 22 million to bring its domestic total to 132 million, or to bump Warner Bros.' Dwayne Johnson starrer Rampage from the No. 2 slot as the sci-fi/monster pic took in 21 million in its second weekend of release, bringing its domestic tally to 66.6 million. As for the other new releases, the Fox Searchlight comedy Super Troopers 2 debuted in fourth position with 14.7 million from 2,038 theaters, and the Lionsgate thriller Traffik opened in ninth place, claiming 3.9 million from 1,046 screens. On the global scene, Rampage dominated. Domestically, the film, attracting a multicultural audience, especially in the West and South, dropped just 41 percent in its second weekend. Internationally, it took in another 57 million from 61 territories; its offshore take stands at 216.4 million and it has amassed 283.3 million worldwide. Rampage has performed like gangbusters in China, where it has collected 106.6 million. Warner Bros.' Ready Player One, which ranked sixth for the weekend domestically as it pulled in 7.5 million to bring its domestic purse to 126.2 million, crossed the 500 million mark globally on Saturday, becoming only the second Hollywood film of the year to do so behind Black Panther. It is also the first film Steven Spielberg has directed to earn north of 500 million since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (786.6 million) in 2008. For the full weekend, Ready Player One picked up 23 million from 68 territories, bringing its worldwide gross to 521.6 million. And, on the international side, A Quiet Place notched another 15 million from 58 territories as its worldwide gross rose to 207.2 million. Meanwhile, I Feel Pretty's third-place opening fell short of Schumer's last two features, 2015's Trainwreck, which debuted to 30.1 million, and 2017's Snatched, which bowed to 19.5 million, but it did edge ahead of prerelease expectations, which had pegged the pic's opening in the 13 million to 15 million range. The PG-13-rated comedy was financed by Voltage for 32 million, with STX acquiring U.S. and U.K. rights for 15 million. In the movie, directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, Schumer plays a woman who believes she looks like a supermodel after bumping her head in a spinning class. The film's current score on Rotten Tomatoes is an unenthusiastic 34 percent, but moviegoers enjoyed it more than critics, awarding it a B+ CinemaScore from audiences, with women under 25 responding the most enthusiastically. The pic added in another 2.4 million from five foreign territories to bring its total to 18.6 million. I Feel Pretty co-stars Michelle Williams, Rory Scovel, Emily Ratajkowski, Aidy Bryant, Busy Philipps, Tom Hopper, Naomi Campbell and Lauren Hutton. Fox Searchlight's R-rated Super Troopers 2 — a follow-up to the 2002 cult hit — is doing more than double the business prerelease tracking suggested it would. The sequel was written by and stars the Broken Lizard comedy troupe: Jay Chandrasekhar, Brian Cox, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Leme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske. The first film launched to 6.2 million domestically. This time out, the oddball troopers attempt to resolve an international border dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The movie's Rotten Tomatoes score is presently 35 percent, the same score as the first film's, and it earned a B+ CinemaScore from audiences. Super Troopers 2 was financed by a crowdfunding campaign that raised a hearty 4.4 million. The R-rated Traffik, from Lionsgate's Codeblack label, was directed by Deon Taylor and revolves around a couple (Paula Patton and Omar Epps) who are terrorized by a biker gang at a remote country getaway. In its second weekend, Universal and Blumhouse's Truth or Dare checked in in fifth place with 7.9 million for a 10-day domestic total of 30.4 million. Fox Searchlight's animated Isle of Dogs, from director Wes Anderson, expanded to its widest point, playing in 1,947 locations, securing the 10th spot on the chart, with a three-day gross of 3.4 million and a 24.3 million cume to date.

Possible A: library, lawn, front door, jail, subway Why is \\"library\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Library\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because libraries are well-known institutions for collecting, storing, and preserving various types of print and digital media, including newspapers. They often maintain archives of local, national, and international newspapers, some of which may date back to several decades or even centuries. In contrast, the other options provided do not have strong associations with storing or preserving old newspapers. A lawn or front door is not a place where one would expect old newspapers to be collected or stored systematically; rather, they are potential locations for recently delivered newspapers. Moreover, newspapers found on lawns or front doors are typically exposed to the elements and therefore not well-preserved. A jail relates more to incarceration and crime rather than information storage or the preservation of print media. Lastly, a subway is primarily a mode of transportation, and while it is possible to find discarded newspapers there, they would likely be recent and not viewed as a reliable source for finding old newspapers.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Question: When was the transition where many of John's colleagues got fired and moved around?

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Think about your current state of mind and life circumstances and ask yourself if your romantic feelings might be caused by these factors. Sometimes life events can cause people to seek comfort, stability, excitement, or validation from other people in our lives who they don't genuinely want to be with. Avoid pursuing a relationship with your best friend if you might be using them to feel better. For instance, you may seek comfort and distraction in a romance with your best friend after a death in the family. Take things slowly in your new relationship so that you can both figure out your feelings without distractions. Romantic touching and sexual contact can blur the lines of a relationship and confuse boundaries. Try to let your physical relationship evolve naturally out of genuine chemistry and affection. Acting on physical urges too soon may make the situation awkward or increase the intensity of your relationship very quickly. Moving slowly is a good way of avoiding confusing hot-and-cold behaviour. Making a grand romantic move one week, then acting like a casual buddy the next will leave your friend unsure of your feelings. Take things slow and gradually build up to bigger gestures or commitments so you won't be overwhelmed by the situation. For instance, don't show up to your friend's workplace with flowers one day and introduce them to colleagues as your \\"buddy\\" a few days later. Taking things to the next level with your best friend can reinforce an already strong bond, making it tempting to spend all of your time with them. Take some time apart to pursue your own interests and to make sure that you get the chance to miss each other. This will make you appreciate each other even more while reducing the risk of becoming annoying to each other. For example, take time to visit with other friends or spend some quiet time alone at home. Summary:","completion":"Consider your current mental state and life circumstances when evaluating romantic feelings towards your best friend, as these factors may influence your emotions.

The Walloon Legion (French: \\"Légion Wallonie\\" ) was a collaborationist volunteer unit recruited from Belgium's French-speaking population in Wallonia and Brussels during the German occupation of World War II. The Walloon Legion served in the Wehrmacht, later in the Waffen-SS, on the Eastern Front on both front line and reserve duties. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Walloon Legion served on the front line and reserve duties.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can draw the conclusion that the Walloon Legion served on both front line and reserve duties during World War II. But it would be useful to elaborate on this topic to provide a clearer understanding and context. The Walloon Legion was formed in July 1941 as a volunteer military unit and was initially known as the Corps Franc Wallonie. Its members were primarily French-speaking Belgian civilians, including citizens from the Wallonia region and Brussels. These collaborationist volunteers were motivated by various reasons, such as anti-communist beliefs, desire to repel the Soviet Union's expansion, political opportunism, and even some economic motivations. The Walloon Legion was initially integrated into the German Wehrmacht as an auxiliary unit. The soldiers received limited training and were equipped with German weapons, uniforms, and insignia. They were sent to the Eastern Front to participate in the German invasion of the Soviet Union known as Operation Barbarossa. In the early stages of its existence, the Walloon Legion served mainly in combat and front-line duties, engaging in battles against the Soviet Red Army. They fought in several significant engagements, including the Siege of Leningrad and the Battle of Velikiye Luki. However, due to heavy losses and attrition, by 1943, the strength and capabilities of the unit had significantly diminished. As a result, the Walloon Legion was reorganized and officially absorbed into the Waffen-SS in June 1943, becoming the SS-Sturmbrigade Wallonien. This transition allowed the unit to receive better training, equipment, and support from the German military command. During this period, the Walloon Legion continued to participate in front-line duties but was also assigned to reserve and rear-echelon tasks, such as maintaining security and supporting German occupation forces in several territories in the Eastern Front. Towards the end of World War II, the Walloon Legion's fortunes waned along with those of the Axis forces. In its final months, the unit was engaged in the defense of the collapsing Eastern Front, eventually retreating into Germany. Suffering further losses and desertions, the remnants of the Walloon Legion surrendered to the Allies in May 1945. In conclusion, the Walloon Legion, initially part of the German Wehrmacht and later the Waffen-SS, served in various capacities during World War II. They were engaged on the front lines, participating in major battles on the Eastern Front. In addition, they also carried out reserve and support duties, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of their involvement in the conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mexico escorted by nearly a dozen agents after being extradited. from the United States to face trial over his wife's killing. Former Survivor producer Bruce. Beresford-Redman landed at Cancun's airport late last night and was whisked away in an. SUV accompanied by three police vehicles. He was driven to the state prosecutors' office, which is charging him with the. death of his wife, Monica, whose naked body was found in a sewer cistern at a. Cancun resort following an April 2010 family vacation. Back to Mexico: Bruce Beresford-Redman flew a private government flight to Mexico. Here he has just landed in Cancun. He carried a bottle of water and had his hands cuffed as he exited the plane in what appeared to be a bullet proof vest. Under heavy guard: Beresford-Redman was driven by state police to a jail in Cancun after his extradition to Mexico on a charge of murdering his wife. Whisked away: The former Survivor producer, wearing a bulletproof vest, leaves Cancun's airport in an SUV accompanied by three police vehicles. The noncommercial jet touched down at around 10.40pm on a separate runway where reporters didn't have access. The victim's sister, Carla Burgos, said: 'It was a relief. We have been waiting for that for two years.' Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres, attorney. general for the state of Quintana Roo, said the suspect will be taken to. a jail in the Caribbean resort. He could see a judge anytime within the next three days. Reporters couldn't approach Bruce. Beresford-Redman. From afar, the producer could be seen handcuffed. wearing a white T-shirt and a bulletproof vest. Handouts issued later confirmed his outfit. Awaiting trial: Beresford-Redman (centre) is guarded by state police before he is admitted to a jail in Cancun today. He is due to see a judge within the next three days. Husband and wife: Bruce Beresford-Redman, left, pictured at his. California home in May 2010, is accused of killing his wife, Monica. Beresford-Redman, right. 'Relief': Mrs Beresford-Redman's sister, Carla Burgos (left), and her attorney, Alsion Triessl, address the media about the extradition of Beresford-Redman yesterday. The legal saga of Beresford-Redman has played out on both sides of the border. The U.S. Marshals Service turned the. Emmy-nominated producer over to Mexican federal police Wednesday,. roughly two weeks after State Department officials signed a warrant. clearing his extradition. The producer and his wife Monica. Beresford-Redman had gone to the resort with their young children in an. attempt to save their marriage after she learned her husband was. cheating on her. Mexican authorities say Beresford-Redman murdered his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room on April 5, 2010. Handcuffed: Beresford-Redman was extradited from Los Angeles to Mexico on Wednesday. Returning to Mexico: Beresford-Redman boarded this Aero Mexico plane from Los Angeles to face trial. Her naked body was found in a hotel sewer three days later. Bruce Beresford-Redman opted in December. not to appeal a U.S. court ruling upholding his extradition. Mexican. authorities later said they had reached an agreement for his return. 'Bruce eagerly wants to set the record. straight, confront the charges in a fair trial and return to his. children,' spokesman Stephen Jaffe wrote in an email. Beresford-Redman, an Emmy-nominated. producer, has denied that he killed his wife and his attorneys have. attacked evidence in the case. Had marriage difficulties: The couple took a trip to the exclusive Mexican resort after details of Beresford-Redman's affair emerged. Exclusive: The luxurious Moon Palace Resort in Cancun where the couple vacationed. His U.S. attorneys fought his return to. Mexico, but two federal judges ruled there was ample reason to send him. abroad for trial. Beresford-Redman has also employed. attorneys in Mexico to challenge the validity of the case there. He was. arrested on a fugitive warrant in the Los Angeles area in November 2010. Accused: Mexican police escort Beresford-Redman (centre) inside the attorney general's office in Cancun following his arrest in April, 2010. Mexican and U.S. authorities say he left. Mexico without permission, although Beresford-Redman's lawyers have. claimed he was under no obligation to stay and needed to return to the. U.S. to help care for his children. The family of Monica Beresford-Redman. said the extradition 'marks a major milestone in our journey to ensure. justice for Monica.' 'After nearly 15 months in United States. custody, Bruce will finally be returned to Mexico to stand trial for. Monica's murder,' attorney Alison Triessl wrote in a statement released. on behalf of the family. Triessl said the family will follow the. case in Mexico and will ask for the maximum sentence if Beresford-Redman. is convicted. The maximum sentence could be 12 to 30 years in prison. 'He has always stated that he is. innocent of the charges against him and it is his hope that the court in. Cancun will assure that he receives a fair trial in which, he is. confident, he will be exonerated,' Beresford-Redman's attorney, Richard. Hirsch wrote in a statement. U.S. prosecutors presented statements. from hotel guests who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress. coming from the couple's room on the night Monica Beresford-Redman went. missing. The producer's attorneys have claimed. the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud. games throughout the night and that there isn't any forensic evidence. that he killed his wife.

It is a daunting first assignment for Bradley as Swansea City manager, while Wenger will be taking charge of his first game since celebrating 20 years at the helm at Arsenal. Swansea is Bradley's ninth job - spanning five countries and three continents - since Wenger was appointed Gunners boss. So, as the Premier League's first American manager prepares for his debut, does Wenger have any words of wisdom for his newest rival? \\"No, look, I think Bob Bradley has a big experience - he's not a beginner you know,\\" the Frenchman says. \\"He has travelled a lot, he has accumulated experience in the States and he has been in Egypt, he has been in France just recently. He's coming now to England, what is certainly for him, a fantastic opportunity.\\" Wenger and Bradley have met once before, the latter watching an Arsenal training session during his time as manager of the United States. However, Saturday's encounter will be their first as opponents. And while the 58-year-old's career highlights include leading his country at a World Cup - and topping a group that featured England - Bradley believes his first taste of the Premier League will rank among his proudest moments. \\"It's up there,\\" he says. \\"I don't usually look back on those kind of things but I have had the chance to coach against some pretty big names - [former England and AC Milan manager Fabio] Capello, [former Spain coach Vincente] Del Bosque - but Arsene is right there with the top managers. \\"To be with a club for 20 years where the football that's been played is such a reflection of the man, this is a fantastic thing. \\"[Manchester City manager Pep] Guardiola was doing a press conference last week about Johann Cruyff's book and he was talking about Johann Cruyff's influence. You'd have to say, if you look at everything that's taken place in 20 years at Arsenal, it's the same kind of influence.\\" Swansea's visit to the Emirates is not simply a personal landmark for Bradley - it is a crucial fixture in the team's bid to arrest a slump which has seen them fail to win in the Premier League since the opening day of the season. The Swans are clear of the relegation zone on goal difference alone, while Arsenal are riding high in third place. However, Swansea have an excellent record against the Gunners, winning three of their last five Premier League games at the Emirates. \\"I'm very aware of it [the record] and the part I love about that is we can go there with confidence,\\" says Bradley. \\"We have guys who have won there before, but we have to play well. All the details need to be right. \\"And I'll always go back to the idea of going there to play, to have confidence on the ball. You've got to have the confidence to have people in front of the ball, to create advantages. \\"That will be the football test. We can talk about it all week but it'll come on the day when we're on the ball.\\" The hardy stare from Bradley's piercing blue eyes tells of an unerring professionalism and attention to detail. When he steps out on to the Emirates turf and realises a long-held ambition of managing in one of Europe's most prestigious leagues, however, Bradley will allow himself a brief moment to enjoy the magnitude of the occasion. \\"Yes, I will take a few seconds to look around, look into the stands and then very quickly get my mind back on the game,\\" he says. \\"I won't take a long time but without a doubt. I say the same to the players, then you put it away and get yourself ready for the whistle.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article discusses the upcoming match between Arsenal and Swansea City, which will see Arsène Wenger and Bob Bradley facing off as opposing managers for the first time. The match will be Bradley's first as Swansea City manager, and Wenger's first game since celebrating 20 years at the helm of Arsenal. Wenger expressed that Bradley has a great deal of experience and a fantastic opportunity in England. They both have fond memories of the past and expressed their respect for each other's accomplishments. The match is crucial for Swansea City, as they aim to put an end to their winless streak since the opening day of the season. They remain clear of the relegation zone only on goal difference. However, Swansea City has had past success against Arsenal, winning three of their last five Premier League games at the Emirates.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who convinces the boss to lay off the man who's favorite mug is missing?, using the article: Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off. Derek's friend Ewan is unable to help him, and he is given official notice of his firing by his coworker \\"The Reaper\\". Derek takes his things and is escorted downstairs by company security, dejected and afraid of being disbarred., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who convinces the boss to lay off the man who's favorite mug is missing?\\" is Cara, the superior of Derek Cho, the film's protagonist. She is also referred to as \\"The Siren\\" due to her ability to sway the boss's opinions. In the article, it is mentioned that Derek discovers Cara has taken his favorite mug and confronts her about it. They both go to their boss, John Towers, where Cara persuades him to lay off Derek. Ultimately, it is Cara's influence over the boss that leads to Derek's termination from Towers and Smythe Consulting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

James Graham Mallinson, 72, died when a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to traffic on the A27 on 22 August. A minute's silence was held after the names of the victims were read out at the inquest in Horsham. First causes of death were given as burns and smoke inhalation, fragmentation of body due to blunt-force trauma and head injury. Relatives of some of the people who died in the crash attended the hearing. West Sussex senior coroner Penelope Schofield vowed to conduct a \\"full and fearless inquiry\\" into the disaster. \\"Many people have been affected by the tragic events on August 22, 2015 and my thoughts are primarily with the families,\\" she said. Ms Schofield said the investigation would take time some time and a pre-inquest review would be held on 22 March. The full inquest is expected to take place in June next year, ahead of the first anniversary of the crash. The family of Mr Mallinson, who was known as Graham, said the keen photographer and retired engineer from Newick, East Sussex, had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber which was making one of its last appearances at the air show. \\"He was the kindest and most generous man, who regularly gave his time to help others. Always loyal and reliable, he was a private and loving family man with a great sense of humour,\\" they said in a statement. \\"A very caring husband and father who was dearly loved, he will be very sorely missed by all his family and the wide circle of friends who had the good fortune to know him.\\" Mr Mallinson, who was also a \\"passionate\\" steam railway enthusiast and Bluebell Railway volunteer, was \\"at the right place at the wrong time, doing what he loved best on a beautiful summer's day\\", the family added. The courtroom was packed as a minute's silence was held for the 11 victims of the crash. Some families of those who died were there - they were clearly moved as details of how their loved ones were killed were read out, one after another. Other families chose not to attend and were represented by police liaison officers. We heard how some of the victims were on their way to a football match, others were on a bike ride and some had parked up to watch the air show. They never returned. There was no explanation offered as to why the plane came down on the busy A27. The coroner addressed the families directly, acknowledging they needed answers desperately. She explained how that would take time. For the families, there will clearly be many difficult days ahead. Police have said they have no reason to believe more than 11 people died in the crash. Pilot Andy Hill remains in a critical but stable condition at an unnamed specialist hospital. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is studying the wreckage of the 1950s RAF jet to determine the cause of the disaster. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has imposed restrictions on air shows in the wake of the crash, and the A27 has partially reopened with a 40mph speed limit imposed while investigations continue.

Most medical professionals do say you can drink water before a testing. Explanation: The correct answer aligns with the context of the paragraph - preparing for a stress test. It advises against having anything in the stomach to prevent nausea during the test. It also clarifies that drinking water is allowed before the test, as per most medical professionals. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 1. \\"Caffeine helps with digesting foods quickly. Don't exercise for more than 2 hours before the test.\\" - This statement is incorrect as caffeine may actually interfere with the stress test results. Exercise is typically an important part of a stress test, and limiting exercise for 2 hours prior might not be relevant advice. 2. \\"This may make your symptoms worse or cause you to have changes in your heart rhythm. Don't drink alcohol for longer than 3 days before the test.\\" - This statement is unclear and does not directly relate to the paragraph's topic. It also does not provide any concrete reason for avoiding alcohol for 3 days. 3. \\"Don't drink any alcohol or caffeinated beverages for over 2 hours. Also, remember to avoid coffee or caffeinated teas.\\" - Although it advises against consuming alcohol and caffeinated drinks, the 2-hour time frame is too short since both substances could still impact the stress test results.

And the best part is, the more you cook with the cast iron, the stronger and better this cape gets! Now, let's talk about storing the cast iron in a \\"dry place.\\" Just like how we don't like staying wet after a bath, the cast iron doesn't like it either. When a cast iron stays wet for a long time, it might get sad and covered in \\"rust.\\" Think of rust like orange spots on the cast iron. We don't want that, right? So, to help keep the cast iron happy and rust-free, we need to store it in a place where it can stay dry. Once the cast iron is all clean after cooking, Mommy or Daddy will dry it really well with a towel. After that, they will put it in a cupboard or on a shelf where it has space to breathe. Keeping the cast iron dry will make sure it stays shiny and strong! Now you know how to make sure your cast iron is seasoned and stored in a dry place!

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, but it suggests a different perspective on the situation described in the first sentence. Let's break down both sentences and analyze their content and implications: Sentence 1 describes a scenario in which Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, or other similar individuals are knocking at someone's front door. The speaker feels that this action is intrusive because they have to tell the person to go away, revealing their appearance and living situation to someone uninvited. The speaker also mentions that they typically only invite people to their home, indicating that they value their privacy and personal space. Sentence 2 conveys the idea that someone knocking at the front door represents a sign of respect for one's privacy. This statement can be interpreted as acknowledging the fact that the person knocking did not simply barge in without permission, but rather, made an effort to establish contact and obtain consent before entering the premises. While these two sentences seem to address the same scenario, they present contrasting viewpoints on the matter of privacy. The first sentence emphasizes the intrusive nature of having someone uninvited knock on one's door, while the second sentence focuses on the potential respect shown by the person knocking. It is important to note that the second sentence does not directly follow from the first one; instead, it offers an alternative perspective to consider. In conclusion, while both sentences tackle the issue of privacy in the context of someone knocking on a door, they convey different interpretations of the situation at hand. The second sentence is not entailed by the first, as they present contrasting views on the respect for privacy in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Context: Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\". In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly. Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957). In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks. Question: did he sing any songs in his movies? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Frank Sinatra sang songs in many of his movies. Some examples include \\"From Here to Eternity,\\" where he played a character named Maggio, and \\"Young at Heart\\" where he starred opposite Doris Day.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who sleeps with Tony? In the mid-1970s, Theresa Dunn, a young Irish-American school teacher in New York City, experiences her sexual awakening, while searching for excitement outside her ordered life. While in college, Theresa lives with her repressive Polish-Irish Catholic parents, and suffers from severe body image issues following a childhood surgery for scoliosis that left a large scar on her back. Theresa later finds out that her scoliosis is congenital, and that her aunt had the same condition and committed suicide. As a result, Theresa is reluctant to have children of her own. Meanwhile, her beautiful \\"perfect\\" older sister, Katherine, has left her husband and embarked on a wild lifestyle involving multiple affairs, a secret abortion, recreational drug use, and a short-lived marriage to a Jewish man. Theresa finds first love, and loses her virginity, to her much older, married college professor Martin. He ends their affair just before her graduation, leaving Theresa feeling used and lonely. Theresa takes a job teaching deaf children, and proves to be a gifted and caring teacher. With Katherine's encouragement, she moves out of her parents' home and into an apartment in Katherine's building. She frequents a bar at night where she meets a charming but vain Italian-American character named Tony. She ends up sleeping with, and taking cocaine with Tony.

Please answer a question about the following article about The Blitz: British air doctrine, since the time of Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard in the early 1920s, had stressed offence was the best means of defence. British defensive strategy revolved around offensive action, what became known as the cult of the offensive. To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, RAF's Bomber Command would destroy Luftwaffe aircraft on their own bases, aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy was impractical as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment and needed several years to develop it. This strategy retarded the development of fighter defences in the 1930s. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action, and fighters could not defend Britain alone. Until September 1940, the RAF lacked specialist night-fighting aircraft and relied on anti-aircraft units which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers. What was wrong with the anti aircraft units?","completion":"Alright kiddo, imagine you have a toy slingshot to protect your toys from being taken away by an imaginary thief.

A:","completion":"The first step in the process of an earthquake is the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are large segments of the Earth's crust that are constantly shifting and interacting with one another, floating on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These movements are driven by the heat and convection currents occurring within the Earth's mantle. There are three primary types of interactions between tectonic plates: 1. Divergent boundaries: This occurs when two plates are moving away from each other, creating a gap. Magma from the mantle rises and fills the gap, solidifying and forming new crust. This process is primarily observed at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 2. Convergent boundaries: This takes place when two plates are moving towards each other, causing one plate to be pushed beneath the other in a process called subduction. The subducted plate is forced into the mantle, where it melts due to high temperatures and pressures. Convergent boundaries are responsible for creating volcanic arcs and mountain ranges, such as the Andes and the Himalayas. 3. Transform boundaries: Here, two plates slide past each other horizontally, creating friction and stress along the boundary. This type of interaction is responsible for the formation of strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault in California. As tectonic plates continue to move and interact, stress builds up within the Earth's crust at the boundaries of these plates. When the force of this stress becomes too great, the crust can fracture or slip along a fault line, releasing a sudden burst of energy. This energy then travels through the Earth in the form of seismic waves, causing the ground to shake and resulting in an earthquake. The point within the Earth where the initial slip or fracture occurs is called the focus, and the point on the Earth's surface directly above it is referred to as the epicenter. The magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of the amount of energy released and can be determined by analyzing the seismic waves recorded during the event."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: The two beefsteak tomatoes need to be roasted for 20 to 25 minutes in an oven heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Once cooled, the skin should be peeled off. The tomatoes should weigh about 1 lb (450 g) combined. Preheat an oven or toaster oven to 500 degrees degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil. As the oven heats, prepare the tomatoes by cutting an \\"x\\" through the skin at the bottom of each one. This incision will make it easier to peel away the skin later on. Place the tomatoes on the baking sheet, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Roast the tomatoes until they are well-charred and tender. This should take about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool. The skin should already be peeling away at the \\"x\\" incision you made earlier. Once the tomatoes are cool to the touch, pull off the skin by peeling it away at the \\"x\\" mark. Throw the skin out. The chiles should be seeded and toasted in a large skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant. The chiles should be about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) each. Wipe them clean with a moist paper towel before proceeding. Use a sharp kitchen knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the chiles open lengthwise, from end to end. Dig out the seeds and any large ribs. Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-low heat without oil. Place the chiles on the skillet cut-side-down. Press them down and flip them over with a heat-resistant spatula until they become just barely darkened and fragrant. This should take about 1 minute per chile, and you should work in batches of 1 or 2 chiles at a time. Cover the toasted chiles with cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. Use a medium-size bowl. The chiles should soak until they are softened. Add the garlic and onion to the heated skillet or griddle in batches. Toast each one until they are golden-brown with a few blackened spots. You need about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of peeled garlic. You can add up to twice as much if you prefer a stronger garlic taste. Turn the garlic as necessary to prevent it from blackening too much. The garlic will need to be cooked for about 8 minutes. Only flip the onion slices once. The onion needs to be cooked for roughly 15 minutes. Blend together the drained chiles, tomatoes, garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice with a little water. After the chiles have finished soaking, drain them and place them into your blender. Add the tomatoes to the blender along with any tomato juice they are sitting in. Add the garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice, as well. Puree the sauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, pouring in a little at a time, until the sauce becomes very smooth. This should take around 2 minutes. Heat the oil in a large stockpot before adding the puree. Fry the puree until it becomes thicker. Heat the vegetable oil in a 6-qt (6-l) heavy-duty stockpot over medium heat. A Dutch oven also works well. Add the puree. It will likely splatter, so prepare yourself. Reduce the heat to low. Fry the puree, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, until it thickens. This should take about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup (250 ml) water, as well as the vinegar, sugar, and salt. After adding the water, raise the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a boil. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt. You will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt, but you can add more or less depending on your own sense of taste. Reduce the heat again to medium or medium-low, so that the sauce sits at a steady simmer. Partially cover the pot, leaving a small gap to vent some of the steam. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep the sauce at the same consistency. Summary:","completion":"We need to cook two big tomatoes in an oven at a very hot temperature for about 20-25 minutes. After they cool down, we take off the skin. We also need to clean and cook some chiles in a pan until they smell good. Then, put them in water to soften. We cook garlic and onion in the same pan until they are brown. Later, in a blender, mix the chiles, tomatoes, garlic, onion, and some other spices with a little water to make a smooth sauce.

The first single, \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\", featuring backing vocalist Helen Terry, reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \\"Karma Chameleon\\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No. 1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5 million copies there to date. It also peaked at No. 1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No. 1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up 7 million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer David Levine. The album Colour by Numbers would spawn more hits including \\"Miss Me Blind\\" (#5 US), \\"It's a Miracle\\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \\"Victims\\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 Brit Award for Best Group and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \\"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\\" The group's back-up singer, Helen Terry, began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \\"Love Lies Lost\\". The pair also wrote \\"Passing Friend\\" for the Beach Boys' album. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie Electric Dreams. George and Hay wrote \\"The Dream\\" and \\"Love Is Love\\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada and Japan, the E.P \\"Love is Love\\" became a major hit in Japan. George also collaborated on the song \\"Electric Dreams\\", sung by P. P. Arnold. The song was written with Phil Pickett (former member of the 1970s band Sailor) who had also co-written \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and frequently played keyboards for the group. Despite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame.

Plot title: At the Circus Movie plot: A circus strongman named Goliath (Nat Pendleton) and the circus midget Little Professor Atom (Jerry Maren) are accomplices of the bad guy Carter (James Burke) who is trying to take over the circus. In the animal car, they knock Wilson (Kenny Baker) out and steal his 10,000 that Wilson plans to pay off various bankers. But they unintentionally leave a cigar as evidence.J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho Marx), a lawyer from New York, arrives to handle the situation over the stolen money. He suspects both Goliath and Professor Atom of being in cahoots with Carter. Loophole then teams up with con artist Antonio 'Tony' Pirelli (Chico Marx) along with carnie Punchy (Harpo Marx) to investigate.Loophole caves in when he sees the menacing Goliath, and gets nowhere with Little Professor Atom. (His attempts to get a cigar from Atom are foiled by the ditzy Tony). In Atom's mini-trailer, Loophole's attempts to ask for a cigar from Atom to compare it with the one at the crime scene are ruined when every time he asks for a cigar, Tony gives him one. When Punchy sneezes and knocks the furniture over in Atom's tiny room, the midget threatens to sue. Loophole, ever ready to solicit business, offers his card, (which Atom accepts!). In order to help Wilson, Loophole first tries to get the money from Carter's moll, Peerless Pauline (Eve Arden), but fails miserably.Then Loophole calls on socialite Mrs. Dukesbury (Margaret Dumont), and cons her into paying 10,000 for the Wilson Circus to entertain the Newport 400, instead of a performance by an orchestra conducted by a Frenchman named Jardinet (Fritz Feld). The \\"400 of Newport\\" are delighted with the circus; when Jardinet arrives, Loophole, who also delays Jardinet by implicating him in a \\"dope ring,\\" disposes of the Frenchman and his orchestra by having them play on a floating bandstand down at the water's edge.At the climax, Tony and Punchy cut the mooring rope and the musicians play the Prelude to Act Three of Lohengrin by Wagner, serenading the waves.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a word or name for pet lovers, especially dogs? Why is there so much anger about the Yulin Festival (a festival in which dogs are eaten)? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"A word or name for pet lovers, especially dogs, is \\"Cynophile.\\" Cynophile is derived from the Greek roots \\"kynos,\\" which means dog, and \\"philo,\\" which means to love or have a fondness for. Thus, a Cynophile is someone who appreciates, admires, and loves dogs, and might be particularly passionate about their well-being and care. Regarding the second question, there is much anger and controversy surrounding the Yulin Festival, which is held annually in Yulin, Guangxi, China, due to its association with the consumption of dog meat. Here are some reasons for the strong emotions linked to this festival: 1. Animal welfare concerns: Critics of the Yulin Festival argue that the conditions in which the dogs are kept before being slaughtered and the manner in which they are killed are inhumane. The dogs are often kept in cramped, unsanitary cages, lack access to proper food and water, and are not treated with the compassion that many believe they deserve. 2. Pet theft: There have been reports of dogs being stolen from their homes, taken off the streets, or procured through other illegal means to be sold and consumed during the festival. Naturally, this generates anger and concern among pet owners and animal lovers worldwide. 3. Cultural perceptions: In many Western countries, dogs are primarily viewed as companion animals rather than as food animals. This cultural difference causes some people in the West to perceive the consumption of dog meat as barbaric and cruel. These emotions are often exacerbated by the prevalence of social media, which helps to spread images and stories from the festival to a much wider audience. 4. Public health concerns: There are concerns that the consumption of dog meat can lead to the transmission of dangerous diseases, such as rabies. Some argue that the lack of regulation surrounding the handling, slaughtering, and preparation of dog meat during the Yulin Festival increases the risk of disease transmission and other health hazards. 5. Loss of global reputation: Critics argue that the Yulin Festival tarnishes China's international standing, as it causes significant outrage and casts a negative light on the country's treatment of animals. This has led to calls for boycotts and sanctions, further fueling the anger surrounding the festival. In response to your third question, the two initial questions are not the same. The first question is concerned with finding a word or name for those who love pets, particularly dogs. The second question explores the reasons behind the anger and controversy surrounding a specific festival in which dogs are consumed as a tradition. While both questions involve dogs, the focus and nature of the inquiries differ, as one is about affection for these animals, and the other is about the ethical and cultural implications of a specific event."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: What is the most common climate across Tennessee? A: Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a mountain temperate climate or a humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures. Does the answer correctly answer the question OPTIONS: --yes; --no;","completion":"Yes, the most common climate across Tennessee is a humid subtropical climate, with some exceptions in the higher elevations of the Appalachians where the climate is classified as mountain temperate or humid continental due to cooler temperatures. The humid subtropical climate in Tennessee is characterized by hot summers and mild to cool winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. The location of the state and its diverse topography play significant roles in shaping the climate of Tennessee. As part of the southeastern United States, the state is influenced by warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, which helps to maintain its humid subtropical climate. In this humid subtropical climate zone, the annual average temperature ranges from 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 21 degrees Celsius). Summer heat can often reach into the 90s Fahrenheit (32 to 37 degrees Celsius), while the temperature in winter months tends to hover around the freezing point or slightly higher. Precipitation is generally abundant, averaging 45-60 inches (1,140-1,520 mm) per year. Rainfall is relatively equally distributed throughout the year, although summer months are usually the wettest, and winter months can be more prone to snow and ice. The exceptions to this humid subtropical climate are found in the higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains in eastern Tennessee. In these areas, the climate is described as either mountain temperate or humid continental. The temperatures are typically cooler, with average annual temperatures ranging from 40 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 16 degrees Celsius). Winters can be significantly colder, and snowfall accumulations are generally higher. This variation in climate is influenced by the presence of the mountains, which act as a barrier and force the air to rise and cool as it moves over their slopes. The climate in Tennessee varies across the state due to its diverse topography, but the most common climate is a humid subtropical climate. This leads to generally hot summers and mild to cool winters, with ample precipitation throughout the year. In the higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains, mountain temperate and humid continental climates offer a departure from the state's dominant climate classification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \\" questionable utility. \\" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is. Question: The intended readers of the passage are _ .

The woman left the rice cooking on the stove but removed the beef because she didn't want the Options are: (a). rice to be undercooked.. (b). beef to be undercooked..","completion":"... (a). rice to be undercooked. Susana had always been very particular about how she cooked her meals. Her grandmother, Abuela Sofia, taught her the importance of patience and attention to detail when it came to perfecting the art of Latin American cuisine. From stewed beans and yucca to delectable homemade tamales, Susana was dedicated to learning and mastering the recipes that had been passed down through the generations in her family. One important lesson Abuela Sofia had instilled in her was the significance of properly cooked rice. \\"A perfect meal depends on a bed of perfect rice,\\" Abuela would say with a stern finger wag. So today, as she prepared a lovely dinner for her two eldest sons who were visiting from college, Susana made sure her rice was cooked to perfection. Her sons, Miguel and Alejandro, had been away studying at prestigious universities, pursuing ambitious career paths. Susana knew they missed the comforts of home, and that meant putting extra care into her dishes. The aroma of sautéed onions and green peppers already permeated the air, enticing the senses while the rice simmered gently on the stove. She decided to remove the beef for now. She didn't want it to overcook while the rice reached its ideal texture – tender and slightly sticky but with each individual grain remaining intact. Susana set the marinated beef aside, letting it rest for a few moments as she shifted her focus back to the rice. A practiced hand, she didn't need a timer to tell her when it would be ready. Instead, she relied on her senses and intuition, honed after years of experience in the kitchen. As the rice continued to cook, she began preparing a salad, incorporating fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocados, and even adding a hint of cilantro for a burst of flavor. The colors of the salad danced together, reminding her of the vibrant landscapes of her childhood in the small, bustling town outside of Mexico City that she and her grandmother called home. A sprinkle of lime juice and a dash of salt completed the dish, setting it aside as she returned to the rice pot. A final taste confirmed that the rice was indeed ready - fluffy, fragrant, and perfectly cooked. At long last, Susana added the beef back to the pan, allowing the flavors to meld and the meat to sizzle and brown deliciously. She stirred the contents of the pan gently, distributing the hearty chunks of beef evenly amongst the seasoned rice, creating a warm and comforting meal her sons could enjoy; one that would remind them of where they came from and of the love that had nurtured them. Miguel and Alejandro arrived just as Susana put the finishing touches on the meal. Their smiles grew wider and their eyes sparked with familiarity as they recognized the familiar scents of their mother's lovingly prepared meal. As they settled at the table, Susana joined them, beaming with pride and delight as they began digging in, savoring the flavors of home. The laughter and stories filled the air, and for Susana, she knew that all the attention to detail had paid off. Her perfect rice was not only the foundation of a delicious meal, but a bridge between the generations – a loving reminder of her Abuela's wisdom and a cherished bond that connected them all, always."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Cybersphere is a \`\` ball and paddle '' game similar to Arkanoid . The game and its sequel ( Cybersphere Plus ) have recently been released as freeware by the designer . It was designed by Clay Hellman and published by Psycon Software . Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work . - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights. - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader. - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls. - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks. - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a benefit and can be used at a time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND' in \\"Bubble Bobble\\". Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from \\"Pac-Man\\" (regarded as the first power-up) and the Super Mushroom from \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", which ranked first in UGO Networks' \\"Top 11 Video Game Powerups\\".

I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

Plot title: Home Alone 3 Movie plot: Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger, four internationally wanted hitmen working for a North Korean terrorist group, have stolen a US10 million missile cloaking computer chip. The thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip. Wondering what the thieves want with a remote control car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to someone. The thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him. As a snowstorm hits Chicago, the thieves block off the road to the house, and Alice duct tapes Hess to a chair in her garage and leaves the door open.

Step 1: Assess the condition of the carpet First, we closely examined the current carpet. The blue fibers were matted and stained, and a musty odor filled the room – it was clear that this carpet had seen better days. Step 2: Determine the budget for the project Next, we calculated our available budget for home improvement. We factored in the cost of materials and labor for both the carpet replacement and the potential hardwood floor installation. Ultimately, the cost of a new carpet was more within our budget, which reinforced our decision to go with a new carpet. Step 3: Choose a new carpet We browsed through various stores and catalogs to select the perfect new carpet. We considered factors such as color, texture, durability, and price. After a thorough search, we settled on a plush, stain-resistant carpet in a modern shade of blue. Step 4: Remove old carpet Hiring a professional contractor, we removed the old, dirty carpet from the room, taking care to properly dispose of it in an environmentally-friendly manner. Step 5: Prep the floor for the new carpet Before installing the new carpet, the contractor inspected the subfloor for any damage or irregularities. A sturdy and even subfloor is essential for the longevity of the new carpet. Step 6: Install the new carpet The contractor expertly installed the plush new carpet, meticulously attending to every detail, from laying the carpet padding to carefully trimming and tucking the edges. Step 7: Add finishing touches Once the carpet was installed, we placed our furniture back into the room, being mindful of the carpet's color and texture. To protect the new carpet from damage, we strategically placed rugs and mats in high-traffic areas.

Problem: Solve -84*m = -73*m - 22 for m. And the answer is...","completion":"Alright, let's find out what 'm' is! First, let's simplify the equation down by getting all the 'm's on one side. So, let's grab 73 'm's from the right side and move them to the left side where the -84 'm' is! When we move things in math, they kind of do a flip - so -73 'm's become 73 'm's on the left side. So, our equation becomes -84m + 73m = -22. Now, if we combine -84m and 73m, it's sort of like having -84 apples and you add 73 apples. You're still going to have -11 apples. So, our equation becomes -11m = -22. To get 'm' by itself now, we need to do the opposite of multiplication which is division! What's happening here is -11 multiplied by 'm'. To undo that, we need to divide each side by -11. So we get m = -22 / -11. A negative divided by a negative makes a positive, so when we calculate -22 divided by -11, we get 2. So, our answer is, 'm' equals 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Movie plot title: Persona Movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son. Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancÃ©, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition â \\"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her.

Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers.

Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia. Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance.

It is the language of international business, research, and science. More than three-fourths of the world's mail is written in English. More than half of the scientific research journals are in English. Most other languages have borrowed many English words. Why did English become the international language? In the middle of the nineteenth century, French was the international language. The Britain became very powerful in the world. England started colonies in North America and India in the seventeenth century. By 1900 England also had colonies in other parts of Asia, Africa and the South Pacific. The people in the colonies had to use English. Slowly it became more important than French internationally. After the Second World War, the United States became very powerful, and even more people began to learn English. Is English a good international language? It has more words than any other language. The grammar is simpler than in other major languages. However, English spelling is difficult. Foreigners all have trouble spelling English. So do native speakers! Since 1880, people have invented over fifty artificial (not natural) languages. No one speaks them as a native language. However, none of them has ever become popular. Some people don't want to study English, but it is the international language. There is no way to change that now. Question: English is the native language of _ .

On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Ok So good\\" Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to provide a quantitative rating without more context, but based on the limited information provided in the review of \\"Ok So good,\\" I would give it a 3 out of 5. Here's a breakdown of my reasoning: 1. Brevity: The review is quite brief, with only three words. It lacks detail, which can be a crucial aspect for potential consumers trying to make an informed decision about a product or service. A more comprehensive review would address specific attributes, describe overall experience, or mention any standout features or drawbacks. 2. Ambiguity: The phrase \\"Ok So good\\" is somewhat ambiguous. The use of \\"Ok\\" can imply that the reviewer finds the product or service to be adequate but not exceptional. In contrast, \\"So good\\" suggests that they had a more positive experience. Potential consumers may be unsure if the reviewer's experience was average or above average. 3. Grammar/Spelling: No significant grammar or spelling errors were made in this review, but the sentence structure is somewhat unclear. The reviewer might have intended to use the phrase \\"Ok, so good\\" (with a comma) or \\"Okay, so it's good\\" to show the connection between the two statements. Proper punctuation usage can help eliminate confusion and provide a clearer understanding of the intended message. 4. Positivity: Despite its brevity and ambiguity, the review has a generally positive tone, which can encourage potential consumers to view the product or service in a favorable light. Emphasizing positive experiences is an essential aspect of reviews, as they can significantly influence purchasing decisions. In conclusion, while this review does convey a generally positive sentiment, it lacks the detail necessary for potential consumers to make an informed decision about the product or service. A more well-rounded and comprehensive review would provide specifics about the reviewer's experience, discuss standout features or drawbacks, and present clear, well-constructed sentences and thoughts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican David Jolly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday's special election in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. Young, first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest-serving Republican in the House. With national Republicans framing the race as a referendum on Obamacare and a massive infusion of outside ad money to try to influence the outcome, pundits have looked to the Florida race as a bellwether for November's midterm elections. With Jolly's win keeping the House seat in GOP hands, the OPTIONS: - Alex Sink still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Bill Young still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - CNN still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Congress still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Congressional District still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - David Jolly still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Democrats still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Florida still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - GOP still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - House still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Jolly still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Massachusetts still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Obamacare still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Republican still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Republicans still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - St. Petersburg still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - U.S. Senate still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. - Young still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber.","completion":"- Democrats still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. The correct answer is that the Democrats still need to win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber.

The question is about the balance of political power in the chamber, which is determined by the number of seats held by each party.

Given the question: Like many other inventors before him, professor Slawomir Suwak designed only the things he needed himself. He had several patents on his conscience already: an automatic cork opener for wine in the indicative state, a portable set of board games for solving personality problems, a wallet with a mini-device for the duplications of 100 zloty bills, and a piece of equipment \\"the day after\\" used to irretrievably eliminate from the time-space continuum days burdened with a hangover. Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood. Professor Suwak called his new baby \\"mini-anti-aggressor.\\" The McPhilips corporation expressed its interest in the product early on, even when it was still at the drawing-board stage. The company partially financed the purchase of sub-assembly elements from its subsidiary specializing in the productions of components for technologically advanced products.

Premise: LRI showcases a variety of original and effective activities ranging from how to conduct a comprehensive strategic planning process to new ideas for serving hard-to-reach populations. Hypothesis: LRI showcases a new strategy to process new ideas. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first break down the individual elements of both statements and then examine their logical connections. Premise: - LRI showcases a variety of original and effective activities. - These activities range from conducting comprehensive strategic planning processes to new ideas for serving hard-to-reach populations. Hypothesis: - LRI showcases a new strategy to process new ideas. Now, let's analyze the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis. 1. Variety of original and effective activities: The premise states that LRI showcases a range of different activities that are both original and effective. This indicates that LRI is involved in generating and presenting new and efficient approaches. 2. Comprehensive strategic planning process: The premise specifies that one of the areas LRI covers is the strategic planning process, which focuses on developing and executing a thoughtful plan to achieve organizational objectives. 3. New ideas for serving hard-to-reach populations: In addition to strategic planning, the premise also highlights LRI's involvement in generating new ideas aimed at catering to underserved or difficult-to-reach communities. Now, let's compare these points with the hypothesis: 1. Showcases a new strategy: The hypothesis states that LRI demonstrates a new approach, which matches the premise's description of LRI showcasing original and effective activities. 2. Process new ideas: The hypothesis mentions that the new strategy concerns processing new ideas. This aspect can be related to the premise, since LRI focuses on innovative solutions, such as strategic planning and reaching underserved populations. In summary, the premise entails the hypothesis to some extent, as it indicates that LRI showcases original and effective activities, including new ideas for serving hard-to-reach populations. The premise doesn't directly mention the new strategy for processing ideas as the hypothesis does, but it describes a range of various activities that can be correlated to the generation and processing of new ideas. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if LRI is showcasing original and effective activities in these areas, it may also be implementing new strategies to process new ideas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

In a world where humans and wildlife can rarely interact without external intervention, this heartwarming story of a curious fox and the surprise spotlight it found itself under teaches us important lessons about the treasures of nature and the wonders that spontaneity can provide. Encounter with Wildlife Michaela Walch is an adventurer by nature, and it was on a trip to the pristine wilderness of Canada's North West that her life intertwined with that of a clever fox. At her campsite, which she was using as her temporary home while exploring the area, Michaela decided to leave her camera unattended on a makeshift tripod. Little did she know that her absence would provide the perfect opportunity for an unforeseen visitor to take center stage. While she was away, enjoying the splendor of the Canadian landscape, a curious fox approached the campsite cautiously, intrigued by the presence of this unfamiliar piece of technology. The Allure of the Unattended Camera The fox, by nature an inquisitive animal, couldn't resist the temptation to inspect the camera up close. As it delicately approached, it was evident that its curiosity was piqued by the camera's unusual presence in its natural habitat. What had likely started as the fox simply wanting to examine this peculiar object soon became a once-in-a-lifetime photoshoot, all thanks to its bold and playful spirit. Taking Over the Photoshoot As the fox neared the camera, it unintentionally triggered the gadget's shutter release, thus capturing numerous snapshots of itself as it explored the foreign object. From candid, inquisitive looks to adorable poses showcasing its fluffy fur, the fox provided Michaela with a series of breathtaking photographs – a truly remarkable keepsake! Upon returning to her campsite, Michaela couldn't have anticipated the delightful surprise awaiting her. While reviewing the images on her camera, she discovered an entire photoshoot featuring her elusive guest. Both excited and amused by this unexpected turn of events, she was left in awe of the striking beauty that the natural world had captured on her camera. The Sneaky Fox's Legacy Stories like that of Michaela Walch and the sneaky fox are beautiful reminders of the powerful, yet often unexpected connection between humans, technology, and wildlife. This unlikely encounter resulted in a myriad of incredible photos that not only enriched Michaela's personal journey but also provided her with an unmatched glimpse into the life of a wild creature. Final Thoughts In an age where technology often keeps us removed from the allure of the natural world, Michaela Walch's incredible experience teaches us that when given the chance, even the most ordinary items can lead to incidents that blur the line between the human and animal realms, sparking awe and fascination in the process. The sneaky fox's Canadian photoshoot serves as a testament to the beauty that can be found when we least expect it – a heartwarming reminder that the wonders of wildlife are always just around the corner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The nearest airport to Bozel is Chambery Airport (also known as Chambery-Savoie Mont Blanc Airport) which is around 104 kilometers away or approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes by car. Chambery Airport has seasonal flights to various European destinations and is mostly active during the winter months due to ski tourism. Other nearby airports include: 1. Geneva International Airport (Cointrin Airport) - Located about 140 kilometers from Bozel, or about a 2-hour drive away. Geneva Airport is well connected to numerous international destinations, so it might be more convenient for travelers coming from outside of Europe. 2. Lyon-Saint Exupery Airport - Situated approximately 183 kilometers from Bozel, or around a 2-hour and 30-minute drive. Lyon Airport is a major transport hub, offering many domestic and international flight connections. 3.

Matt studied protozoa, while his friend Greg studied nematodes and insects. But I can use this background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. What is an answer for this question: Which friend studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check? Answer:","completion":"Answer: Matt is the friend who studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check. Justification: In the given information, it is mentioned that Matt studied protozoa.

As a result, the kidneys lose much of their ability to filter blood. This is called kidney failure . The only cure for kidney failure is a kidney transplant, but it can be treated with dialysis. Dialysis is a medical procedure in which blood is filtered through a machine (see Figure below ). Q: What is a popular treatment for kidney failure? A: The answer is:","completion":"Dialysis is a popular treatment for kidney failure. Dialysis is a therapeutic procedure conducted in a clinic or hospital under the supervision of healthcare professionals. It comprises a high-efficiency filtering process that replicates many of the kidneys' natural functions. This treatment is required when the kidneys are no longer able to adequately filter the blood to remove waste and harmful toxins. There are two primary types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves circulating the patient's blood out of the body and into an external machine known as a dialyzer or \\"artificial kidney.\\" This machine has a specialized filter that aids in the removal of waste products such as urea, creatinine, and any excess water from the blood. The filtered blood is then returned to the patient's body. This method commonly happens several times a week and can take several hours. On the other hand, peritoneal dialysis uses the patient's own peritoneum within the abdomen as a semipermeable membrane. Here, a fluid called dialysate is infused into the peritoneal cavity and then drained after a specified period, carrying waste products with it. This can often be performed by the patient at home, either manually several times a day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) or assisted by a machine usually overnight (automated peritoneal dialysis). Both methods help reduce the harmful impacts of kidney failure, lowering the concentration of harmful toxins in the blood, maintaining the body's delicate balance of electrolytes, and preventing the build-up of excess water. This process alleviates the many symptoms associated with kidney failure, such as nausea, fatigue, and swelling. While dialysis is regarded as a leading treatment for kidney failure, it is not a cure. The only cure available for kidney failure as noted is a kidney transplant, which involves the surgical placement of a healthy kidney from a donor into the patient. This option is dependant on factors such as the patient's overall health condition, the availability of a suitable donor, and the patient's place on the transplant list. However, due to organ shortage or other health factors, not everyone is able to receive a transplant, making dialysis an essential process for many patients with kidney failure."},{"prompt":"Division 19 is an upcoming American dystopian thriller film directed and written by S.A.

Would \\"Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"While the statement \\"Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon\\" is an accurate description of the chemical composition of benzene, it does not necessarily address the primary question about its uses. Instead, let me provide a detailed and long answer to the question \\"What is benzene used for?\\". Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a hexagonal ring structure composed of carbon atoms, each of which is bonded to a single hydrogen atom. It has a variety of industrial, commercial, and scientific applications, and its significance is attributed to its unique chemical properties, which include high stability, strong reactivity, and solubility in organic solvents. Here are some of the primary uses for benzene: 1. Production of intermediates in the synthesis of other chemicals: One of the most important uses of benzene is as a building block for the production of several industrial chemicals. Some examples of these chemicals include: a. Ethylbenzene: This is used to make styrene, which is a key component in the production of polystyrene (a common plastic material). b. Cumene: This substance is used to produce phenol and acetone, both of which have numerous industrial applications. c. Cyclohexane: This is an essential ingredient in the production of nylon, a widely-used synthetic material. d. Nitrobenzene: An intermediate in the production of aniline, which is used in the synthesis of dyes, rubber chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 2. Solvent: Benzene is a highly effective solvent for many organic compounds, allowing it to dissolve fats, oils, waxes, resins, and other materials. It is used in the manufacturing of paints, adhesives, rubber, and lubricants. However, due to its toxic nature, benzene is being replaced in many applications by less hazardous solvents such as toluene and xylene. 3. Laboratory applications: In addition to its industrial uses, benzene is used in scientific research and laboratory applications. It is used as a reference and calibration substance for various analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, due to its well-known molecular structure and solubility. 4. Fuel component: Benzene can be found as a trace component in petrol (gasoline) and is a natural part of crude oil. While it has been largely phased out from gasoline formulations in many countries due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties, it may still be present in small amounts. It is important to note that the uses of benzene have been restricted in recent years due to its hazardous nature. Benzene is classified as a carcinogen, and exposure to high levels of benzene can cause serious health effects, such as respiratory problems, blood disorders, and an increased risk of cancer. As a result, many countries have implemented strict guidelines and regulations to limit benzene exposure in industrial and consumer products, and numerous efforts have been made to find safer alternatives to benzene in various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Într-adevăr, proximitatea inversării piramidei vârstelor - ca urmare a schimbărilor demografice provocate de longevitatea crescută a populației - amenință viabilitatea financiară a sistemelor de pensii. Translate to English","completion":"Indeed, the impending inversion of the age pyramid - as a result of the demographic shifts caused by the increased longevity of the population - threatens the financial viability of pension systems. In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in life expectancy, and this, coupled with declining birth rates, has resulted in a change in the demographic structure of many countries. Simply put, we are experiencing an aging population. As the number of retired people increases, the number of working people decreases, creating an inverted age pyramid. This demographic shift poses serious challenges to the financial sustainability of pension systems around the world. The current design of many pension systems, known as the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model, relies on a balance between the young working population and the elderly retired population. Workers contribute to the pension system through taxes and social security payments, which are then used to provide income for retired individuals. As the proportion of elderly people in the population increases, the burden on the remaining workers becomes greater, leading to potential financial strain on this system. There are several potential consequences of this demographic change on pension systems. Firstly, with fewer workers supporting a larger retired population, the amount of benefits provided to retirees might have to be reduced. This could lead to a lower standard of living for the elderly and, in some cases, even poverty. Secondly, governments might have to increase taxes or social security contributions to sustain the pension system, which could put more strain on the working population and might alienate younger generations who feel that they are bearing the brunt of this demographic shift. Alternatively, governments might need to borrow to fund pension payments, which could contribute to higher public debt levels and potentially compromise fiscal stability. To counteract these issues, many governments have already begun implementing policy changes and reforms to their pension systems. These actions can include raising the retirement age to better align with increasing life expectancies, encouraging private pension savings, and redesigning pension schemes to make them more financially sustainable. Overall, the inversion of the age pyramid due to increased longevity of the population poses a significant challenge to the viability of pension systems worldwide. To ensure that these systems remain sustainable, governments and policymakers must adopt forward-thinking strategies and implement effective pension reforms that balance the needs of current retirees and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning? from the following article ? As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.","completion":"The name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning, as mentioned in the article, is Harvey.

In this situation, Ash would most likely feel like they were trusted by their peers within the group. Jesse taking Ash at Austin's word signifies a strong sense of trust and belief within the group dynamics. Trust is a crucial element in any relationship, be it personal or professional, and having this trust within the group contributes to a stronger bond, open communication, and increased collaboration. By taking Ash at Austin’s word, Jesse demonstrates that they value Ash’s opinions and hold them in high esteem. This level of trust could drive Ash to feel more confident, comfortable sharing their thoughts, and motivated to contribute actively to the group’s goals. Jesse’s actions would have shown Ash that being genuine and sincere is appreciated within the group. On the other hand, if Ash had felt either a lack of loyalty (option a) or betrayal (option c), it would imply that there was a clear breakdown of trust between group members. In this case, Ash would likely feel insecure, guarded, and skeptical about the group’s dynamics, leading to hesitance in sharing ideas or participating in decision-making.

Garstang is famous for being the world's first ever Fairtrade Town. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The Fair Trade Towns campaign is the result of a grass-roots citizens movement that started in the UK in 2001 (see below). It allows citizens to get together in order to self-proclaim their town (or other local geographical area) as a region that complies with a few general Fair Trade criteria, that can be adapted from country to country but which retain their main elements. - Lancashire (; archaically the County Palatine of Lancaster; abbreviated Lancs.) is a non-metropolitan ceremonial county in north west England.

The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Cabus is a village and civil parish in Lancashire, England.

Questions: If I am reading a letter from a friend who I asked to write me a response, what might I be looking for? Options: - get news - envelope - happiness - though - answer Answer:","completion":"When you are reading a letter from a friend whom you asked to write you a response, you might be looking for an answer as well as other elements from the given options. Let's discuss each option in detail: 1. Get news: It is quite common to receive and exchange news from friends through letters, especially when there is a question or issue that needs to be addressed. By reading the letter, you might learn about your friend's recent experiences, significant events, or any updates in their lives. 2. Envelope: Though the envelope is a part of the overall communication process as it holds and protects the letter, it is not something you would specifically look for when reading the letter. Instead, the envelope has already served its function by helping deliver the message safely. 3. Happiness: Reading a letter from a friend may bring you happiness, as it demonstrates the connection and the bond shared between you two. This option may not directly address the question asked, but it could be an emotional outcome of the interaction. 4. Though: This option seems to be a typographical error, as \\"though\\" is a conjunction often used in writing to connect contrasting ideas. It does not add any relevant or specific context to the question of what you might be looking for when reading a letter from your friend. 5. Answer: When writing to a friend with a specific question or request for a response, the primary purpose of reading the reply letter is to find the answer to that question or query. It allows you to understand your friend's thoughts, perspectives, or decisions associated with your initial message. In conclusion, when reading a letter from a friend who you asked to write a response, you would be primarily looking for an answer. However, getting news and experiencing happiness while reading the letter can be considered secondary outcomes or reasons for reading the letter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Based on the review provided by the customer, it appears that he is satisfied with the product. The review is quite positive and indicates the recipient's pleasure with the item. Here's the breakdown: 1. \\"My brother loved it.\\" - This is a strong statement implying that the receiver, the customer's brother, thoroughly enjoyed what he received, which in this context is the movie \\"Aliens.\\" 'Loved' is a strong word often used to express high levels of satisfaction and enjoyment, implying a positive experience with the product. 2. \\"He already has the first Alien movie.\\" - This sentence suggests that the brother is a fan of the Alien franchise as he already owns the first movie. Therefore, it can be implied that receiving the sequel (or another installment) would have been satisfying for him. 3. \\"This is one of his favorite movies.\\" - This sentence further reinforces the notion of satisfaction. Declaring something as a 'favorite' often involves serious enjoyment and satisfaction from it. If \\"Aliens\\" is one of his favorite movies, it indicates that he holds it in high regard, hence signifying his satisfaction with the product. 4. \\"Thank you.\\" - The reviewer thanks at the end, which generally indicates a sense of gratitude or satisfaction with a service or product. Therefore, taking all these points into consideration, we can deduce that the customer was undoubtedly satisfied with the product - the movie \\"Aliens.

Besides, it is useful to do morning exercises. Secondly, early rising helps us in our studies. In the morning we learn more quickly and find it easier to understand what we learn. Thirdly, early rising can give us a plan of our work for the day. We cannot work well without a good plan.

Product review: This is a major revision of the VB5 edition of the book: Peter Wright has rewritten two chapters to clarify them, and added several more to extend the explanation of the design process and how to turn design into code, as well as delve more into inheritance under VB.These changes make this the best introductory book on Visual Basic Objects currently on the market. Wright's style is easy to read, his sense of humor apparent, and he has good grasp of his material and covers it well. The topics are appropriate for a book at this level, although, like most popular textbooks today, they are sometimes covered too simplistically (the chapter on Active X components comes to mind as does the discussion of interface inheritance).Beginning Visual Basic 6 Objects will serve as a spring board for those who want to go on to more advanced books such as Lhotka's Visual Basic 6 Business Objects.

What will happen after I die? What happen when we die? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you've asked are related, but they are not exactly the same. The first question, \\"What will happen after I die?\\" is more specific to the individual asking the question, while the second question, \\"What happens when we die?\\" is more general and refers to the human experience as a whole. Both questions deal with the concept of human mortality, but from different perspectives. Now, let's elaborate on each of the questions. 1) What will happen after I die? This question pertains to the personal journey of an individual after their physical death, and can be explored from various viewpoints, such as theological, scientific, and philosophical. A. Theological Perspectives: Different religions have different beliefs about what happens to an individual after they die. Some common ideas include: - Christianity: Belief in an eternal soul that will be judged and allowed into Heaven or Hell based on their actions during their lifetime. - Hinduism: The concept of reincarnation, where a person's soul is reborn into a different body based on their Karma (actions) from their past lives. - Buddhism: Similar to Hinduism, Buddhism also believes in the cycle of death and rebirth known as Samsara, which continues until an individual reaches Enlightenment or Nirvana. B. Scientific Perspectives: From a scientific standpoint, when a person dies, their physical body ceases to function. The heart stops pumping blood, and the brain's electrical activity ceases. Once a person is declared dead, their body undergoes the process of decomposition, in which it is broken down by natural processes and absorbed back into the ecosystem. C. Philosophical Perspectives: There are various philosophical viewpoints that address the question of what happens after death. Some philosophers argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, and thus concludes with the death of the individual. Others propose theories such as panpsychism, suggesting that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, and might continue after death in some form. 2) What happens when we die? This question addresses the general experience of death from the perspective of humanity as a whole. A. Theological Perspectives: Similar to the individual experience, cultural beliefs and religious teachings often dictate how people understand what happens when we die. The concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and judgement may continue to persist, providing varying perspectives on the human experience of death. B. Scientific Perspectives: The biological process of death is consistent across all humans. As mentioned earlier, the heart stops beating, the brain activity ceases, and the body eventually decomposes and returns to the ecosystem. Regardless of personal beliefs, the scientific aspects of death remain constant. C. Societal Perspectives: When a person dies, the impact is not limited to their individual experience; it extends to their family, friends, and community. People come together to mourn, remember, and honor the deceased through funerals, memorials, and other cultural rituals. The memory and legacy of the individual continue through the stories and connections they shared with the living. In conclusion, both questions revolve around the concept of death, but they are framed differently. One focuses on the individual's experience post-mortem, while the other looks at the general phenomenon of human death. From theological, scientific, philosophical, and societal points of view, the answers can vary greatly. Ultimately, one's understanding of what happens after death largely depends on their personal beliefs and cultural context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Rinchich owed 268 from a previous visit: She didn't have the money and the doctor refused to see her until she paid. Pamela Rinchich, with husband Jim, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after being laid off. \\"I offered to do whatever I could, even work in the office to cover it,\\" said Rinchich, with tears in her eyes. Just a few months earlier, life was going great for Rinchich. She was planning a wedding with her fiancé, Jim, and she had a good job as a supervisor at the Honeywell plant in Sarasota, Florida.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The first scene shows Matthew Stewart digging a grave for Grace Trevethyn's husband, John (Bill Weston), who has committed suicide. His now widow, Grace (Brenda Blethyn), an English woman living on a beautiful large estate, learns, upon his death, that John's debts had mounted to the point that her assets (home, car, garden) will soon be repossessed. The postman (Bill Hallet) keeps on bringing her more threatening letters from banks, credit cards... and he also tells all the townspeople about her problems. One of John and Grace's friends, Dr. Martin Bamford (Martin Clunes) tells her that everybody knew more or less that John was doing something fishy financially, but nobody wanted to interfere in his business. With desperation, Grace realises that all commercial schemes by her late husband were failures, and that they even had a secret account in Sweden, but with nothing in it.With no assets of note and no source of income, she watches helplessly as the process begins, and when her high-tech state-of-the-art lawnmower is taken away by some movers (led by Johnny Bamford), she must fire her gardener, Matthew Stewart (Craig Ferguson), to whom she is close. When she stumbles upon the fact that Matthew is not having much success growing some weed plants in the fields of the local vicarage because of the lack of sunlight and heat, feeling awful about having fired him, she suggests that he move his plants to her greenhouse.The plants begin to grow impressively, and Grace, quite innocently, asks Matthew what the plants are worth. The news that they are illegal marijuana plants that are quite valuable on the open market gives Grace an idea, one that might just save her from having her estate repossessed by the bank. Mass production of marijuana plants begins in Grace's greenhouse. Matthew's girlfriend, hard-working fishing boat captain Nicky Tristan (Valerie Edmond) wants no part of the plan. She wants Matthew to grow up, settle down and start taking responsibility for his own life. Some of the locals suspect what is going on, but, compassionately, stay out of Grace's way. In fact, some of them have the notion of watching the neon lights coming from the conservatory every night, as though it was some kind of show.Of course, somebody will have to go to London to line up a buyer for the marijuana. Matthew, a marijuana user and a man in his thirties is the logical candidate, but unbeknownst to him, his girlfriend is pregnant. Knowing of the pregnancy, and not wanting Matthew to leave the side of his girl, Grace insists that she be the one to go to London. Her escapade into the lowest depths of the London drug subculture is hilarious, and at first it looks like she is going to fail. However, suave and savvy Jacques Chevalier (Tchéky Karyo, more handsome than ever) eventually contacts her. He smooth-talks her into doing business.Authorities become aware of the drugs on her estate because of the flying saucer-like lights which the greenhouse now emits. Local police officer Sgt. Alfred Mabely (Ken Campbell) has let things be, as he thought she was cultivating just a small quanitity of weed for her own personal use and that she needed it to cope with all the debts and stress. But when he realises that it's a huge quantity, he has to get involved and investigate the matter.Grace has little choice but to destroy her own inventory. However, as the marijuana plants are not completely dry, they produce such a huge quantity of smoke that Grace, Matthew, the posh visiting ladies (Phillida Law, Linda Kerr Scott, Denise Coffey) who didn't wait for Grace to appear to make themselves some tea, and even the police officers -including Mabely - get high. The scene leaves with everybody jumping, dancing and caressing happily in the garden while naked.In a strange twist of fate, however, Grace writes a book describing her remarkable experience called The Joint Venture. The novel becomes a best seller, and, suddenly, her financial worries are over. She has to travel again to London to receive an award won by her novel, while all the townsfolk look at her on TV. Now we come to realise that Grace and Jacques are a couple, that he has left London for her small town and he strongly denies to some journalists that he ever got involved with any kind of drug.

Its intricate details and almost lifelike expressions intrigued him, but at the same time, he sensed an unusual energy that made him feel uneasy. Mr. Jenkins initially dismissed the unsettling feeling as he had a busy day ahead. The store was providing a haven for children and adults alike, and its reputable name stood strong in the community. Rows of vibrant toys, board games, and action figures lined the walls, creating a colorful tapestry that danced in the well-lit space. The sweet aroma of cotton candy and freshly popped popcorn filled the air as Mr. Jenkins greeted his loyal customers with a warm smile. It seemed like just another day at the toy store, until... The little antique doll began to have an increasingly powerful effect on Mr. Jenkins. It appeared where it shouldn't have been, as if it knew it was not meant to be displayed on the store shelves and was insisting on appearing in the most unexpected hideaways. Whenever the doll surfaced, a sudden chill would run down Mr. Jenkins' spine and a hushed silence would descend on the store. Growing increasingly concerned, Mr. Jenkins decided to take matters into his own hands and investigate the doll's history. After days of combing through the old records that came with the doll, he stumbled upon a faded letter tucked deep within. The letter told a harrowing tale of the doll's inception, revealing that it was crafted by a tormented artist. This artist was obsessed with achieving perfection and was rumored to be involved in dark arts. The artist had poured her suffering and struggles into the doll, ultimately binding a malevolent force within its delicate porcelain frame. As Mr. Jenkins unraveled the truth, it became abundantly clear that he could not sell such a dangerous item. Determined to rid the store of this menacing presence, he sought out the help of an eccentric psychic, Madame Zola. Together, they decided the best course of action would be a purification ritual involving sage, scattered salt, and ancient incantations passed down through generations of seers. On the night of the full moon, Madame Zola performed the ritual with utter precision. As she completed the ceremony, an eerie screech pierced the silence. The very air in the store quivered, as if releasing the oppressive energy that had been lurking in its depths. The doll, held firmly in Madame Zola's hands, lost its luster, and the once shimmering porcelain skin seemed to crack before their very eyes. Finally, the ritual came to its close, and the air was still once more. The two sighed, feeling lighter and freer than they had since the doll had entered their lives. With a nod of appreciation, Mr. Jenkins thanked Madame Zola for her help, knowing that his store was saved and the children who frequented the toy wonderland could do so once more in peace. The remnants of the broken porcelain shell seemed to whisper their own gratitude as Mr. Jenkins scooped them up, a testament to the toy store owner's unwavering dedication to the safety and joy of his young customers. The doll and its malevolent energy were gone forever, but the legend of the enchanted toy store lived on. Parents and children alike would remember the mysterious doll, its story becoming a cautionary tale told to curious souls who dared to dream of the toy store's supernatural past. As for Mr. Jenkins, he continued his ceaseless quest to bring joy and magic into every toy, forever vigilant of the power they could hold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lindsey made them feel less nervous and safe in the water.","completion":"Megan had always wanted to learn how to swim, and she figured there was no better time than the present to take on this new challenge. She knew ever since she was a child that swimming was a skill that she wanted to conquer, but something always seemed to stand in her way. As she grew older, her fear of water and the unknown submerged world beneath her became an intimidating reality. This fear, however, didn't stop her from trying to find someone who could help her overcome her trepidation and learn to swim. Megan confided her desire to learn how to swim in Lindsey – a talented swimmer who, over time, had become one of her close friends. Lindsey had years of experience in swimming, both recreationally and competitively. Megan knew that if anyone could teach her how to swim, it was Lindsey. Not wanting to lose this golden opportunity, Megan asked Lindsey for lessons, to which she happily agreed, excited to share her passion for swimming with her friend. As they set out on their first lesson, it was clear that Megan was nervous about getting into the water. The unknown elements that lay beneath the surface of the water made her heart race and her palms sweat. However, Lindsey was determined to make sure that her friend wouldn't be overcome with fear. Lindsey made Megan feel less nervous and safe in the water by first focusing on their comfort and trust in one another. Before venturing into the pool, Lindsey explained the basics of swimming, such as breathing techniques, body positioning, and the importance of relaxation when in water. Megan appreciated the time that Lindsey spent on the fundamentals, as it helped to build her confidence. To help Megan feel at ease, Lindsey held onto her friend's hand as they cautiously entered the water together. As they waded deeper, Lindsey's support never wavered. She maintained a calm and reassuring presence, periodically reminding Megan to let her body relax and remain confident in herself. Lindsey led Megan through a series of quick, shallow breaths, slowly submerging her face in the water, and then quickly raising it to take in air. Once Megan was comfortable with getting her face wet, Lindsey moved onto floating exercises. She showed Megan how to float on her back and stomach while supporting her body with her own hands. Throughout these exercises, Lindsey's encouraging words and guidance made Megan feel progressively more comfortable in the water. Gradually, Megan began to trust Lindsey and understand the delicate balance of being buoyant in water. Lindsey taught Megan how to kick and move her arms to propel herself forward. With Lindsey's unwavering support and competent instruction, Megan slowly started to conquer her fear of swimming. As the lessons progressed, so did Megan's abilities. Her confidence grew as she mastered each new skill. Lindsey had not only taught her how to swim but had also given her a new perspective on facing one's fears. The bond between the two friends had only grown stronger in the process. In conclusion, Lindsey made Megan feel less nervous and safe in the water, ultimately transforming her friend's experience from one filled with fear to an enjoyable adventure. Through patience, reassurance, and expert guidance, Megan learned to swim, trust in herself, and embrace the unknown – forever grateful to Lindsey for helping her achieve this lifelong goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Question: \\"What was the name of the small volcanic archipelago that Zarco happened upon?\\" Response: \\"Madeira\\" Possible answers: 1). no. 2). yes. Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"2). yes. The response correctly answers the question. The text states that João Gonçalves Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago, which he subsequently named Madeira.

Context: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Here is a hypothesis: It is advised to do the walk with a large group for security reasons. Here are the options: pick from the following. A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"A). Yes The hypothesis directly relates back to the premise. According to the premise, it states that for security reasons, one should undertake the 40-minute uphill walk to the monastery only with a large group or part of an organized tour. The hypothesis then states that it is advised to do the walk with a large group for security reasons. Comparing the two, the hypothesis is effectively a part of the premise. The premise offers two ways to handle the security reasons: going in a large group or being part of an organized tour. The hypothesis simply refines the premise to only include one of those methods—the method of being part of a large group. So, it aligns with the premise's message regarding upholding security measures during the walk. Therefore, if the premise is true and accurate, the hypothesis would be too, as it falls under the same conditions and message outlined in the premise. The premise and hypothesis don't contradict each other, but instead, they share the same ideology about group security during the 40-minute uphill walk to the monastery.

A screwdriver is a tool for driving screws and bolts. It doesn't typically function as a tool for breaking apart pans or crayons. It’s not impossible to use a screwdriver to break things apart, but it is not its intended use. Option by option analysis: 1. Breaking apart a pan: While it might be possible to pry apart a poorly constructed pan with a screwdriver, in general, pans are made of strong materials like steel or aluminum that are too durable for a screwdriver to simply break them apart. So, this is an unlikely scenario. 2. Breaking apart a crayon: This seems more plausible. Crayons are made of wax, which is much softer and easier to break apart. If one were to use enough force, a screwdriver could effectively split a crayon into smaller parts. So, based on the available options and the typical use of a screwdriver, a screwdriver could be used to break apart a crayon more feasibly than breaking apart a pan.

They say that Paris will become \\"a green capital of bikes\\" and they plan to park 20,000 bicycles at 1,600 stations. Paris created this plan to improve the city traffic environment and reduce the waste gas displacement . At a rental station, you only have to put your credit card into the machine to rent a bike. It provides French, German, English and Chinese services. If you ride the bike for only 30 minutes to relax, you needn't pay for it. A two-hour bike rent only costs you 4 euros. These stations work for 24 hours every day, so a bike is rented for 10 to 14 times a day. In this way there are 200,000 people using bikes a day, In the past few years, Paris has encouraged its people to ride bikes, but something unhappy has happened now and then. Some people break the traffic rules during rush hours. Some park their bikes everywhere. So how to park bikes is a problem that Paris will face. But this project is still a helpful way to improve its traffic environment. Don't you think so? Question: The machine at a bicycle rental system offers _ language services.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: \\"The Dark Secrets of Stoke Mandeville Hospital Revealed: The Horrors of Jimmy Savile's Abuse\\" Article: A handwritten letter discovered recently sheds new light on the infamous activities of the now-deceased and disgraced celebrity, Jimmy Savile. The letter, written on Stoke Mandeville Hospital's head paper, offered chilling new insights into the reach and breadth of Savile's actions. Found on official hospital paper, the scrawled note brusquely requests, \\"'BBC security friends please admit these three ladies to my room, ta.\\" The flippant inclusion of 'ta', British slang for 'thank you', underscores the unsettling nonchalance with which Savile approached this brazen abuse of authority and status. More shocking still, the letter was signed with Savile's unique signature, in which a smiling face was always incorporated within the 'J' of his first name, indicating the entertainer's need to stamp his personalized and jovially perverse branding onto each act of manipulation and control. With this new evidence in hand, it is believed strongly that a significant number of Savile's abuses took place within the premises of the BBC, facilitated by his manipulation of hospital and corporation resources. His 'BBC security friends' as he nonchalantly refers to them, are now suspected of playing a much more active role in enabling Savile's illicit activities, underscoring a systemic failure to protect the vulnerable from the likes of him. While investigations into the depth, extent and complicity of Savile's heinous crimes continue, what is clear is that the disgraced celebrity used the cover of his public persona, his status at the BBC, and his access to resources at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, to carry out his widespread abuse with impunity. The scrawled letter only emphasizes Savile’s blatant exploitation of these resources and the perceived safety of these institutions, routinely breached by his malicious conduct. This revelation further tarnishes the legacy of Jimmy Savile, once a national treasure, now remembered as a reviled paedophile who managed to escape justice during his lifetime. It serves as a harsh reminder of how the powerful can abuse their status, turning institutions meant to heal and inform into personal hunting grounds. As we pursue truth and justice for Savile's numerous victims, we must not lose sight of the urgent need for systemic reforms to prevent such abuses in the future. This starts with greater transparency and accountability within all facets of our institutions; be they hospitals, media corporations, or others. The smiling face in the 'J', it seems, veils far too many grim secrets that serve as solemn lessons for all of us.

Plot title: Father Goose Movie plot: It's 1942, and the war in the Pacific is not going well for the Allies. At the moment, the Australians are evacuating the island of Salamaua, taking what they can and destroying the rest. In all the confusion, scruffy beachcomber Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) arrives, ties his launch to the pier and begins helping himself to cans of Australian Navy petrol.A young officer, Stebbings (Jack Good), spots him and indignantly asks what he's doing. Walter pauses long enough to look at Stebbings, and say, portentously, \\"Do you know who I am?\\" Taken aback, Stebbings admits, \\"Well, no, I don't.\\" \\"Well...we'll let it go this time,\\" says Walter, magnanimously, and resumes stacking cans by his boat.In the harbormaster's office, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) is talking on the radio to the admiral, reassuring him that everything will go as planned. Stebbings bursts in and asks if Frank knows the cheeky Yank at the far end of the pier. Frank motions him to hush, then tells the admiral that yes, all the coast watcher positions have been assigned...all except for Matalava. But at that moment, Frank catches sight of Walter and his face brightens. He tells the admiral he has found his man for Matalava. As they walk down the pier, Frank tells Stebbings that Walter is a hard-drinking drop-out from civilization, but he knows the islands like the back of his hand and is as sharp as they come.Frank and Walter greet each other in a way that suggests they share a certain amount of history. Frank explains the coast watching service to Walter, and asks him to go Matalava, just for a while...until they can find someone permanent. Walter cheerfully refuses. Frank immediately turns to Stebbings and orders him to confiscate all the small boats on the pier (although Walter's is obviously the only one). At first Walter protests, but he soon realizes Frank will indeed follow through on confiscating the launch, so he cheerfully agrees to go to Matalava. Frank is not fooled.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There are many colours in nature. But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose land was acquired? ? In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west. The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.

Step 2: Combine like terms We can combine the terms with the variable u on the left side of the equation to simplify it. 3*u - u = 2*u (since 3 - 1 = 2) So the simplified equation is 2*u = -6. Step 3: Solve for u Now, we need to isolate the variable u to solve for it. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 2. 2*u/2 = -6/2 u = -3 Step 4: Check the solution Now let's check our solution by plugging it back into the original equation and determine if both sides are equal: 3*(-3) - (-3) = -6 -9 + 3 = -6 -6 = -6 The solution is correct, as both sides are equal.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Experienced physical body builders call this piling, as well as if you don’& rsquo; t pick your stack carefully, some of the products can cancel each various other out, or when taken together could give you also considerably of one active ingredient, and not nearly enough of an additional. Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"Bodybuilders often use a practice known as \\"stacking\\" to optimize their physical development. This approach combines the use of various supplements, hormones, and other substances to maximize growth and performance in their workouts. It is essential, however, to choose the stack components carefully, as using the wrong combination or poorly balanced dosages can lead to issues such as product cancellation and ingredient imbalance. In stacking, bodybuilders aim to utilize different products with synergistic effects, meaning that when combined, these products create a greater impact than if they were used individually. Each element in the stack works together to create a combined result, boosting the bodybuilding experience and leading to better overall muscle gains, endurance, and recovery. The primary purpose of stacking is to take advantage of the unique properties of multiple products, enabling a bodybuilder to achieve their goals quickly. Stacking can be done with natural supplements, performance-enhancing drugs, or a combination of both. However, a potential downside to stacking is that some combinations can cause problems if not adequately balanced in terms of dosage, timing, and function. For instance, when certain supplements are taken together, they may neutralize each other's effects or compete for the same receptors in the body. This cancellation can lead to suboptimal results and may even have negative consequences on an individual's health. Another concern with stacking is that using multiple products can result in an excessive amount of one ingredient while lacking in another, as the supplements may have overlapping components. This imbalance may not only reduce the effectiveness of the stack but also lead to health risks. In particular, overconsumption of specific substances can cause toxicity and other adverse effects, while inadequate levels of certain ingredients may result in deficiencies that hinder performance and progress. To avoid these potential pitfalls, bodybuilders should be cautious when designing their stack. First and foremost, they should extensively research the products they are considering, taking time to understand their individual properties, ideal dosages, and potential interactions with other ingredients. It is also vital to consult with medical and fitness professionals to determine which combination is most suitable for a specific individual, considering personal goals and health status. Moreover, maintaining a log of their stack regimen, including dosages and timings, can help bodybuilders recognize any problematic interactions or imbalances and make adjustments accordingly. In this way, they can optimize their stacking approach and achieve the best possible results while minimizing health risks. In summary, stacking is a popular practice among experienced bodybuilders who aim to maximize the synergy between various supplements and performance-enhancing substances. The key to success with stacking lies in choosing the right combination, appropriately balanced in terms of dosages and ingredients, to support personal fitness goals and health considerations. By conducting thorough research and monitoring their regimen, bodybuilders can take full advantage of this powerful strategy to reach their full physical potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Movie title: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Context: In 1818, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) lives in Indiana with his parents, Nancy (Robin McLeavy) and Thomas (Joseph Mawle), who works at a plantation owned by Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy. Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch. In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \\"Only the living can kill the dead\\"). Sturgess has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam. Disappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his...

Supporters Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks joined the party. The three men, who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple-slaying in West Memphis, walked free Friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering rarely used pleas in which they maintained their innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors have evidence to convict them. They had been imprisoned for the slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore. The boys' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces. Prosecutors argued that the defendants, teenagers at the time, were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols, sentenced to death, had been the ringleader.

Q:The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.

Cambridge, New Zealand is a small, picturesque town of just 18,400 inhabitants. The last time there was a royal visit here was a generation ago, in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip came just after the Queen's coronation. Locals still talk about that moment in local history, but now they have the next chapter. Excitement about this weekend's visit by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was on full display in the pretty high street. Every other shop had been decorated with bunting and royal paraphernalia. It was as if everyone had rummaged through their drawers looking for anything royal or just UK-related and turned it into a display. There was mannequin wearing a Union flag apron and a tea cozy on her head; tea caddies, tea cups, tea pots; umbrellas, ornamental London phone boxes and buses. There was even a tattered guidebook from Windsor Castle. Acoustic Mexican wave. The night before the visit, excitement reached fever pitch. People started camping outside the town hall. By dawn Saturday, the pavements were lined with well-wishers. People had come from as far away as New Zealand's capital, Wellington. By lunchtime, the population of the town had doubled. When we approached them with our camera, they cheered -- in fact if anything happened, they cheered. One teenager said she was a republican but had come here because of her mother who was a big royal fan. Both got in the spirit of things with matching tiara hair grips. There's always an eery calm before the royals actually turn up. The roads are cleared, security is locked down and then there is a pause before you hear -- then see -- police outriders. Suddenly, the royal limo is right there before you. Cue: scream. It's inverted \\"Bieber fever,\\" mums and daughters -- but with the mums shouting. In Cambridge, the royal convoy did a loop through the town and there was an acoustic Mexican wave as the cheers followed them. As the couple pulled up at the town hall and got out, the cheers erupted into screams ... then a huge boo, which was odd. Turns out a van had blocked the crowd's view but was quickly moved on, allowing the screams to resume. The Duchess hasn't been to New Zealand before and she wanted to meet as many people as possible, so \\"walkabouts\\" have been built into the schedule. Republican to royalist. At the Cambridge Town Hall, after meeting dignitaries and paying their respects at the war memorial, The Duke and Duchess crossed the road to the now heaving crowds. \\"I was here at half past two in the morning,\\" said one lady. \\"But this was an opportunity that I was not prepared to let go by any means of the imagination. I was going to be here come whatever.\\" After less than an hour, the royal visit was over. I spotted the royalist mother with her republican daughter. \\"How did you cope?\\" I asked. \\"I know you were quite excited beforehand.\\" \\"I was, I went all gooey,\\" she said. \\"Completely lost it but the good news is, I think I have converted my daughter to a royalist.\\" I put that to the daughter who said: \\"Yep. He shook my hand.\\" \\"That's all it takes?\\" I asked and she said; \\"Yep.\\" This royal tour must be sending shudders through the spine of the New Zealand republican movement. But we won't know what real impact it has had until the whirlwind is over, the window displays are back in the drawers and New Zealanders have had a proper chance to consider whether the Cambridges are people they like to see -- or would like to reign.

The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. The best known line-up of the group was its mid-70s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann. Several of the band's albums released during the 1990s were nominated for Grammy Awards. Since then, Tangerine Dream with Jerome Froese took a directional change away from the new-age leanings of those albums and toward an electronica style. After Jerome's departure, founder Edgar Froese steered the band in a direction somewhat reminiscent of material throughout their career. In later years, Tangerine Dream released albums in series. The Dream Mixes series began in 1995 with the last being released in 2010. The Divine Comedy series, based on the writings of Dante Alighieri, spanned 2002-2006. From 2007-2010, the Five Atomic Seasons were released. Most recently, the Eastgate Sonic Poems series, based on the works of famous poetic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, began in 2011, with the last appearing in 2013. Also, beginning in 2007, Tangerine Dream released a number of EPs, referred to as \\"CupDiscs\\" by the band. Edgar Froese also released a number of solo recordings which are similar in style to Tangerine Dream's work. Jerome Froese released a number of singles as TDJ Rome that are similar to his work within the Dream Mixes series. In 2005 he released his first solo album Neptunes under the name Jerome Froese. In 2006 Jerome left Tangerine Dream to concentrate on his solo career. His second solo album Shiver Me Timbers was released on 29 October 2007, and his third, Far Side of the Face, was released in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Jerome Froese joined with former Tangerine Dream member Johannes Schmoelling and keyboardist Robert Waters to form the band Loom, which plays original material as well as Tangerine Dream classics. Thorsten Quaeschning, leader of Picture Palace Music, was brought into Tangerine Dream in 2005, and contributed to most of the band's albums and CupDiscs since then. The group had recording contracts with Ohr, Virgin, Jive Electro, Private Music, and Miramar, and many of the minor soundtracks were released on Varese Sarabande. In 1996, the band founded their own record label, TDI, and more recently, Eastgate. Subsequent albums are today generally not available in normal retail channels but are sold by mail-order or through online channels. The same applies to their Miramar releases, the rights to which the band bought back. Meanwhile, their Ohr and Jive Electro catalogs (known as the \\"Pink\\" and \\"Blue\\" Years) are currently owned by Esoteric Recordings.

Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes. The astronaut is told to go to work on a flight into space. The crew members get to know each other first. Then they can learn which job each will do. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Options: A: After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. B: The crew members get to know each other after the tests. C: One of the first tests is for the heart. D: An astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness.

Question: After a major defeat, what does Brighton advise Faisal to do? Title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: The film is presented in two parts, divided by an intermission. Part I[edit] The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War, where Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest. Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasimâand Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear. Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares...

Q: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you. According to the above context, answer the following question. The narrator was thankful: Pick from: * during the time she treated her body badly. * not enough information. * after she treated her body badly. * before she treated her body badly.

Subsequently, the customer advises others to buy a new one of the product and expresses that he feels he wasted his money.

There is no statement in the review that indicates a positive experience or satisfaction with the product, which confirms that this is indeed a negative review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. If there were a maximum wage, would it lead to higher employment? Is implementing minimum wage a good/bad policy? Why? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Hello little buddy! Let me explain those questions to you. 1. If there were a maximum wage, would it lead to higher employment? Think about a maximum wage like a rule that says grown-ups can only earn a certain amount of money. If a company has to pay less to their big bosses, they may have extra money to hire more people, like how you get more candy when you spend less on a toy. But it's not always true - sometimes companies might not hire more people even if they have more money. So, having a maximum wage might lead to higher employment, but it's not guaranteed. 2. Is implementing a minimum wage a good/bad policy? Why? A minimum wage is like a rule that says grown-ups have to earn at least a certain amount of money for the work they do, like getting a prize for playing a game. If done right, it can be a good thing because it helps people have enough money to buy stuff they need, like clothes and food. But if the minimum wage is too high, companies might not be able to hire as many people, like when you can only invite a few friends to your birthday because of a budget. So, whether it's good or bad depends on how it's set up. Your questions are not the same, but they are related. The first one is about having a limit on how much money someone can earn (maximum wage) and whether it would help more people get jobs. The second question is about making sure grown-ups get paid at least a certain amount (minimum wage) and whether that's a good or bad thing. Both questions talk about rules for how much people can make at work and how these rules might affect jobs. I hope this helps you understand better!

Bizet the greatest honour\\"? , can you please find it? The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

Here is a question about this article: Apple did not develop the iPod software entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform based on two ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. iPods with color displays then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).

The Wallflowers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989 by singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee's house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica. By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne's studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album.Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band's previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002. While the Wallflowers were working on Red Letter Days, they recorded a cover of the Beatles' 1965 song \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" for the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002. The first single from the Red Letter Days, \\"When You're On Top,\\" was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, Red Letter Days was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the Billboard 200. Around the time of Red Letter Days' release the Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, the Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, the Wallflowers' drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band. In 2003, the Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film American Wedding. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison's 1970 song \\"Into the Mystic\\". The film's music department weren't able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison's version so they enlisted the Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film. Entity:","completion":"The Wallflowers"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Expect viburnum snowball bushes to blossom in May. Heavy pruning should only be done at this time since you can easily destroy next year’s flowers by removing old wood. Deadheading, or cutting off the flowers, won’t harm viburnum. However, doing it isn’t necessary and prevents the plant from growing berries. The oldest branches are the thickest, woodiest ones. They may produce side shoots or have flaky bark that make them easier to recognize. Using a clean, sharp pair of shears, cut as close to the soil as you can to completely remove the shoots. At most, remove no more than ⅓ of the shoots. Usually, this means removing 1 to 3 shoots at a time. Leave behind the thinner, fresher shoots coming up from the plant’s base. These will rejuvenate your viburnum. Although the snowball flowers bloom on old wood in viburnum plants, the oldest shoots produce weak flowers and are safe to remove. Viburnum often grows well when it is left alone, so you may not need to do routine trimming. If your bush gets too large or begins extending out of its spot in your yard, use clippers to reduce its size. Cut the branches as needed. Remember to only perform hard trimming in spring, after the bloom, to avoid damaging the bush’s buds the next year. You can trim the branches this way to maintain the snowball bush’s rounded shape or sculpt it into a hedge. Viburnum snowball bushes grow relatively quickly, so they can become too tall or crowded. If your bush needs serious work, use shears to trim the shoots and branches back. You can also cut out the larger, older shoots to thin the plant. The best time to do this is around May, after the flowers bloom, although it can be done anytime as needed. After trimming back the plant, you may want to wait and watch it grow back. Then you can see where you need to thin out the branches. By maintaining the bush regularly, you likely won’t need to do this. Examine your snowball bush throughout the year to look for broken or rotting branches. With a sharp pair of shears, cut out the damaged parts. If possible, cut above the nodes, which are where new leaves and branches grow off of the old branches. This routine trimming should be done year-round to keep your snowball bush healthy and thriving. Summary:","completion":"So kiddo, a viburnum snowball bush is a really cool type of plant that blooms beautiful flowers in May. Just imagine a snowball fight in the summertime! Now, these plants are very particular about when and how you cut them. Just like how you wouldn't want to cut your hair too short, we don't want to cut too much off of these plants either. We only prune, or cut, a lot off the bush after the flowers bloom in the springtime, and we should only cut about a third of the old, thick branches that come from the bottom of the plant. They're like the grandpas of the plant - old but very important. Now, except for spring, most of the time the plant likes being left alone, just like you when you're playing with your toys, right? But sometimes they grow too big and we need to trim them a little bit, kind of like how your hair needs a trim when it grows too long. And kiddo, it's very important to look out for any branches that look sick or broken, and they need to be cut off so the whole plant can stay healthy. It's like when you get a boo-boo and we clean it up to keep you healthy! So, all in all, taking care of a viburnum snowball bush is a bit of work, but seeing its beautiful snowball-like flowers makes it all worth it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Take note of heavy eye contact. See how close they get to you. Look at their hand gestures. Pay attention to awkward behavior. See if they mirror your behavior.","completion":"Title: Interpreting Nonverbal Communication: Spot the Signs to Unravel the Message Introduction In the realm of human communication, words are just a part of the story. Nonverbal cues, including eye contact, body language, and facial expressions, often reveal more about a person's thoughts and feelings than their spoken words. Recognizing and accurately interpreting these subtle signs can help you understand someone's intentions, build rapport, and even avoid misunderstandings in various settings. In this article, we'll delve into five important nonverbal cues that you should be aware of in order to enhance your communication skills. 1. Heavy Eye Contact One of the most important aspects of nonverbal communication is eye contact, as it can reveal sincerity, confidence, or an attempt to establish connection. If someone maintains heavy eye contact with you, it can imply that they are genuinely interested in what you are saying or trying to assert dominance and establish a position of power. Alternatively, averted or minimal eye contact might suggest discomfort, dishonesty, or disinterest. 2. Physical Distance Pay attention to how close someone gets to you as an indication of their comfort level and emotional state. People who feel at ease and connected with you are more likely to position themselves closer to you, whereas those who feel discomfort or disinterest may keep their distance. It's essential to respect cultural differences and personal boundaries while evaluating the proximity factor in nonverbal communication. 3. Hand Gestures Hand gestures can add nuance and depth to a spoken message or even convey entire ideas without the use of words. For instance, open gestures usually signal a friendly and approachable attitude, while closed gestures, such as crossing arms, might signify defensiveness or resistance. Similarly, pointing fingers or aggressive hand movements can indicate an assertive or dominating disposition. Observing an individual's hand gestures can provide valuable insights into their emotional state and thought process. 4. Awkward Behavior Nervousness, doubt, or anxiety can manifest in a range of awkward behaviors such as fidgeting, shifting postures, touching the face, or rapid blinking. If someone exhibits these or similar actions, they might be struggling with their emotions or trying to conceal their true thoughts. Offering a reassuring and empathetic response can alleviate tension and create a more comfortable environment for genuine communication. 5. Mirroring The subtle act of mirroring is when one person unconsciously mimics the behavior, expressions, or posture of another. In psychological terms, this phenomenon can indicate rapport, trust, and likability between the individuals involved. Noticing when someone mirrors your actions can help you assess the strength of your connection and adjust your communication style accordingly. Conclusion Being attentive to nonverbal cues is crucial in fostering effective communication. By identifying and understanding these subtle signs, you can gain a deeper comprehension of others' thoughts, feelings, and intentions. In turn, developing this skill will enhance your ability to navigate social situations, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Before the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914,the only way ships could leave Boston was on a route around Race Point--the northern tip of Cape Cod.However,navigation during the 18th century was a nightmare,because the floating cross current around Race Point caused countless accidents.So building a lighthouse to lighten the place was very necessary. As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid 8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.

There used to be an 18th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at the crossing with Park Avenue South.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks why subways can't be used to travel to another state with the given context about a specific station in a city. Step 2: Use provided context 18th street's station is provided as an example in the context, along with details about the lines and crossings. From the context, we can gather that this station is likely situated within a city rather than between states. Step 3: Analyze the purpose of the subway system Subway systems are typically designed to provide transportation within a city or metropolitan area. They handle high volumes of commuter traffic within a relatively compact geographical area. Inter-state travel, on the other hand, typically covers larger distances and might require different modes of transportation, like rail, buses, or air. Step 4: Identify the reason for the limitation Subway systems are not built to span the vast distances between states in order to keep construction and maintenance costs reasonable. Additionally, given the high costs and infrastructure complexities, there's simply no practical need for subways to stretch to other states when other transportation modes are more efficient. Step 5: Formulate a coherent answer Subway systems, such as the one in the context with the 18th Street station, are not designed to take you to another state primarily because they serve to transport people within a city or metropolitan area. The infrastructure and construction costs of creating a subway system that spans across states would be significant and impractical compared to the more efficient modes of transportation already in place for such distances, like rail, buses, or air travel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the original statement does not explicitly mention that this event is taking place \\"outside,\\" it can be reasonably inferred, as inline skating typically occurs in outdoor settings, such as sidewalks, parks, or streets. So, based on these similarities between the two statements, we can conclude that they have the same core meaning.

Why is Ben Jealous stepping down from the NAACP?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They are instead related to two different aspects of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The first question, \\"What are some activities of the NAACP?\\", is seeking information about the types of activities and actions that the NAACP takes or organizes. The NAACP is a civil rights organization that was established to fight for the rights of African Americans and people of color in the United States. These activities could pertain to a range of areas including legal, social, educational, economic or political. The NAACP undertakes various activities such as public demonstrations, advocacy work, educational programs, and legal aid services, among others. Their initiatives could also include lobbying for policies or laws that protect the rights and promote the welfare of people of color. This question is therefore asking for a description or examples of these sorts of activities. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Why is Ben Jealous stepping down from the NAACP?\\", is a very specific query about a particular individual related to the NAACP. Ben Jealous is a former president and chief executive of the NAACP who served from 2008 to 2013. This question is asking about the reasons that led to his departure from the organization. It requests information that pertains directly to Jealous’s decisions, motivations, or circumstances that led to his stepping down, and may thus require knowledge or research into events, statements or sources from that particular time period. Jealous announced his plans to step down in 2013, citing personal reasons related to spending more time with his young family. However, his departure could also be contextualized within his career trajectory, his accomplishments during his tenure, or developments within the NAACP or wider civil rights movement at that time. So, while both questions are related to the NAACP, they ask for different kinds of information - one a general overview of the association's undertakings, and the other a precise inquiry about an event involving a notable figure within the NAACP. It implies that the person asking the questions has the knowledge of Ben Jealous's affiliation with the NAACP, while the first question can be asked by someone with basic or no knowledge of the NAACP's operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath.

Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation. - The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, referred to ceremonially as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader.

According to reports, a PE teacher stands accused of taking advantage of a drunken woman and raping her, as stated by the prosecution at the trial. The case has drawn significant public attention, and the stakes are high for both the accused and the victim. This article will delve into the details of this incident to examine the broader implications of sexual assault among educators and the measures that need to be taken to protect vulnerable individuals. The Case Unfolds In the United Kingdom, a jury heard the case of a male physical education (PE) teacher who was accused of raping a woman under the influence of alcohol. The prosecution claims that the defendant took advantage of the woman's inebriated state during their encounter and proceeded to sexually assault her. The accused has denied the allegations, suggesting he had consensual sex with the woman. The incident raises questions about the responsibilities and conduct of educators – especially those who serve as role models for young people. While the case is still ongoing, the public debate around it highlights the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to such incidents. Sexual Assault in Educational Settings: A Larger Issue Unfortunately, sexual assault within educational settings is more common than we would like to admit. Teachers, who often spend more time with students than their own families, are generally expected to uphold a high standard of ethical and professional conduct. However, there are known cases of teachers abusing their positions of authority to engage in inappropriate relationships or, as in this case, act on sinister intentions towards vulnerable individuals. In a society where trust and safety are paramount, such incidents involving educators can engender fear and anxiety amongst the general public. These emotions, in turn, can have serious consequences for schools, parents, and most importantly, the young people who look up to these authority figures. Preventive Measures in Schools and Communities The current case involving the PE teacher demonstrates the need for schools and communities to adopt more stringent measures when it comes to hiring and monitoring the conduct of their educators. Thorough background checks and continuous monitoring of teachers' behavior can help identify potential signs of misconduct or abuse. Similarly, schools should regularly educate students on the importance of consent and promote an atmosphere where victims feel comfortable speaking out and seeking help if they believe they have been victimized. Open communication channels allow for prompt reporting of any concerns or incidents while maintaining the privacy and safety of all parties involved. Beyond Institutional Responsibilities While schools bear a significant responsibility in ensuring the safety and welfare of their students, the issue of sexual assault extends beyond the confines of educational institutions. Communities, families, and individuals must be vigilant about recognizing warning signs and providing support for those who have experienced sexual assault. On a broader level, society needs to engage in candid conversations about consent, boundaries, and the many forms that abuse can take. Promoting awareness, education, and open dialogue can help break down the stigma attached to discussing these sensitive topics and foster an environment where everyone feels empowered to step forward and seek help. Conclusion The ongoing case involving the PE teacher accused of rape serves as a stark reminder of the importance of discussing sexual assault within the context of educational settings. As the trial unfolds, it is crucial for society to use these types of cases as learning opportunities, emphasizing the need for schools, communities, and individuals to work together to create a safer and more inclusive environment. Taking necessary steps to prevent and address sexual assault is not just a moral imperative, but also a vital component in ensuring the well-being of our communities and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television. The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \\"flex scheduling\\" policy. The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \\"finesse team\\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5. The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \\"LH\\" decals on the backs of their helmets. The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball. The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson. The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight). Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime. The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception. It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one. Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out. The game was the Chiefs' third straight loss as they fell to 7-7 and the Chargers' eighth straight win as they improved to 12-2. Answer this question based on the article: How many of Green's passes were incomplete?","completion":"Based on the article, Trent Green completed 23 of his 41 passes.

A remixed version appeared on their album \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\". - De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987 on Long Island, New York. The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \\"Plug Tunin'\\". With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\", has been called \\"a hip hop masterpiece.\\" - \`\` Stakes Is High '' is a single by De La Soul released in 1996 from their album Stakes Is High . - Stakes Is High is De La Soul's fourth full-length album, released on July 2, 1996. The album marked a change in the group's sound and direction as it was their first release not to be produced in collaboration with Prince Paul. \\"Stakes Is High\\" was mainly produced by the group themselves with additional tracks provided by Jay Dee, DJ Ogee, Spearhead X and Skeff Anslem. It received mostly strong reviews but little commercial success. - 3 Feet High and Rising is the debut studio album by American hip hop trio De La Soul. It was released on March 14, 1989, by Tommy Boy Records and Warner Bros. Records. It marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It is consistently placed on 'greatest albums' lists by noted music critics and publications. Robert Christgau called the record \\"unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard.\\" In 1998, the album was selected as one of \\"The Source Magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums.\\" - Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands. - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\" After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'stakes is high ' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - 1996 - album - funk - island - pop - record - studio album - tommy boy records Answer:","completion":"After carefully examining the information provided, the correct answer is: - Tommy Boy Records This is because the paragraph about \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\" states that it was released on March 14, 1989, by Tommy Boy Records and Warner Bros. Records. Since \\"Stakes Is High\\" is a single from De La Soul's album with the same name, it can be inferred that the record label associated with 'stakes is high' is Tommy Boy Records."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Following the Taliban prisoner swap that led to the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News that 30% of the detainees released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay \\"have already gone back into the fight.\\" It's a figure that has been frequently repeated in recent days, but is it true? It depends on who is doing the counting. According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which regularly releases an unclassified summary report about former detainees, as of January this year, 104 of the 614 detainees (17%) released from the prison have engaged in \\"terrorist activities,\\" while another 74 (12%) are suspected of doing so. It is impossible to assess the validity of the U.S. government's claim, referenced by McCain, that nearly 30% of the released detainees are confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorist activity because the government has not publicly released the names of any of these detainees for the past five years. The U.S. government defines a \\"confirmed\\" terrorist or insurgent as based on a \\"preponderance\\" of information pointing to that conclusion, while someone in the \\"suspected\\" category is based on plausible but unverified or single source reporting to that effect. In order to shed some light on exactly which graduates from Guantanamo have joined a militant group or engaged in some other kind of terrorist activity, the New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports, news stories, and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have \\"returned to the battlefield.\\" The list can be found here. The New America list documents a much smaller number than does the U.S. government. Of the 620 former detainees who have been transferred from the prison camp, we have identified 15 former Guantanamo detainees (2.5%) who are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while there are 21 individuals (3.5%) who are suspected of engaging in such activities. We also identified 18 former detainees (3%) who are confirmed or suspected of involvement in militant attacks against non-U.S. targets. Taking all three categories together, the New America list finds only a third as many Guantanamo prisoners have returned to the battlefield, compared to the U.S. government estimate. A recent example of this is British citizen Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo prisoner released in 2005, who was arrested in December on terrorism charges related to the Syrian civil war. He has denied the charges. It's important to note that the vast majority of individuals who are confirmed or suspected to have militant groups were released under the George W. Bush administration, a fact that is missing from much of the current commentary. For the purposes of our study, for a former detainee to be considered \\"confirmed\\" that he had joined a militant group, there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For those \\"suspected\\" of such acts, there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities. While it is certainly possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly, we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks, as it is a propaganda coup for them, and the media is also quick to highlight such stories. Based on our findings, even if you combine all of the released detainees who are confirmed or suspected of taking part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world, the total comes to 54, or 8.7%, which is much lower than the 30% being cited by the U.S. intelligence community and members of Congress. This percentage is also much lower than the recidivism rate of criminals within the United States, which currently stands around 67.5%, according to the most recent statistics by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some of the Guantanamo prisoners who were released by the Bush administration are certainly quite dangerous. Said Ali al-Shiri, who co-founded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009, was transferred to Saudi Arabia in 2007. Shiri completed the kingdom's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to Yemen, where he became AQAP's deputy commander. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year. Another example is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul (who also goes by the name Mullah Zakir), who has emerged as one of the top Taliban commanders. Rasoul was also transferred from Guantanamo to Afghanistan in 2007 by the Bush administration and rejoined the Taliban shortly after the Afghan government released him from custody. Under Obama, the U.S. State Department and U.S. Defense Department use comprehensive threat assessments to determine a detainee's eligibility for release. This has contributed to the fact that of the 88 prisoners released under Obama, we were only able to find publicly available information about one of those who had joined a militant group: Abdul Hafiz, who was returned to Afghanistan and is accused of fighting for the Taliban and targeting Afghan aid workers. (The intelligence community claims five Obama-era releasees have joined militant groups.) Of course the high-ranking Taliban prisoners released in the exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl are not just low-level militants and President Obama himself has admitted that they might pose some future threat. \\"Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place,\\" Obama said. But these men are not being released freely into Afghan society. They have been transferred to the custody of Qatar, which is a rich, efficient police state and they have been banned from travel for a year. Assuming that ban holds, by the time they are able to travel back to Afghanistan, there will no longer be any U.S. combat presence as American combat soldiers are all pulling out at the end of December 2014. So any potential threat that those five Taliban officials might pose to American targets in Afghanistan will be much smaller by then. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1. There are differing reports about the number of detainees released from Guantanamo Bay who have returned to terrorist activities. U.S. government figures suggested around 30% have or are suspected to have, but the New America Foundation found it to be only 8.7%. 2. Most of the detainees suspected or confirmed to have joined militant groups were released under the George W. Bush administration. 3. High-profile cases include Said Ali al-Shiri who co-founded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul who became a top Taliban commander. 4. Under the Obama administration, comprehensive threat assessments have been used to determine a detainee's eligibility for release. As a result, there is only one publicly known case of a released detainee joining a militant group. 5. Recently, high-ranking Taliban prisoners were released in an exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl, which has sparked debate. However, they're not free but were transferred to Qatar with a travel ban for a year. By the time they could potentially return to Afghanistan, the U.S. combat presence there will be significantly reduced."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"1). No. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other as they are addressing different aspects related to democracy. I will answer both questions separately to provide a detailed understanding. Disadvantages of Democracy: While democracy is considered an ideal form of government where power is vested in the hands of the people, it does have its drawbacks. Here are some of the disadvantages of democracy: 1. Slow decision-making: In a democratic system, multiple factions have to debate and agree upon any policy or decision. This can result in delayed decision-making and slow progress on issues. 2. Populism and short-termism: Since leaders are elected through popular votes, politicians may cater to the short-term interests of the public instead of considering long-term consequences and making unpopular but necessary decisions for the nation's well-being. 3. Voter influence and misinformation: The public can be influenced by false or misleading arguments made by politicians and media. As a result, voters might make decisions based on misinformation, emotional appeals, and biased perspectives. 4. Tyranny of the majority: Majority rule can lead to the suppression of minority rights and interests. This can result in unfair treatment or infringements on the rights of minority groups. 5. Corruption and cronyism: The competition for votes and resources can sometimes lead to corruption, bribery, and nepotism among politicians, diverting resources away from important state issues and allowing well-connected individuals to reap benefits at the expense of others. India: A Democracy or a Republic? India is a democratic republic, which means it is a combination of both democracy and republic. The citizens of India have the right to choose their leaders through free and fair elections, making it a democratic country. Additionally, India is a republic because it has a president as its head of state, elected by an electoral college representing the people, rather than a hereditary monarch. In conclusion, the two questions address different aspects of democracy. The first question details the disadvantages of democracy, while the second delves into the classification of India as a democratic republic. Therefore, the answer to the given options is 1). No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen.

Article:Michael Dynes, 39, targeted young people through online advertisements for life models. The court heard he \\"auditioned\\" young people via webcam. Posing as a \\"casting agent\\", he would incite them to commit sexual acts. Dynes, who is originally from Dungannon, County Tyrone, but now lives in a hostel in Ballymena, County Antrim, pleaded guilty to 41 sex charges, including making and possessing indecent images of children. He also admitted inciting children, some of whom were younger than 13 years old, to engage in a sexual act as well as four charges of voyeurism. The judge at Dungannon Crown Court said the public would be better protected by extending the supervised licence period to allow Dynes to undergo a full course of treatment, instead of returning him to prison for a month or two. The court was told that Dynes has lost his job, marriage and his home as a result of his offending. \\"All of that is now gone, solely due to your own criminal behaviour,\\" the judge told him. \\"The offences effectively ruined your life. That is entirely your own fault.\\" He added that the images Dynes owned and created were of \\"real-life children... who have been sexually abused so that people like you can view them\\". \\"No one should be in any doubt, that market would not exist but for people like you.\\" Dynes was caught on his own recording equipment while installing it in a bedroom, which then filmed a female carrying out private acts. A camera was also installed by Dynes in a workplace kitchen, which resulted in \\"up-skirt\\" filming. The defendant had spent 14 months remanded in custody in prison, which the judge said was the equivalent of a 28-month sentence. The judge imposed a sentence of three years and one month on all counts, and set the period of custody at 13 months followed by 24 months supervision. He said this was the minimum necessary for Dynes to complete the tailored sex offenders order that he needed. He said the sentence would punish him for his criminal behaviour, serve as a deterrent to others and lead to his not committing any further offences. The judge also said any breach of the heavily-monitored supervision would see him returned to prison for the full period of the sentence. The judge added that as the internet continued to impact upon the modern world, \\"the law will continue to develop in this area\\". Dynes was put on the sex offenders' register for life and will be subjected to terms of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) that will monitor him for the next 10 years. He was arrested as part of Operation Jarra, a joint operation between the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). His home was searched in June 2015 and a forensic examination of his computers revealed 1,133 indecent images. An NCA officer told an earlier court hearing that the investigation had revealed Dynes was chatting with boys and girls online and trying to incite them into committing sexual acts. The officer described the matter as \\"one of the most serious cases of sexual exploitation of children encountered by the agency\\".

Answer the question: Will weighed himself on a scale. He weighs less than last year. His force of gravitational attraction increased or decreased? A:","completion":"Given the information that Will weighs less than last year, it can be concluded that his force of gravitational attraction has decreased. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand the concept of gravitational attraction and its relationship with mass. Gravitational attraction is the force that exists between two masses that have a certain distance between them. In simpler terms, it is the force that pulls objects with mass towards each other. This force is governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The formula for calculating gravitational force (F) is: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 where - G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), - m1 and m2 are the masses of two objects experiencing the force of attraction, - r is the distance between the centers of mass of the two objects. When we talk about a person's weight, it is actually the force of gravitational attraction between the person (their mass) and Earth (its mass). In this case, m1 represents the person's mass, m2 represents Earth's mass, and r is the distance between the person and the center of Earth. Since the Earth's mass (m2) remains constant and the distance from Earth's center (r) is roughly the same for humans living on the surface, the weight of the person (F) is directly related to their mass (m1). As Will now weighs less than last year, his mass (m1) has decreased. Since the other factors in the equation—Earth's mass and the distance from its center—remain constant, the change in Will's mass directly results in a change in the force of gravitational attraction. If his mass has decreased, the force of gravitational attraction (i.e., his weight) has also decreased, following the relationship established by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Furthermore, it informs us that the study is shedding light on the vulnerability of boys. This shift in focus is what the hypothesis is based on. The hypothesis states that the scholar who used to study girls has turned her attention to boys, which is a conclusion drawn from the information given in the premise. The premise makes it clear that the attention of the scholar has now shifted from young girls to young boys. Therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise. However, it is necessary to take into account the context of this shift in focus. The premise highlights that the scholar is discovering how vulnerable boys are, which may imply that she is now focusing on understanding and exploring the issues faced by young boys, in order to provide better insight and understanding of the challenges faced by both genders. This exploration allows for a more comprehensive and informed discussion on the issues affecting young people in general. In conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it restates and summarizes the main point conveyed in the premise: that the feminist scholar, previously known for studying young girls, is now studying young boys, and consequently discovering their vulnerability. This defines a logical and clear connection between the premise presented and the hypothesis derived."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Proper nouns retain their original form and pronunciations when used in different languages as they represent unique individuals, places, organizations, and so on. Charles de Gaulle was a very prominent French figure: a statesman and military leader who led Free France against Nazi Germany in World War II. He was also the 18th President of France from 1959 to 1969. His name is quite often directly used in Czech texts when referencing him, keeping the spelling and pronunciation intact to avoid any confusion. It is worth mentioning that the pronunciation might be slightly adjusted based on the phonetic sounds of Czech language, but it would still strive to retain the essence of the original French pronunciation. In biographical details, you might also find his name mentioned as \\"Charles de Gaulle,\\" as it is, but with details added in Czech to give context. For example: \\"Charles de Gaulle was a francouzský státník a vojenský vůdce...\\" which translates to \\"Charles de Gaulle was a French statesman and military leader...\\" Remember that translating goes beyond just changing words from one language to another—it’s about accurately conveying meaning and respecting cultural nuances, including the handling of proper names."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The North Avenue Irregulars Context: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Five women from his congregation (and Delany, whose wife does not drive) attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness.

One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., what would be the answer ?

The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Augustus \`\` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio . - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966.

Rochak A:","completion":"Title: \\"Mama's Big Mistake\\" Step 1: Define the main characters Mama: A kind-hearted, well-intentioned but slightly clumsy woman who ends up making a big mistake while trying to protect her family. Rochak: A charming and resourceful young man who is mistakenly kidnapped by Mama but eventually becomes an integral part of her life. Lisa: Mama's loving and responsible daughter who helps Mama correct her mistake. Step 2: Establish the setting The movie takes place in a quaint and colorful small town, where everyone knows one another and secrets are hard to keep. Step 3: Build a backstory for the characters Mama's husband had recently passed away, and she's been struggling to cope with the loss while taking care of her daughter, Lisa. She hears about a dangerous person in town who might pose a threat to her family and decides to take matters into her own hands. Rochak is a young man who recently moved to the town and is trying to find his footing in this new community. He's misunderstood by the locals, which eventually leads to Mama's confusion and mistaken kidnap. Lisa is Mama's teenage daughter, who is mature beyond her years due to her father's passing. She's popular in school and is always working to help her mother navigate through her struggles. Step 4: Create the main plot Mama hears about a dangerous person in town and mistakenly believes Rochak to be the threat. In her well-meaning but misguided attempt to protect her family, she kidnaps Rochak and brings him home. Mama soon realizes her mistake and tries to make amends, but by the time she does, the news of the kidnapping has spread through the town, putting Mama's reputation and her relationship with Lisa at risk. Step 5: Develop character arcs As Mama gets to know Rochak, she learns that he is far from the dangerous person she thought he was, and both Mama and Rochak begin to form a genuine friendship. In fact, Rochak helps Mama in dealing with her grief and eventually becomes a positive influence on both Mama and Lisa. Meanwhile, Lisa feels embarrassed by her mother's actions but learns to empathize with Mama's intentions. As a result, Lisa comes to understand her mother's behavior better and the two grow closer. Step 6: Introduce a subplot As the story unfolds, Rochak's own past is gradually revealed, as well as the reason he moved to the small town. With the help of Mama and Lisa, Rochak overcomes his own obstacles and begins to settle into his new life. Step 7: Resolve the main plot Mama, Lisa, and Rochak work together to clear Mama's name and correct the misunderstanding with the townspeople. The community comes to understand them better and learns to embrace Rochak as one of their own. Mama, Lisa, and Rochak end up forming a new and unusual family unit, united by love and understanding. Step 8: Conclude the story \\"Mama's Big Mistake\\" concludes with a heartwarming scene where Mama, Lisa, and Rochak celebrate their new bond and the small town's newfound acceptance. As the camera pans out, we see the quirky town continuing to grow and change, reflecting the idea that even the most unusual circumstances can lead to wonderful and unexpected connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1978, it published the first graphic novel intended for the newly created comic book specialty store market. It was one of the first to offer royalties and creator ownership of rights, and the first comics company to publish trading cards. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content.

If \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror.\\", does this mean that \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\"? -- yes; -- it is not possible to tell; -- no;","completion":"The phrase \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror\\" does not necessarily mean \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\" There are a few important distinctions to consider. Firstly, the initial phrase specifies that the male individual is shirtless, which means he is not wearing a shirt. The second phrase, however, identifies that the male is in a shirt, suggesting he is wearing one. Therefore, there is a direct contradiction in the clothing status of the male individual in the two descriptions. Secondly, the first phrase generally says the male is shaving but doesn't specify what he is shaving. He could be shaving his face, chest, or even head. The second phrase, however, is more specific, stating that the male is shaving his mustache. This introduces a level of detail not present in the first phrase, which makes a significant difference in interpreting the two sentences. Since the context, specifics, and wording of both phrases are different, it's reasonable to conclude that \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror\\" doesn't necessarily equate to \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\" While there is a common element - a male individual shaving in front of a mirror - the specifics regarding the state of clothing and the area being shaved differ markedly.

Colonial records of French and Spanish slave ships and sales, and plantation records in all the former colonies, often have much more information about slaves, from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories. Genealogists have begun to find plantation records, court records, land deeds and other sources to trace African-American families and individuals before 1870. As slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write, black families passed along oral histories, which have had great persistence. Similarly, Native Americans did not generally learn to read and write English, although some did in the nineteenth century. Until 1930, census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race. When those terms were dropped, as a result of the lobbying by the Southern Congressional bloc, the Census Bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white, as was typical in segregated southern states. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do genealogists use to trace African American families after 1870?","completion":"After 1870, genealogists use a variety of resources to trace African American families. Some of the most important sources include: 1. Census records: Starting from the 1870 U.S. Federal Census, formerly enslaved African Americans were enumerated as individuals, providing valuable information about families, occupations, and residences. Census records from 1870 onwardserve as a primary source for genealogists to trace African American family lineages and connect ancestors to specific locations. 2. Vital records: Birth, marriage, and death records often contain important information for genealogists. These records became more widely available and standardized after the Civil War, providing crucial data for tracing African American families. 3. Freedmen's Bureau records: Established in 1865, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, colloquially known as the Freedmen's Bureau, generated a vast collection of records pertaining to newly freed African Americans. These documents include labor contracts, educational efforts, medical assistance, and many other aspects of life during Reconstruction. The records can be useful for genealogists to trace individual and family histories. 4. Military records: African American men who served in the United States Colored Troops (USCT) during the Civil War have service records, pension files, and other military-related documents that can be used to trace family histories. Additionally, military records from subsequent conflicts, such as World War I and World War II, can also provide genealogists with important information. 5. Land records: Property deeds and related land documents can provide extensive information about landownership and family relationships, helping genealogists reconstruct African American family histories. 6. Local and state archives: Court records, wills, probate documents, voter registration lists, city directories, and other materials held in local and state archives can be invaluable resources for genealogists researching African American families. 7. Church records: African American churches have often played a central role in family and community life, and many have maintained records of baptisms, marriages, and funerals, which can be valuable resources for genealogists tracing family histories. 8. Newspapers and periodicals: Articles, obituaries, and classified advertisements in African American newspapers and periodicals can provide useful information for genealogists to trace families and individuals. 9. Oral histories: Many African American families preserved their stories and traditions through oral history. While not always documented through official records, these narratives can be invaluable in filling gaps and providing context for genealogical research. 10. Slave narratives and biographies: Personal accounts written by or about formerly enslaved people provide a wealth of information about individual lives and experiences. These accounts can be an essential resource for genealogists tracing African American families during and after slavery. By utilizing these sources, genealogists can effectively trace African American families and individuals after 1870, reconstructing family histories and uncovering important connections to their ancestors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Inside the lab, they discover a strange device that accidentally shrinks them down to the size of insects. As they embark on an incredible journey to return to their normal size, Bob and Sally must navigate through a world filled with wonder and danger that they've never seen before. Act 1: Bob and Sally, two nature enthusiasts, are on a camping trip to explore the beauty of the ancient forest. They come across an uncharted path that leads them to a hidden laboratory, overgrown with vegetation, and covered in dust and cobwebs. Intrigued by their discovery, they cautiously step inside and accidentally activate a mysterious shrinking device. Within moments, they find themselves reduced to the size of insects, and the machine appears to be damaged and malfunctioning, rendering it useless. Act 2: As the reality of their situation sets in, Bob and Sally realize that they must find a way to reverse the shrinking process and return to their normal size. They set out on a journey through the now-gigantic forest, encountering various animals they once knew well but now seem like monstrous threats. Along the way, they meet new friends in the form of other bugs who help them navigate through their new world and teach them valuable life lessons. Their journey is filled with numerous obstacles and challenges, like crossing a raging river avoided by predators and enduring torrential rainstorms. Through teamwork and determination, Bob and Sally persist, always keeping their eyes on the ultimate goal: returning to their normal size. Act 3: As Bob and Sally make their way through the forest, they come across a scientist named Dr. Iris, who has been searching for the hidden laboratory for years. The lab once belonged to her grandfather, a genius scientist who passed away before he could reverse the effects of the shrinking device. Together, the trio returns to the laboratory with the new knowledge gathered during Bob and Sally's incredible journey. They manage to repair the shrinking device and carefully use it to return themselves to their regular size. Relieved but forever changed by their experience, Bob and Sally share a heartfelt farewell with their newfound insect friends before rejoining the human world. In the end, Bob and Sally's incredible shrinking adventure becomes a story of self-discovery, where they learn their strength, resilience, and the importance of looking at the world from a new perspective.

Answer based on context: The Vikings traveled to Green Bay in week 12 to face a Packers team missing quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had suffered a fractured left collarbone three weeks earlier. After successive punts from each side started the game, the Packers were the first to score as backup QB Scott Tolzien ran in for a 6-yard touchdown, but two field goals from Blair Walsh and a 1-yard touchdown run for Adrian Peterson meant the Vikings took a 13-7 lead into halftime. They extended their lead midway through the third quarter as Christian Ponder hit tight end Rhett Ellison for a 12-yard touchdown, and Walsh made it a 16-point lead with a 29-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter. The Packers pulled the struggling Tolzien after the Ellison touchdown and replaced him with the recently re-signed Matt Flynn. Flynn then led the Packers on three consecutive scoring drives in the fourth quarter, starting with a 3-yard touchdown run for Eddie Lacy. Flynn's pass to Andrew Quarless on the two-point attempt fell incomplete, but Flynn was able to find Jarrett Boykin for a 6-yard touchdown on the next drive to reduce the Vikings' lead to three points. Inside the two-minute warning, Flynn combined with James Jones for a 28-yard completion on 4th-and-6, setting up Mason Crosby for the game-tying, 27-yard field goal. The Packers won the overtime coin toss and took the opening possession down to the Minnesota 2-yard line before having to settle for a field goal, only for Walsh to respond with a 35-yard effort. The two sides then exchanged possession as neither was able to put together a significant drive and the game ended in a 26-26 tie.

The nation's largest group of pediatricians on Monday urged its members to \\"firmly oppose boxing for any child or adolescent.\\" In a statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said thousands of boys and girls take part in the sport in North America, despite risks of serious brain and facial injuries. The group's position was approved by some experts. \\"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries. \\" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\\" He said. According to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade. Pat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students. \\" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\\" Russo said. \\"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\\" Dr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids. \\" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\\" he said. \\"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\\" said Cantu. \\" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live.

Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. \\"It was not such an easy task\\" - \\"Se ei ollutkaan niin helppo tehtävä\\" - 'It was not' translates to 'Se ei ollut', added 'kaan' to emphasize the surprise (not after all), - 'such an easy' to 'niin helppo', and - 'task' to 'tehtävä'. 2. \\"and I am grateful\\" - \\"ja olen kiitollinen\\" - 'and' translates to 'ja', - 'I am' to 'olen', and - 'grateful' to 'kiitollinen'. 3. \\"that we managed to cooperate\\" - \\"että onnistuimme yhteistyössä\\" - 'that' translates to 'että', - 'we managed' to 'onnistuimme' (the 'we' is implied in the verb conjugation), - 'to cooperate' to 'yhteistyössä' (in cooperation). 4. \\"in an objective manner\\" - \\"objektiivisella tavalla\\" - 'in an' translates to 'lla' suffix, - 'objective' to 'objektiivinen', and - 'manner' to 'tavalla'. 5. \\"and to seek out\\" - \\"ja pyrkimään löytämään\\" - 'and' translates again to 'ja', - 'to seek' to 'pyrkimään', and - 'out' is added emphasis, so 'löytämään' is used (to find). 6. \\"the widest possible common ground\\" - \\"mahdollisimman laajan yhteisen pohjan\\" - 'the widest possible' translates to 'mahdollisimman laaja', - 'common' to 'yhteisen', and - 'ground' to 'pohjan' (used as a base, foundation). 7. \\"on what is not an entirely straightforward issue\\" - \\"sellaisessa asiassa, joka ei ole täysin yksinkertainen\\" - 'on' translates to 'ssa' suffix ('in'), - 'what is not' to 'joka ei ole', - 'an entirely' to 'täysin', and - 'straightforward issue' to 'yksinkertainen asia'.

The Met Office has issued a \\"be aware\\" warning as more heavy rain is expected across Wales on Saturday morning. In Cardigan, St Mary Street was reported to be knee-deep in flood water in places. The Angel Hotel which was hit for the second time this year. Heavy rain sent surface water pouring through the hotel's ground floor from front to back. The hotel had only recently been repaired after flooding at the start of this year. Fire crews began pumping water out of properties after the alert was raised at 08:00 GMT but no property was evacuated. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service had crews from Cardigan, Crymych, Fishguard, Newcastle Emlyn and Llandysul dealing with the incident. Ceredigion council said the county's flood plan has been put into operation and St Mary's church hall in Cardigan had been opened to residents. It said: \\"The rainfall experienced in the south of the county this morning was exceptional with rainfall intensities of 32mm per hour reported by the Met Office. \\"The highway surface water systems are designed to accommodate expected rainfall intensities but perhaps not the very exceptional rainfall circumstances as experienced earlier today.\\" Pembrokeshire council said it took more than 100 flood-related calls, with the north and north east of the county the worst affected, particularly St Dogmaels, Newport and Dinas. Fire crews were called to pump out water at five of the properties in Dinas, Solva and St Dogmaels. Natural Resources Wales had issued a flood warning for Solva but this has since been stood down. In a statement, Pembrokeshire council said: \\"Roads were reported flooded up to knee high in several places, and there were road closures at St Dogmaels and Devonshire Drive, near Tenby. \\"Many of the road flooding issues have been caused by debris dislodged in the heavy rain causing culverts to block. \\"Other problems have been caused by vehicles driving through deep water, causing 'bow waves' to wash into and flood properties. \\"Several of the flooded roads have had drain covers dislodged.\\" Surface water was reported on The Square at Fishguard, between West Street and High Street.

The domestication of the wild turkey can be attributed to the indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, particularly the Mayans and the Aztecs. The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is native to North America, and its domestication began in ancient Mesoamerica, around 800 BC to the early AD period. The Mayans and the Aztecs played a significant role in the domestication of wild turkeys, raising them for their meat and feathers. These domesticated birds were not only a source of food but also played a part in religious and ceremonial activities. The Mayans used the turkey's meat in everyday cooking and considered the birds sacred. In contrast, the Aztecs often used turkeys as ritual offerings to their gods, proving their deep cultural significance. Additionally, turkey feathers were incorporated into clothing, headdresses, and other items for decorative purposes. European explorers, like the Spanish conquistadors, came across domesticated turkeys during their explorations and conquests in the Americas. They took some of these birds back to Europe in the early 16th century, where they quickly gained popularity as a new source of poultry. The European domesticated turkeys diverged from their Mesoamerican counterparts due to selective breeding, creating the modern turkey variety we are familiar with today. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Who domesticated the wild turkey?\\" is a description that refers to the indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, specifically the Mayans and the Aztecs, who were responsible for the domestication of the wild turkey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the process step by step and the potential perturbation on the amount of salt removed from the water: 1. Place the water in a pot: The amount of salt in the water will initially affect the efficiency of the process, but in itself, it does not affect the efficiency of salt removal. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover: Suppose more salt drips inside the fresh water pot. This indicates that there might be an issue with the cover, as it is not supposed to allow salt to pass through. However, since the evaporated water is supposed to be salt-free, this perturbation should ideally have no effect on salt removal from the water. 3. Place a larger pot under the first: This step doesn't influence the amount of salt being removed from the water. 4. Heat water to evaporation: This step helps separate salt from the water. If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it would mean that the evaporated water is not salt-free, indicating that the evaporation process is not entirely efficient, and would result in less salt being removed from the water. 5. Water vapor will collect on the lid: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it suggests that the lid may not be functioning correctly, leading to less effective salt removal from the water. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, the perturbation suggests a lesser separation of salt from the water, resulting in reduced salt-removal efficiency. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, this could indicate that not enough salt is being left behind in the original pot, which would mean less salt is being removed from the water. Overall, if more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it will influence the process by reducing the efficiency of salt removal from the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Orca Movie plot: Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) is an Irish Canadian who catches marine animals to pay off the mortgage of his boat, and returns to Ireland. Nolan's crew is looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium, but a scientist named Ken (Robert Carradine) is targeted by the shark. An orca comes and kills the shark, saving Ken. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. While Nolan is on the journey with his crew, he tries to capture what he believes to be a bull orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently miscarries. The captain hoses the dead fetus overboard as the male orca looks on screaming. Seeking release of his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak (Keenan Wynn), cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea, too. The following day, the orca pushes his now dead mate onto shore. Alan Swain (Scott Walker) berates Nolan on his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as his presence is causing the fish vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorises the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking fuel lines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves. Dr. Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling), a colleague of Ken and a whale expert, shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that, \\"If he [the orca] is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.\\" Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathises with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. Nolan promises Bedford not to fight the whale, but the orca attacks his sea-front house, containing an injured crew member of Nolan's, Annie (Bo Derek) within it.

Which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence? The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? too long to shake","completion":"To determine whether the phrase \\"too long to shake\\" is considered positive or negative, I will first analyze the words and context in which the phrase could be used. Step 1: Analyze the words. \\"Too\\" -> implies an excess or something more than desired. \\"Long\\" -> in this context, it refers to a length, duration, or extent of something. \\"Shake\\" -> a common, physical action that could have different meanings depending on the context (e.g., shaking hands, shake off something). Step 2: Investigate potential contexts. Without any specific context, this phrase may be a bit ambiguous. It could refer to a handshake that lasted too long or the time taken to shake off dirt, thoughts, or emotions. Therefore, the context should be considered to better understand its connotation. Step 3: Determine the positive or negative sentiment. Assuming the most common context (handshake), \\"too long to shake\\" might describe an uncomfortable or awkward situation when a handshake lasts longer than socially accepted or desired. Based on these steps, I would say that the phrase \\"too long to shake\\" would generally be considered negative due to the excess implied by the word \\"too\\" and the potential awkwardness or discomfort associated with a prolonged action. However, the sentiment might vary if the phrase is used in a different context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: IN the 1960s, mainframe computers posed a significant technological challenge to common notions of privacy. That’s when the federal government started putting tax returns into those giant machines, and consumer credit bureaus began building databases containing the personal financial information of millions of Americans. Many people feared that the new computerized databanks would be put in the service of an intrusive corporate or government Big Brother. “It really freaked people out,” says Daniel J. Weitzner, a former senior Internet policy official in the Obama administration. “The people who cared about privacy were every bit as worried as we are now.” Along with fueling privacy concerns, of course, the mainframes helped prompt the growth and innovation that we have come to associate with the computer age. Today, many experts predict that the next wave will be driven by technologies that fly under the banner of Big Data — data including Web pages, browsing habits, sensor signals, smartphone location trails and genomic information, combined with clever software to make sense of it all. Proponents of this new technology say it is allowing us to see and measure things as never before — much as the microscope allowed scientists to examine the mysteries of life at the cellular level. Big Data, they say, will open the door to making smarter decisions in every field from business and biology to public health and energy conservation. “This data is a new asset,” says Alex Pentland, a computational social scientist and director of the Human Dynamics Lab at the M.I.T. “You want it to be liquid and to be used.” But the latest leaps in data collection are raising new concern about infringements on privacy — an issue so crucial that it could trump all others and upset the Big Data bandwagon. Dr. Pentland is a champion of the Big Data vision and believes the future will be a data-driven society. Yet the surveillance possibilities of the technology, he acknowledges, could leave George Orwell in the dust. The World Economic Forum published a report late last month that offered one path — one that leans heavily on technology to protect privacy. The report grew out of a series of workshops on privacy held over the last year, sponsored by the forum and attended by government officials and privacy advocates, as well as business executives. The corporate members, more than others, shaped the final document. The report, “Unlocking the Value of Personal Data: From Collection to Usage,” recommends a major shift in the focus of regulation toward restricting the use of data. Curbs on the use of personal data, combined with new technological options, can give individuals control of their own information, according to the report, while permitting important data assets to flow relatively freely. “There’s no bad data, only bad uses of data,” says Craig Mundie, a senior adviser at Microsoft, who worked on the position paper. The report contains echoes of earlier times. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, passed in 1970, was the main response to the mainframe privacy challenge. The law permitted the collection of personal financial information by the credit bureaus, but restricted its use mainly to three areas: credit, insurance and employment. The forum report suggests a future in which all collected data would be tagged with software code that included an individual’s preferences for how his or her data is used. All uses of data would have to be registered, and there would be penalties for violators. For example, one violation might be a smartphone application that stored more data than is necessary for a registered service like a smartphone game or a restaurant finder. The corporate members of the forum say they recognize the need to address privacy concerns if useful data is going to keep flowing. George C. Halvorson, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, the large health care provider, extols the benefits of its growing database on nine million patients, tracking treatments and outcomes to improve care, especially in managing costly chronic and debilitating conditions like heart disease, diabetes and depression. New smartphone applications, he says, promise further gains — for example, a person with a history of depression whose movement patterns slowed sharply would get a check-in call. “We’re on the cusp of a golden age of medical science and care delivery,” Mr. Halvorson says. “But a privacy backlash could cripple progress.”","completion":"\\"Big Data and Privacy: Navigating the Path to a Smart, Data-Driven Society\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. Answer:","completion":"Which policy change regarding cruise ships is being implemented by the city of Venice?

In the town where Donald lives discrimination happens to people like Brian often,","completion":"In the town where Donald lives, discrimination happens to people like Brian often, as they are unfortunately targeted and judged based on their ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, rather than being recognized for their individuality, character or the unique strengths they possess. This regrettable practice of discrimination stems from a combination of ignorance, stereotypes, and an inability to embrace diversity and acceptance within the community. The prevailing cultural norms and social prejudices that exist within the town subtly encourage this discriminatory behavior, creating an environment in which marginalized individuals like Brian must navigate their daily lives while constantly feeling unwelcome, judged, or alienated. Furthermore, this atmosphere breeds fear and mistrust, discouraging open communication and understanding between different groups, further perpetuating and reinforcing these negative attitudes. Institutional bias can also contribute to the discrimination faced by individuals like Brian. This systemic issue infiltrates various aspects of community life, from housing, education, and employment to healthcare and the criminal justice system. Consequently, many people who face discrimination may also experience significant disparities in access to resources, opportunities, and overall quality of life. The impacts of this discrimination extend beyond the immediate emotional distress it causes; they can manifest in long-term physical, psychological, and social consequences. Enduring the frustration, sadness, and anger that come with constant discrimination can lead to anxiety, depression, and even a sense of hopelessness. Such an environment may hinder the personal and professional growth of affected individuals, limiting their potential and aspirations. The constant struggle for acceptance and equal treatment can also strain relationships, not only within the families of the targeted individuals but also across the entire community, further dividing its inhabitants. To challenge and dismantle the existing discrimination in Donald's town, it is crucial for its residents to advocate for change and promote inclusivity. By creating safe spaces for open dialogue, where people can share their experiences and learn from one another, the community can collectively develop empathy, understanding, and respect for everyone's unique identities and perspectives. Education aimed at dispelling stereotypes and addressing prejudices is also essential, as it allows for the reconsideration of long-held, harmful beliefs. Moreover, local institutions should review their policies and practices to identify and eradicate any existing disparities in resources or opportunities. Legal support and protection must be available for individuals like Brian who experience discrimination, while those who perpetrate this unfair treatment must be held accountable. In conclusion, in the town where Donald lives, discrimination happens to people like Brian often, stemming from a complex interplay of ignorance, prejudice, and systemic bias. To create a more just, equitable, and inclusive society, it is imperative for all members of the community to engage in an ongoing process of education, dialogue, and advocacy, ensuring that no one is held back by unfair judgments or mistreatment based on superficial factors. Only then can people like Brian truly thrive and reach their full potential, ultimately enriching and strengthening the entire community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Why is the minister disappointed in the current commissioner, prompting him to bring in a new one? he has ties to the underworld A:","completion":"Title: Undercurrents Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Plot Summary: In the heart of the bustling metropolis, a city's grimy underworld threatens the lives of its citizens, seeping into the very corridors of power. Struggling to maintain the fragile balance of law and order, a bold and idealistic minister must confront his own sense of morality as he discovers that the commissioner at the helm of the police force has dangerous ties to the criminal networks ruling the city from the shadows. As the line between right and wrong begins to blur, the minister must make an impossible choice: should he preserve his own integrity, or risk the greater good to protect the city he loves? Plot: The movie opens with the city thriving with life, its streets lined with pedestrians and traffic. A news report plays in the background, highlighting the city's recent spike in crime, including a new criminal syndicate that has wormed its way into the core of the metropolis. The idealistic Minister of Security, Jonathan Reed, is shown standing on a rooftop, gazing out at cityscape with determination in his eyes. Commissioner Harold Dawson leads the city's police force, characterized by his brusque attitude and absolute control. Under his leadership, the crime rate has soared, with cases remaining unsolved and the city suffocating under the criminal syndicate's grip. Unbeknownst to the public, Dawson has made a deal with the syndicate's mysterious and powerful head: in exchange for his compliance and selective enforcement, Dawson receives immense financial benefit. One day, a dedicated undercover journalist named Amber Wright, whose own life had been marred by the tragedy of crime, uncovers the truth about Dawson's association with the criminal underworld. She risks her life to provide her findings to Minister Reed, who is stunned and horrified to learn of Dawson's treachery. This revelation throws Reed into internal turmoil - while he understands the dire consequences of removing the commissioner from power, he believes that he must uphold the values of truth and justice that he has sworn to serve. Reed makes the difficult decision to confront Dawson and demand his resignation. However, the commissioner, desperate to secure his position and retain the extralegal perks he enjoys, threatens to reveal Minister Reed's own personal and professional secrets, trapping him in a web of escalating tension and danger. Realizing that direct action against Dawson is untenable, Reed decides to recruit a new, fearless commissioner, named Samantha Vega, who is unaware of the complexities and deceit that shroud the city's administration. Samantha begins her term with the unwavering commitment to bring justice to the city, and despite Reed's initial reticence, he begins working closely with her. Together, they form an alliance, devising strategies to take down both Dawson and the criminal syndicate. This treacherous journey pushes Reed and Vega to the limits of their physical and moral capacities. As they confront the moral gray areas of their own actions, they realize the cost of pursuing justice is never black and white. In a thrilling and climactic confrontation, Reed and Vega are forced to battle the syndicate head, who has taken Amber Wright hostage in a derelict warehouse. As the stakes rise and the body count mounts, Reed and Vega stand on the precipice of justice, facing the choice between sacrificing the life of one journalist to take down the crime lord or risking the entire city's safety by saving her. Ultimately, they find a way to save Amber just as the syndicate's lair collapses, the crime lord arrested and Dawson's treachery exposed. The film closes with a shot of the city in the dawn light, a glimmer of hope in the darkness. As Reed and Vega watch the sunrise, they are simultaneously strengthened and humbled by their experiences, knowing the fight for justice is never-ending--but it is a fight they are willing to shoulder together. With hellfire behind them and battle-scarred hearts, they join hands and step into a future that, while uncertain, promises shining rays of hope for a city now in their care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question: What is probability theory ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is probability theory?\\" would be a description, as probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena and the quantification of uncertainty. It is a foundational element of many disciplines, including statistics, economics, finance, computer science, and physics. Probability theory focuses on the study of situations in which randomness and uncertainty play crucial roles. It provides a mathematical framework to understand the likelihood of various outcomes in such situations. The heart of the theory lies in the concept of a probability space, which is a mathematical model describing a random experiment and its possible outcomes. In probability theory, probabilities are assigned to events, which are sets of possible outcomes. The probabilities need to satisfy a few axioms, such as non-negativity, normalization, and additivity. As the name suggests, the non-negativity axiom requires the probability of any event to be non-negative. The normalization axiom states that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal one, reflecting the certainty that some outcome must occur. The additivity axiom stipulates that if two events are mutually exclusive (meaning they cannot both occur at the same time), the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their probabilities. Within the domain of probability theory, there are several different interpretations of probability, including the frequentist interpretation, the Bayesian interpretation, and the subjective interpretation. The frequentist interpretation, which is the most traditional, views probability as the long-run frequency of events in repeated trials of a random experiment. The Bayesian interpretation, on the other hand, views probability as a measure of an individual's rational degree of belief in the likelihood of an event. Finally, the subjective interpretation regards probability as a personal expression of uncertainty based on an individual's judgment and available information. Probability theory has numerous applications and is used in various fields. In statistics, for instance, it underlies the methods employed for making inferences and predictions from data. In engineering and science, probability theory is used for modeling and understanding the behavior of complex systems with randomness embedded within. In finance, it is widely used for risk management, asset valuation, and portfolio construction. In computer science, it plays a key role in the development of machine learning algorithms and the efficient design of algorithms that depend on randomness. In conclusion, the answer to \\"What is probability theory?\\" is a description of a mathematical theory concerned with understanding and quantifying randomness, uncertainty, and the likelihood of various outcomes in different situations. It is a fundamental aspect of numerous disciplines and has widespread applications throughout science, engineering, and social sciences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: colorado, eyrie, treetop, wilderness area, mountainous terrain Why is \\"mountainous terrain\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Mountainous terrain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand the natural habitat and behaviors of bald eagles to comprehend why this location is logical. Bald eagles are commonly found in North America, particularly in areas with access to water sources such as lakes and rivers, and often in regions with mountainous terrain. Thus, the geography associated with their habitat already connects them with mountainous landscapes. Secondly, bald eagles are well-known for their exceptional eyesight, which is around four to eight times sharper than that of humans. This superior vision allows them to spot prey from great distances. In a mountainous environment, they can perch high up on cliffs or treetops, granting them an elevated position with a panoramic view of their surroundings. This allows them to see for miles around, searching for potential sources of food or observing their territory against predators or competing eagles. A higher vantage point in a mountainous terrain provides a clear line of sight with minimal obstacles, making it easier for them to spot prey or potential threats. Moreover, mountainous terrains provide ample nesting opportunities for bald eagles. They frequently choose to build their nests in large trees or rocky cliffs, which can also be found in high altitude regions. In these locations, eagles are better protected from ground predators, and their nests are less likely to be disturbed by human activities. Comparing the possible answers provided - \\"Colorado\\" is a specific state where bald eagles can indeed be found, but it doesn't categorically answer the question about where a bald eagle could see for miles around. \\"Eyrie\\" refers to an eagle's nest, which could be in a location that offers visibility for miles, but it isn't as inclusive as mountainous terrain. \\"Treetop\\" can be an advantageous viewpoint for bald eagles in many places but is also not as broad an answer as mountainous terrain. Lastly, \\"wilderness area\\" is a more general term for unexplored and undisturbed natural environments, which could be suitable for eagles, but doesn't necessarily entail a high vantage point offering expansive views. Therefore, \\"mountainous terrain\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it encompasses several key factors: the natural habitat of bald eagles, the elevation and vantage points required for their superior vision to work effectively, the security of a high altitude nesting location, and the general adaptability of bald eagles within mountainous regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Ricciardo beat Rosberg by 0.169 seconds as Hamilton salvaged third after a troubled session in which he suffered an engine problem in final qualifying. The issue meant Hamilton only had one run to everyone else's two and could manage only 0.320secs off the pace. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took fourth ahead of Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live from 13:00 BST Hamilton had to be wheeled back to the Mercedes garage after his car lost power in the pit lane at the start of the top 10 shoot-out. But he was actually fastest of all in the first sector on his final lap of the session, after doing three build-up laps to try to get the ultra-soft tyres in the best condition. However, his pace dropped off in the final two sectors and he was left to rue yet another technical problem affecting his season. He is 43 points behind Rosberg in the championship, after problems affected his results in three of the first four races - all of which the German won - before the two crashed out together on the first lap in Spain two weeks ago. Hamilton said: \\"I don't really know what to say right now. It was a difficult qualifying but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap, so it is not as bad as some of the races have been. \\"I'm grateful to be up in third and I will do what I can to salvage what I can from today's result.\\" Ricciardo's pole time, the first of the Australian's F1 career, marks an impressive debut for a new, upgraded Renault engine which is worth an extra 30bhp. It is still not quite as powerful as Mercedes' engine but it is close enough for the excellence of the Red Bull chassis in slow corners to make up the difference. Allied to Ricciardo's liquid but exuberant attacking style, it made for a formidable combination around the demanding Monaco street circuit. \\"I knew coming into the weekend we had a strong chance and it looked good from Thursday,\\" Ricciardo said. \\"I feel like I have been driving well the last few races but hadn't got maximum reward. I came into the weekend feeling I could be in this position now. \\"It feels good. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package and it is nice to make the most of it.\\" Ricciardo has chosen an alternative strategy for the race - he will start the grand prix on the slower super-soft tyre, using the ultra-soft in the second stint. That means he can run longer before his pit stop and may be able to control the race even more easily than would anyway be the case from pole. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen crashed heavily early in the first session and will start 21st. The Dutchman, who won the last race in Spain on his debut for Red Bull, misjudged his entry to the second part of the Swimming Pool complex and clouted the barrier on the inside with his right front wheel. That broke his front suspension, and threw him across the track, over the kerbs of the second part of the corner and into the wall. The 18-year-old said: \\"Of course that is not the way you want to start for tomorrow. \\"I turned in a bit too early, broke the suspension and then couldn't recover from it. It's a case of misjudgement - that is all. A miscalculation - I just misjudged the grip a little bit.\\" Further down the field, McLaren's pre-event prediction that they would get both cars into the top 10 fell flat. Fernando Alonso did manage it, qualifying 10th, but team-mate Jenson Button was only 13th. McLaren were surprised by the pace of the Force India and Toro Rosso cars, who they had not expected to be so quick. Behind Hulkenberg, Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari was sixth, but will start 11th because of a five-place penalty for a gearbox change. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was seventh, ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, the second Toro Rosso of Danill Kvyat and Alonso.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under?, what is it ?

(CNN) -- About this time last year, many American families were sharing Thanksgiving leftovers and curious conversations about a traffic accident involving the world's most famous golfer. Almost a year has passed since the Tiger Woods' car accident outside his Florida home that spiraled into a sex scandal that dominated headlines, ended his marriage and caused him to take a break from golf. While his story last year was filled with scandal, talk around the Thanksgiving table this year may be more about redemption. \\"Obviously, this has been a very difficult year for me and my family, on and off the golf course,\\" Woods wrote this week on his official website.

Fast forward to almost a year since that fateful incident - it quickly spiraled into a massive sex scandal that not only dominated headlines but led to the end of Woods' marriage and a hiatus from his golfing career. While the conversations last year were centered around scandal, this year's Thanksgiving table talk may highlight themes of redemption. Tiger Woods acknowledged the hardships of the past year in a statement on his official website: \\"Obviously, this has been a very difficult year for me and my family, on and off the golf course.\\" Despite this public recognition, Woods has been tight-lipped when it comes to certain aspects of the saga, particularly declining to speak with Florida highway patrol troopers for a third time. This choice to maintain privacy in dealing with the Florida highway patrol troopers seems consistent with his overall approach to managing the repercussions of the sex scandal and his personal issues. Over the past year, Woods has taken slow, calculated steps towards repairing his public image and re-establishing his footing in both his personal life and professional pursuits. While Woods' management of the situation may be far from perfect, his efforts to address these issues openly, make amends, and push forward serve as a testament to his desire for redemption. For instance, he has sought therapy and reportedly devoted more time to being closer to his two children. As he gradually eases back into golf, Woods seems intent on rebuilding and redefining his brand and career. As time has passed, the focus has shifted from Tiger Woods, the unfaithful husband to Tiger Woods, the golf legend seeking redemption. Amidst the public scrutiny and personal turmoil, Woods has shown resilience in facing the consequences of his actions. This year's Thanksgiving conversations may revolve around Tiger Woods' journey and the challenges he has faced and overcome, proving that everyone deserves a chance at redemption. Will this road to redemption lead him back to the pinnacle of his golf career? That remains uncertain. However, what is evident is Woods' determination to navigate these murky waters and reintegrate himself into the world of golf, which continues to inspire a new round of conversations about growth, perseverance, and the power of human resilience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away.

Here is a detailed translation and analysis of the text: The passage discusses a double standard that exists with respect to the strict regulation of substances in the common market to protect the environment and health of European citizens, while on the other hand, allowing unrestricted trade with third countries without precautionary measures or any obligation for explaining the dangers involved. The key themes and components of the discussion are as follows: 1. Doppelmoral (double standard): This term points out the perceived hypocrisy in the regulation of substances within a shared market compared to trade with third countries. The passage argues that there should not be a double standard in these two scenarios. 2. Strenge Regelung einer Substanz (strict regulation of a substance): The passage highlights the strict regulations imposed on substances within the common market. These regulations are in place to protect the environment and health of European citizens. 3. Gemeinschaftsmarkt (common market): This term refers to the internal market within the European Union (EU) where goods, services, capital, and labor can move freely. This system has unified regulations that aim to promote competition and protect the interests of its citizens. 4. Schutz der Umwelt und der Gesundheit (protection of the environment and health): This phrase emphasizes the objective of the strict regulations within the common market, which is to safeguard the environment and health of the European citizens. 5. Handel mit Drittländern (trade with third countries): This refers to trade with countries that are not part of the EU's common market. The passage points out the contradictory position of having unrestricted trade with third countries, without any precautionary measures in place or an obligation to educate about potential dangers. 6. Vorsichtsmaßnahmen (precautionary measures): The text argues that precautionary measures should be taken when trading with third countries in the same way they are applied within the EU's common market. 7. Aufklärung über die Gefahren (explanation of the dangers): This phrase advocates for informing parties involved in trade with third countries about the potential hazards and risks associated with substances being traded, ensuring that they are aware of the possible consequences. In summary, the passage is in German and expresses concerns about the double standard in regulating substances within the EU's common market for the protection of the environment and health, while not applying the same level of precaution or transparency when trading with third countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Which farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds? A:","completion":"Valley farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds. In order to thoroughly understand the answer, let's take a closer look at the farming methods used by both farms. Hill farm relied on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) seeds. These seeds are created with desired traits such as higher yields, resistance to diseases, and resistance to herbicides. The main reason for using GMO seeds is to improve crop management, as they allow farmers to spray herbicides more efficiently without damaging the crops. In the case of Hill farm, genetically modified crops, which have been engineered to be herbicide-resistant, were chosen to achieve this goal. Valley farm, on the other hand, opted for organic methods and exclusively used non-GMO seeds. Organic farming follows strict regulations, ensuring that all materials used in the process are derived from natural sources and free of synthetic chemicals. Non-GMO seeds are those that have not been modified genetically but rather developed through traditional plant breeding techniques. While these non-GMO seeds might possess some natural resistance to certain pests and diseases, they would not have been specifically engineered to possess herbicide resistance as GMO seeds are. It is important to differentiate between organic and non-GMO farming practices. Both approaches avoid the use of GMOs, but organic farming also prohibits the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemically derived products. Valley farm followed organic farming methods, which means that they not only avoided using GMO seeds but also strictly abide by organic regulations for all aspects of their farming process. In summary, Valley farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds, as they chose non-GMO seeds in line with their organic farming approach. Hill farm, by using genetically modified seeds, purposefully opted for herbicide-resistant crops to improve crop management."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Great Simple n awesome\\" Answer:","completion":"★★★★★"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: Reuters - U.S. stocks hovered around thebreak-even mark, bonds fell and the dollar recovered a bit onTuesday just hours before the Federal Reserve was expected toraise U.S. interest rates for the fifth time this year.","completion":"The topic of this excerpt is focused on recent fluctuations within the U.S. financial markets, particularly surrounding the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year. In this situation, the U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar all experience notable changes as a result of this economic policy decision. To understand this topic in greater detail, we can break it down into several key components: 1. U.S. Stocks Market: The excerpt mentions that the stocks are hovering around the break-even mark, which indicates that investors may have mixed feelings about the effect of the upcoming interest rate hike on the stock market. A higher interest rate can lead to higher borrowing costs for companies, which in turn can lead to a decline in corporate earnings. This may put pressure on stock prices as investors worry about the potential negative impact on the companies they have invested in. Additionally, higher interest rates can also make fixed-income investments more attractive, potentially leading some investors to shift their money away from equities in search of safer, higher-yielding investments. 2. U.S. Bonds Market: Government bonds (such as treasury bonds) also face their own challenges arising from increasing interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices tend to fall – especially for bonds that have longer maturities. This is because as interest rates move higher, newly issued bonds will offer higher yields, which makes the older bonds less attractive to investors. As a result, the value of the older bonds falls on the market, leading to the decline in bond prices. 3. U.S. Dollar: The excerpt mentions that the dollar has recovered a bit ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. This is because interest rates hikes can influence the strength of a currency. When interest rates rise in a country, it typically attracts more investors, leading to an increased demand for the domestic currency. This increased demand can result in a positive effect on that country's currency, causing its value to rise in relation to other currencies. Therefore, the expectation of a U.S. interest rate hike could lead to a recovery in the value of the U.S. dollar. 4. Federal Reserve's Decision on Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve, as the central banking system of the United States, plays a significant role in steering the country's monetary policy, regulating financial institutions, and maintaining the stability of the financial system. One critical aspect of its responsibilities is determining the appropriate interest rate levels, which can have far-reaching effects on the economy. In this scenario, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the fifth time this year. This decision is likely driven by the ongoing recovery of the U.S. economy, attempts to keep inflation in check, as well as aiming to prevent the economy from overheating. In summary, the topic of this excerpt is focused on the interconnected nature of the U.S. financial markets and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year. As seen in the reaction of the stock, bond, and currency markets, increases in interest rates can create notable shifts in investor behavior, while also shaping the overall health and direction of the economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (CNN) -- The hidden skeleton of a woman who had been missing for 28 years came to light when a contractor cleaned out a vacant home in the Town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The gruesome find was uncovered behind a 'false wall' in the basement of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said. Joann Nichols' remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said Dr. Kari Reiber, the Dutchess County Medical Examiner. \\"The body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope. ... A large area of the right side of the skull was also missing,\\" Reiber said. Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said. Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was found Friday and were able to identify Nichols through dental records. An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, according to Reiber. Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at Gayhead Elementary School in Hopewell Junction New York, was reported missing on December 21, 1985, by her husband, James Nichols. Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center in the town. Police Chief Thomas Mauro said an intensive investigation followed, but the woman was never located. The case had remained open since 1985 and was reviewed annually by police, he said. James Nichols was found dead in the home on December 27 after concerned neighbors called police because they had not seen him in several days. He was 82 and died of natural causes, police said. Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris and garbage. No one in Nichols' family came forward to claim his body or take control of his estate, so Dutchess County Commissioner of Finance Pamela Barrack was appointed as temporary administrator, according to Barrack's attorney, Kelly Traver. \\"We were only able to locate two family members of Mr. Nichols, but they were not able to claim his body,\\" Traver said. Nichols was buried by the Dutchess County Department of Community and Family Services in an unknown location, Traver said. The Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department said it has not closed the case and will continue to examine the new forensic evidence. \\"It's now safe to say James Nichols is a suspect in this case,\\" said police Capt. Paul LeComte. The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.

In both sentences, Izumi is depicted as having drawn early character designs for Hibiki and then wanting to continue the story by starting a manga project with Maeda. In Sentence 1, the phrasing \\"with Maeda as the artist\\" suggests that Maeda is a specific, predetermined artist that has been chosen for this collaboration. It implies that Maeda has an established role or reputation as an artist, and Izumi is confident in their decision to work together on this project. In Sentence 2, the phrasing \\"with Maeda as an artist\\" places slightly less emphasis on Maeda's role in the project. It is more ambiguous about the nature of the collaboration and could imply that Maeda may be one of several artists considered for the project or that Maeda may be an aspiring artist or newly introduced to the project. This subtle difference in wording underlines the uncertainty over the exact nature of Maeda and Izumi's collaboration. In conclusion, both sentences convey similar information about Izumi's intentions to create a manga based on the character designs they initially drew for Hibiki.

Here is a goal: To keep your basement from smelling musty, How would you accomplish this goal? Possible answers: i. use a dehumidifier during humid months. ii. use a humidifier during humid months.","completion":"To accomplish the goal of keeping your basement from smelling musty, I would choose the option i. use a dehumidifier during humid months. Here are the steps and justifications: 1. First, I would identify when the humid months are in your specific location, as these can vary depending on geographic location and climate. This is important to know because high humidity levels can contribute to the musty smell in basements. 2. Once I know the humid months, I would purchase a dehumidifier if you don't already own one. A dehumidifier is an appliance that helps to remove excess moisture from the air, which is critical in reducing the mustiness in basements. The justification for choosing a dehumidifier over a humidifier is that a humidifier adds moisture to the air, which would exacerbate the musty smell rather than alleviate it. Using a dehumidifier during humid months will keep the humidity levels in the basement in check and reduce the likelihood of mold and mildew growth. 3. I would then determine the appropriate size and capacity of the dehumidifier needed for your basement. This depends on the size of the basement and the extent of the humidity problem. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the dehumidifier is effective at removing the excess moisture from the air and properly managing the humidity levels. 4. Once the dehumidifier is in place, I would monitor and maintain it regularly, emptying the collected water as needed and keeping filters clean. Ensuring proper maintenance of the dehumidifier is important to keep it functioning optimally and to prevent any additional issues from arising due to a poorly maintained appliance. 5. Finally, I would also recommend taking steps to improve air circulation in the basement, such as using fans or opening windows if possible. Increasing airflow can help to prevent stale air and moisture buildup, which contributes to the musty smell.

Question: who is the sox star knuckleball pitcher? Movie title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago... The answer is:","completion":"The Sox star knuckleball pitcher in the movie \\"Eight Men Out\\" is Eddie Cicotte. He was portrayed as one of the key players involved in the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal, also known as the \\"Black Sox Scandal.\\" Cicotte had an outstanding season with a 29-7 win-loss record and an earned run average of just 1.82. However, he becomes involved in the scheme to intentionally lose the World Series because team owner Charles Comiskey denied him a promised 10,000 bonus for winning 30 games that season. The movie \\"Eight Men Out\\" is based on the real-life events surrounding the 1919 Chicago White Sox, who were considered one of the greatest baseball teams at that time. Team owner Charles Comiskey's financial mistreatment of the players led to their dissatisfaction, which ultimately made them susceptible to the offers of gamblers Bill Burns and Billy Maharg. They end up conspiring with some of the players, including Eddie Cicotte, to intentionally lose the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for more money than they would have earned by winning. The movie presents a dramatized depiction of the events leading up to the scandal, the actual games, and the aftermath. Key characters in the story are Eddie Cicotte, Joe Jackson, Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, Lefty Williams, and Buck Weaver. The film showcases the players' struggles as they become involved in the scheme and face the consequences of their actions. In summary, the Sox star knuckleball pitcher in the film \\"Eight Men Out\\" is Eddie Cicotte, who played a crucial role in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. The movie provides an engaging portrayal of the real-life events and the personal struggles of the players involved in one of the most infamous scandals in the history of baseball.

Article: In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.

This article: Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year?, what is it ?

The Maritimes had a population of 1,813,102 in 2011. - Homer Dodge Martin (October 28, 1836 February 12, 1897) was an American artist, particularly known for his landscape paintings. Examples of Martin's work are in many important American museums. - Clarence Chatham Cook (September 8, 1828 June 2, 1900) was a 19th-century American author and art critic. - James Renwick Brevoort ( July 20 , 1832 -- December 15 , 1918 ) was an American artist known for his landscapes painted in the Hudson River School style . - Romanticism (also the Romantic era or the Romantic period) was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, and while for much of the Romantic period it was associated with liberalism and radicalism, its long-term effect on the growth of nationalism was perhaps more significant. - The Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement embodied by a group of landscape painters whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The paintings for which the movement is named depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and the White Mountains; eventually works by the second generation of artists associated with the school expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the American West, and South America. Overview. Neither the originator of the term \\"Hudson River School\\" nor its first published use has been fixed with certainty. The term is thought to have originated with the \\"New York Tribune\\" art critic Clarence Cook or the landscape painter Homer Dodge Martin.

Traditionally, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra plays what instrument?","completion":"Traditionally, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra plays the violin, specifically the first violin. The concertmaster holds a vital and prestigious position within the orchestra, having a significant impact on the overall performance and quality of the ensemble. The concertmaster serves as the leader of the first violin section and is typically the most skilled and experienced violinist in the group. This role comes with various important responsibilities, such as ensuring the entire orchestra's sound coherence and interpreting the conductor's musical intentions. Here are some additional duties of a concertmaster: 1. Leading the tuning process: Before the performance begins, the concertmaster initiates the process of tuning the entire orchestra. The oboist typically provides a reference pitch, usually the A440, and the concertmaster signals the other sections to follow suit. 2. Bowing coordination: The concertmaster is in charge of coordinating the bowing techniques and styles within the string sections to maintain a cohesive visual and auditory presentation. In collaboration with the section leaders and sometimes the conductor, the concertmaster may mark the bowings on their sheet music for the other players to follow. 3. Serving as the liaison between the conductor and the musicians: The concertmaster acts as a bridge between the conductor and the orchestra. They may clarify the conductor's instructions or address any concerns the musicians may have. 4. Representing the orchestra in public settings: The concertmaster often speaks on behalf of the ensemble during public events, award ceremonies, and other social engagements. 5. Taking on the role of a soloist: Occasionally, the concertmaster may be featured as a soloist in the orchestral repertoire. This can include violin concertos or pieces that highlight the talents of the first violinist. 6. Supporting the conductor during rehearsals: The concertmaster facilitates the rehearsal process by assisting with musical decisions, communicating the conductor's intentions, and helping maintain focus within the group. 7. Mentoring and supporting young musicians: In some instances, the concertmaster may also provide mentorship and guidance to young or new players in the orchestra, helping them acclimate to the ensemble setting. In conclusion, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra traditionally plays the first violin and is a critical figure within the musical ensemble. Serving as a leader, mediator, and artist, the concertmaster helps ensure a harmonious and cohesive performance, contributing significantly to the overall success of the orchestra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This arrangement raised concerns about the potential for conflict of interest and the ability of the committees to critically challenge and assess the government's performance. Reasons for the Change The decision to implement this policy comes as part of ongoing efforts to foster a more open and accountable political environment in Scotland. By limiting the involvement of MSP aides in the committees that scrutinize their bosses, it is believed that the transparency of the decision-making process will improve, thereby reducing possible biases and promoting public trust in political institutions. Effect on Committees Committees play a vital role in holding the government accountable for its actions and ensuring that policies align with the public's best interests. With the introduction of this new policy, these committees will be better equipped and more effective in carrying out their responsibilities. Eliminating potential conflicts of interest ensures that MSPs can maintain a more objective stance when evaluating and critiquing their superiors' initiatives. Benefits to the Public The public will also stand to gain from this reform as it increases confidence in the political system, ensuring that the scrutiny process is conducted without bias and in a manner that fosters integrity. In a time when skepticism and mistrust of political institutions are prevalent, policy changes such as these can help restore the public's faith in its governing bodies. Conclusion: Removing MSP aides from committees tasked with evaluating their bosses is a step in the right direction for promoting transparency and eliminating potential conflicts of interest in Scottish politics. By taking this initiative, the Scottish Parliament is sending a clear message that it is committed to upholding the principles of accountability and impartiality in its decision-making processes. This move will benefit both the government and the public by fostering a more transparent and effective system, bolstering the credibility of parliamentary committees, and increasing overall trust in political institutions."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This assumption is made based on the phrase \\"he held up his end of the deal,\\" which implies that Jordan has fulfilled his responsibilities or obligations in a particular agreement or deal. Naturally, he'd expect the other party involved to reciprocate and fulfill their part of the agreement. The other options, (ii). refuse to care about the deal and (iii). forget about the deal, seem less likely since Jordan is described as someone who always keeps his end of the deal.

She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted with jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, playing with his wolf siblings. One night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the \\"Man-Village\\" for his own safety. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a hungry python, tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a fight decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him back to the Man-Village. Shortly afterwards, a group of monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan. King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The task at hand appears to be analyzing the user's given queries and providing a detailed response to each of them. 1. \\"Why do women like to sleep on men's chests?\\" - This query is seeking a sociological and psychological clarification. Step 1: Analyze the question – The question is asking about a preference that some women might have. The preference might not be universal, implying that the reasons could vary largely based on individual experiences and contexts. Step 2: Generate a response - Based on sociological and psychological insights, the reasons can include seeking comfort, security, and a sense of intimacy. The physical closeness and the rhythmic sound of the beating heart can create a calming effect and induce sleep. 2. \\"Are men superior to women? If so, in what ways?\\" - This question is requesting an evaluation of the superiority concept in a gender context. Step 1: Analyze the question – It's important to note that the question implies a comparison between genders, potentially heading into a sensitive area hence should be handled with utmost care and respect for both genders. Step 2: Generate a response - If we were to use the principles of human rights and equality, it's crucial to stress that no gender is superior to the other. Both men and women can excel and show competence and superiority in different areas based on their individual skills, capabilities, and preferences. 3. \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\" - This question is prompting a linguistic and semantic analysis. Step 1: Analyze the question – A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. I would therefore need to evaluate if the two given questions have similar meanings but use different phrasing. Step 2: Generate the response - The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question pertains to a specific behavior that some women might show, while the second question asks for a comparison between men and women in terms of superiority. These are two distinct topics with different thematic implications."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Today, we are going to talk about a problem that some big banks in America have. You know how you have a piggy bank at home to save your money? Well, these big banks are like huge piggy banks where many people keep their money. But, these banks have a problem. They can't figure out how to save themselves. Let's learn more about it. Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a big problem in America called the \\"Financial Crisis.\\" A lot of people lost their money because these big banks made some mistakes. Since then, the people who make the rules said, \\"Okay, banks. Now, you have to be more careful with the money and keep some extra just in case.\\" But guess what? Even though the banks promised to be more careful, they are still having trouble doing that. They can't seem to figure out the best way to save themselves if another big problem like the Financial Crisis happens again. One of the reasons is that these big banks are like giant puzzles. They have lots of different parts, and they do many different things. Some parts of the bank lend money to people, while others help people invest their money. Because these banks have so many pieces, it's hard for them to see the whole picture and make the right choices. Another reason is that these big banks sometimes forget to work together. They might not share their ideas about how to save money with each other. Or, they might even compete with each other, like kids playing a game. But in this game, everyone needs to work together to make sure they don't lose their piggy banks. Some smart grown-ups have been thinking about how to help these big banks. They have some ideas like making the banks keep more money in their piggy banks, or encouraging them to work together as a team. In the end, these big banks need to learn how to make better choices and work together to keep everyone's money safe. Just like how you take good care of your piggy bank, they need to learn how to take care of the big piggy banks too. We hope you enjoyed learning about America's big banks and their problems! Remember, even big banks can make mistakes, but if they work together and learn from their mistakes, they can become better at keeping everyone's money safe.

Q: Abstract: Although osteoarthritis (OA) generally is considered a disorder of mechanical origin, the common occurrence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in the synovium in conjunction with immunofluorescent evidence for immune-reactant products in cartilage of surgical case specimens (knees, hips, and peripheral joints) has suggested the local involvement of immune processes in the arthritis. Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation.

Which movie is the following review about? FD2, despite some imaginative fatalities, is less a movie than a slick video game.","completion":"The review is about the movie \\"Final Destination 2,\\" released in 2003 and directed by David R. Ellis. This film is a sequel to the successful 2000 horror film \\"Final Destination\\" directed by James Wong. The franchise is well-known for its unique premise, which revolves around a group of people who miraculously escape a catastrophic event due to a premonition experienced by one of them, only to be hunted down and killed off one by one in a series of graphic and often elaborate accidents as death seeks to correct the disruption to its design. \\"Final Destination 2\\" follows a similar pattern to the first film; the protagonist, Kimberly Corman (played by A.J. Cook), experiences a premonition of a catastrophic multiple vehicle pile-up on a highway. She is able to prevent a group of people from being involved in the accident, only to later discover that they were meant to die. Like its predecessor, the movie is primarily focused on the elaborate death sequences and the tension as the characters try to figure out how to cheat death. The review is critical of the film, comparing it unfavorably to a \\"slick video game\\" instead of a traditional film experience. This perspective can be due to the movie's insistence on showcasing imaginative and intricate fatalities. The movie heavily relies on these death scenes, which serve as the main attraction for the audience seeking thrills and suspense. While these set-pieces may be inventive and visually appealing, they do not entirely make for a cinematic experience that prioritizes character development, storytelling, and meaningful dialogue. Moreover, the \\"slick video game\\" comparison may extend to the movie's aesthetics, which are characterized by polished visuals, fast-paced editing, and exaggerated camera movements, resembling a frenetic energy commonly found in video games. The franchise continued to follow this format up until its fifth installment, \\"Final Destination 5,\\" released in 2011. Consequently, some viewers may find this approach lacking the substance or depth they expect from a full-length feature film. To summarize, the review is about the movie \\"Final Destination 2,\\" criticizing its emphasis on inventive death scenes and visual style over a more traditional narrative structure and character development. This approach, while potentially entertaining for fans of the genre, leaves the movie feeling more like a \\"slick video game\\" than a memorable film experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the answer: Which radioactive element, atomic number 89, is the first alphabetically in a list of naturally occurring elements?","completion":"The radioactive element with an atomic number of 89, and the first alphabetically in a list of naturally occurring elements, is Actinium. Actinium is a silver-colored, radioactive, metallic element that was discovered in 1899 by the German chemist Friedrich Oskar Giesel. Its name is derived from the Greek word \\"actinos,\\" which means \\"beam\\" or \\"ray,\\" reflecting its radioactive nature. Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ores and thorium ores. It is usually produced as a byproduct of uranium decay in a nuclear reactor. Due to its scarcity on Earth, the element has limited applications, but it does serve as a neutron source and has shown potential uses in cancer treatment. Actinium has 29 known isotopes, ranging from Ac-206 to Ac-234. The most stable isotope is Actinium-227, with a half-life of approximately 21.77 years. Actinium-227 decays to Francium-223 by emitting alpha particles, as well as to Thorium-227 by beta decay. These radioactive decay processes can produce hazardous levels of radiation, necessitating careful handling when working with Actinium. Due to its radioactive nature, Actinium's uses are primarily limited to research and specialized industrial settings. One of the most prominent applications of Actinium is in the production of neutrons. When Actinium is bombarded with neutrons, it produces great amounts of additional neutrons, which can be used in various experiments and processes. One of the most promising applications of Actinium is in the medical field. Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) utilizes Actinium-225, an alpha-emitting isotope, to target and destroy specific cancer cells without damaging nearby healthy tissues. Actinium-225, due to its short half-life of approximately 10 days, decays quickly, minimizing long-term side effects. In summary, Actinium, with atomic number 89, is the first naturally occurring element alphabetically in a list of elements. It is a radioactive metal discovered in 1899, and while it has limited applications, it does serve as a neutron source in various processes and demonstrates promise in cancer treatment through Targeted Alpha Therapy. Given its radioactive nature, handling Actinium safely requires extreme care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Nightmare Before Christmas Movie plot: Pumpkin king Jack Skellington (speaking voice Chris Sarandon, singing Danny Elfman), an elegantly attenuated skeleton, has delivered another scary Halloween. But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don't seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including \\"Sandy Claws\\" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they're taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs. The evil scientist must whip up some reindeer, Halloweentown's top trick-or-treaters are to kidnap Sandy Claws, and Sally's task is to make Jack a red Santa suit. She tries to tell him that co-opting Christmas is a terrible idea, but he's too wrapped up in his enthusiasm to listen.The three trick-or-treaters return triumphantly with the Easter Bunny; Jack sends them back and eventually they bring him Sandy Claws (who surprises Jack by having hands rather than claws). Jack directs the trick-or-treaters to take Sandy Claws away and make him comfortable, but they give him to Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) instead.Meanwhile, Sally has produced a red...

One week after the burial of Robert and Katherine Thorn (in the first Omen movie), archeologist Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) asks his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) to deliver a box to the guardian of Thorn's young son, Damien. He reveals that Damien is the Antichrist and that the box contains a warning and the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to the ruin of Yigael's wall, showing him an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face. Morgan is convinced, but the two are buried alive as a tunnel collapses.Seven years later, 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant) at a large house outside of Chicago, Illinois. He gets along well with his 15-year-old cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, he is despised by Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who favors Mark and thinks Damien a bad influence, even threatening to cut Richard out of her will if he does not separate the two boys. The same night, the appearance of a raven wakes her up and causes a fatal heart attack.Through a friend, Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor), who is the curator of the Thorn Museum, Richard is introduced to journalist Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shephard), who was a colleague of Keith Jennings (from the previous film). Having seen Yigael's Wall and drawing a link to all the deaths that surrounded Damien, including Jennings', Joan tries to warn Richard but he throws her out of his limo. After a confrontation with Warren and Ann Thorn at the Thorn Museum, Joan became unsure on whether Damien's face matches the painting on Yigael's Wall. Joan goes to meet Damien at his school, but when she sees his face she drives off in panic. On the road, her car mysteriously dies down.

Morgan Stanley Sees Daylight Morgan Stanley enjoyed a two-day respite at the end of this week from the seemingly inexorable selling pressure that sent its shares down 83.2% since last autumn, but that doesn't mean the securities house is out of the woods. It may yet lose its independence, but it can afford to be a little discrminating in its choice of partners. After trading as low as 11.70 on Thursday, before the U.S. government began bailing out America's financial industry in earnest, Morgan Stanley closed the week at 27.21, up 44.66, or 20.7%, on Friday. Enthusiasm that Morgan Stanley (nyse: MS - news - people ) could avoid the fate of Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, was spurred Friday morning after Merrill Lynch (nyse: MER - news - people ) analyst Guy Moszkowski said the likelihood had increased that it would link up with commercial bank Wachovia (nyse: WB - news - people ). Wachovia's shares soared 29.3%, or 4.25, to 18.75. But Wachovia isn't the only hope. Morgan Stanley seems to be in discussions with anyone who will listen, and, Reuters quoted a source as saying, the firm is also trying to remain independent. Still , Chief Executive John Mack of Morgan Stanley has reached out to China's Citic Group, Wachovia, and Singapore Investment, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, said the source. As have other leading Wall Street brokers over the past week, Morgan Stanley has been feeling the pain as its stock plunged on investor fears about the credit crisis that began in America's subprime mortgage market. The good news is that regulators, law enforcement and major pension funds declared war on short-sellers on Thursday as they tried to put a stop to the panic gripping Wall Street, sparking a rally in shares. (See  War On Shorts.) Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York said he would use the state's Martin Act to pursue criminal fraud charges against short-sellers found to be manipulating shares in major financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers (nyse: LEH - news - people )American International Group (nyse: AIG - news - people ), Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people ) and Morgan Stanley.

(Associated Press) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte gestures while addressing the media following the conclusion of the 30th ASEAN Leaders' Summit in Manila, Philippines, Saturday, April 29, 2017. Duterte suggested... (Associated Press) MANILA, Philippines (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has called Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte and expressed Washington's commitment to their treaty alliance and his interest in developing \\"a warm, working relationship,\\" a Filipino official said Sunday. Presidential spokesman Ernie Abella said Trump mentioned he was looking forward to visiting the Philippines in November to attend an East Asia summit that Duterte will host with several world leaders and that Trump invited Duterte to visit the White House. \\"The discussion that transpired between the presidents was warm, with President Trump expressing his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter of dangerous drugs,\\" Abella said in a statement. A White House statement described late Saturday's call as \\"very friendly\\" and said the U.S.-Philippine alliance \\"is now heading in a very positive direction.\\" Abella's remarks reflect the friendlier attitude Duterte has taken with Trump versus the antagonistic stance he had toward President Barack Obama, who he once asked to \\"go to hell\\" for criticizing the Philippine leader's bloody anti-drug crackdown. During Obama's final months in office, the Philippine president moved to build closer economic ties with China and Russia while repeatedly threatening to end his nation's longstanding military alliance with the U.S. Duterte's apparent dislike for Obama began when the U.S. State Department expressed concern over his drug war — which has left thousands of suspects dead — and asked Philippine government officials to take steps to stop extrajudicial killings. At one point Duterte suggested he may even move to abrogate a 2014 defense agreement that allows U.S. military access to five Philippine military camps. He has walked back most of those threats but has proceeded with his efforts to align closer with China. On Sunday, three Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer and a guided-missile frigate, were welcomed in Davao city, Duterte's southern hometown, by officials, including presidential daughter and city Mayor Sarah Duterte, military officials said. Asked if the rare Chinese naval visits were a sign that Duterte was backing away from Washington, Department of National Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said: \\"We are not veering away from the U.S. but rather we are expanding our relations with our fellow nations in the global community.\\" Abella said without elaborating that concern over North Korea also came up in Trump's talk with Duterte. Duterte suggested in a news conference Saturday that the Trump administration should back away from an intensifying standoff with North Korea, not in surrender, but to avoid risking a nuclear holocaust that could smother Asia. \\"It would be good for America to just restrain a little bit and if I were President Trump, I'll just back out, not really in surrender and retreat, but just to let the guy realize that, 'Ah, please do not do it.'\\" Duterte said. Washington, he said, should not play into provocations of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \\"It behooves upon America, who wields the biggest stick, just to really be prudent and patient. We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes letting go of his missiles and everything,\\" Duterte said. ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump invited his polarizing Philippines counterpart to the White House during a phone call in which the two leaders discussed North Korea. Trump and President Rodrigo Duterte had a \\"friendly discussion\\" Saturday that also addressed regional security in Southeast Asia and the Philippines' drug war, the White House said in a statement. The statement did not provide details on when or if Duterte would visit Washington, but it said Trump is looking forward to his Philippines trip in November. This man compares himself to Hitler This man compares himself to Hitler 01:21 This man compares himself to Hitler The invitation spurred questions about whether the White House should extend a visit to a leader who has been much criticized for alleged human rights abuses, such as extrajudicial killings in Duterte's war on drugs. Priebus agreed that human rights matter but he argued that the North Korean problem takes precedence. \\"The issues facing us developing out of North Korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row,\\" he said. \\"We have got to be on the same page.\\" Escalating tensions with North Korea The US military has moved an aircraft carrier strike group into the region, docked a powerful nuclear submarine in South Korea and staged large military drills with South Korea and Japan. Trump said Thursday there was \\"a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea,\\" but added he would prefer a diplomatic resolution. 'Dangerous toys' Before his phone call with Trump, Duterte said the world would suffer if the United States and North Korea -- led by Kim Jong Un -- could not defuse the situation. \\"Everybody suffers, only because two nations are playing with their dangerous toys. It behooves a certain America, because it is the more responsible country. I'm sure President Trump by now must also be cautioning his military to just maybe hang on and not to start something they cannot control,\\" Duterte said. Duterte urged the US to be patient and practice restraint. \\"We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes in letting go his missiles. I would not want to go into his mind because I really don't know what is inside. But he is putting Mother Earth, the planet, on the edge,\\" he said. In a statement issued after the phone call, the White House said Trump invited Duterte to the White House to discuss the US-Philippines alliance \\"which is now heading in a very positive direction.\\" \\"They also discussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.\\" Duterte's tirades Duterte's term has been marked with accusations of human rights violations. Since he became President last year, he has encouraged the extrajudicial killings of thousands of citizens suspected of dealing or using drugs. He took power in June 2016 and waged an all-out \\"war on drugs,\\" which killed some 6,000 people in his first six months. In December, he admitted to having suspected criminals killed when he was mayor of Davao City. Duterte's tirades have raised many eyebrows since he took office. While on a trip to China in October, he said \\"America has lost,\\" and that he has realigned himself with China's \\"ideological flow.\\" He later clarified his comments about relations with the United States, saying he was rather pursuing a \\"separation of foreign policy\\" from the US. Obama had previously raised concerns about Duterte's controversial war on drugs and his human rights record. Photos: Rodrigo Duterte has said some outrageous things.

Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'.

Sentence from a movie review: enthusiastic Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence \\"enthusiastic\\" from the movie review, it is more likely that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. Enthusiasm usually implies excitement or approval towards something, which leads to the assumption that the reviewer had a favorable impression of the movie. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the overall tone of the review. In general, movie reviews can provide valuable insights into the quality of a film, its plot, characters, cinematography, and other aspects that contribute to the overall movie-watching experience. Reviewers typically use a wide range of adjectives, verbs, and phrases to convey their opinions on a film, so it's essential to pay close attention to the context and the reviewer's choice of words to ensure an accurate understanding of their perspective. Words like 'enthusiastic,' 'captivating,' 'impressive,' and 'engaging,' for instance, would more likely indicate a positive review, while terms such as 'lackluster,' 'disappointing,' 'forgettable,' or 'confusing' imply a negative evaluation. Furthermore, it's crucial to consider factors such as possible biases, personal preferences, and narratives surrounding a movie, as these can also influence a reviewer's take on a film. Sometimes, even in a positive review, specific aspects of the movie may have been seen as less appealing (or vice versa for a negative review). Therefore, while the term \\"enthusiastic\\" within the given review implies that the film has been reviewed positively, it is important to examine the review in its entirety to form a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's stance. This approach will enable you to gauge the overall sentiment of the review and whether the movie was appreciated or criticized by this particular reviewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Resistance in this context is affected by the physical dimensions of the material - here it is wire (or in this case, an aluminum foil cylinder). So, when Robin is using the aluminum foil to make small cylinders, a foil cylinder of a smaller diameter (thinner) will offer more resistance. Since our 1cm diameter cylinder is thinner than our 10cm diameter cylinder, it will offer less resistance than the 10cm one.

Use an air conditioning unit that’s strong enough to cool the room. Article:","completion":"Title: Effective Cooling Strategies: Combining Fans, Ice, Cross-Breezes, and Air Conditioners Introduction As summer approaches and temperatures soar, many of us are looking for effective ways to keep our living spaces cool and comfortable. While air conditioning units are often the go-to solution, there are several additional strategies that you can employ alongside your air conditioning system to ensure that your home stays cool and energy-efficient. In this article, we discuss these strategies, which include using fans and ice, creating a cross-breeze with multiple fans, and selecting an adequately powerful air conditioning unit. Turning on a Fan Fans, either standing or mounted on the ceiling, are often underestimated when it comes to keeping a room cool. While they do not actually lower the temperature of the room, fans circulate the air and create a breeze that can make it feel cooler. This is because the air movement allows sweat to evaporate more quickly, which helps our bodies to regulate temperature more effectively. Using a fan in combination with your air conditioning system can be beneficial in two ways. First, the fan can evenly distribute the cool air produced by the air conditioner, ensuring that every part of the room feels comfortable. Second, using a fan can help you save energy and reduce energy bills, as circulating the air allows you to set your air conditioner to a higher temperature without sacrificing comfort. Placing Ice Cubes in Front of a Running Fan While a fan on its own can make a room feel cooler, you can further enhance its cooling effect by placing a bowl of ice cubes or a frozen gel pack in front of the running fan. As the ice melts, the fan will blow the cool air generated from the melting process around the room. This can create an additional cooling sensation and is an especially useful technique if you do not have air conditioning or are trying to reduce your use of it. Creating a Cross-Breeze with Two Fans A cross-breeze is a simple yet effective strategy to cool a room, as it involves using two fans to create air movement in multiple directions. To implement this tactic, place one fan near a window or doorway that is open to the outside, and the other fan on the opposite side of the room, near another open window or doorway. This setup will encourage fresh, cooler air from outside to enter the room, while simultaneously pushing stale, warm air out. This technique is most successful when used in conjunction with other cooling strategies mentioned earlier, as it helps to distribute the cool air produced by the air conditioning unit more effectively. Choosing a Powerful Air Conditioning Unit When selecting an air conditioning unit, it is crucial to choose one that is properly sized and powerful enough to cool the area of your home that you intend it to serve. Underestimating the cooling capacity needed can result in an inefficient system that struggles to lower the temperature and wastes energy in the process. To ensure you select the right air conditioning unit, consult an HVAC specialist to help you measure the square footage of the space you need to cool and determine the cooling capacity needed in BTUs (British Thermal Units). This will help you make an informed decision and choose an air conditioning system that matches your cooling needs. Conclusion When it comes to keeping your home cool during the hot summer months, combining different cooling strategies such as fans, ice, cross-breezes, and air conditioning units can lead to a more comfortable and energy-efficient living space. Not only will these techniques help keep your home pleasant, but they can also lower your energy consumption and save you money in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: In the latter half of the 16th century, the Sultanate of Demak, the dominant power in the island of Java, disintegrated into several independent states. At the turn of the 17th century, three of these states emerged as the leading powers: the Sultanate of Banten in western Java, the Sultanate of Mataram in inland central Java, and the Duchy of Surabaya in coastal eastern Java. Mataram consolidated its power by absorbing other principalities: Pajang in c. 1588, Demak , Madiun and Kediri . Following Mataram's unsuccessful westward expedition against Banten in about 1597, Mataram turned its expansion eastward, into areas under the influence of Surabaya. The Duchy of Surabaya was centered roughly in today's city of Surabaya in the northern coast of eastern Java. It was a wealthy and powerful state, and the city was an important port in the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands., The city was approximately 37 kilometres in circumference, and was fortified by canals and cannons. Allied with the nearby state of Pasuruan, the Duchy expanded its influence throughout the eastern part of Java in the beginning of the 17th century. By 1622, it was in control of Gresik and Sedayu in eastern Java. It was also the overlord of Sukadana and Banjarmasin in southern Borneo. More doubtful reports said it might have also extended its influence to Pasuruan, Blambangan, the Brantas valley region, and Wirasaba.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened second: Golden Horde attacked Poland or Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas?","completion":"Title: The Sequence of Events: Golden Horde's Attack on Poland and Liubartas's Rule Over Volhynia Introduction In medieval Eastern European history, two significant events captured the attention of scholars and history enthusiasts alike: the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's reign over Volhynia. Although both took place in the mid-14th century, it is essential to pinpoint which event happened first. To answer this question, let's delve into the historical records and piece the events in their chronological order. The Golden Horde's Attack on Poland In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan, began conquering vast territories. One of its division, the Golden Horde, under the rule of Batu Khan, subdued various Slavic groups. The Golden Horde first invaded Poland in 1241 during the reign of Bolesław V The Chaste and conquered Kraków, Poland's capital at the time. In the decades that followed, the Horde orchestrated numerous attacks on Polish territories, attempting to weaken and conquer it. The last substantial invasion took place in 1340, under the command of Ozbeg Khan. This invasion prompted Casimir III, known as Casimir the Great, who ruled Poland from 1333-1370, to bolster the country's defensive capabilities. The Horde's attack forced Poland to abandon, at least temporarily, its interest in the neighboring region of Volhynia. Liubartas's Reign Over Volhynia Meanwhile, Volhynia, a historic region straddling modern-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus, experienced significant internal strife and political turmoil throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. At the time, the Mongol Empire began to weaken, and the Golden Horde gradually lost its influence over various territories, including Volhynia. Many rulers sought to gain power and control over the resource-rich area. Liubartas was one such ruler who sought to control Volhynia. Born to Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Liubartas inherited the western part of the region after the Treaty of 1320. His brother, Algirdas, inherited the eastern part of Volhynia. However, the decisive moment when Liubartas officially became the ruler of all of Volhynia occurred in 1340 when his brother Algirdas transferred the eastern part of the region to him, uniting Volhynia under Liubartas's rule. Sequence of Events Given these historical contexts, it becomes evident that the Golden Horde's attack on Poland in 1340 happened before Liubartas's full ascension to power over the united Volhynia. The invasion forced Poland temporarily to shift its focus from Volhynian territory, providing a favorable environment for Liubartas to establish control and unite the region under his rule. Thus, the Golden Horde's attack on Poland occurred before Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas in that same year. Conclusion While both the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's full acquisition of Volhynia took place in 1340, historical records indicate that the former event preceded the latter. This timeline clarifies a substantial moment in Eastern European history and sheds light on the complex political climate of the era. Understanding these chronological intricacies helps to comprehend the context and consequences of these pivotal events in the region's history."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Russian language Russian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of the consonants. While /k/, /ɡ/, /x/ do have palatalized allophones [kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ], only /kʲ/ might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive (the only native minimal pair which argues for /kʲ/ to be a separate phoneme is \\"это ткёт\\" ([ˈɛtə tkʲɵt], 'it weaves')/\\"этот кот\\" ([ˈɛtət kot], 'this cat')). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of /tʲ/ and /dʲ/, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds). These sounds: /t, d, ts, s, z, n and rʲ/ are dental, that is pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the alveolar ridge. Q: How are 'dental' sounds pronounced?","completion":"\\"Dental\\" sounds are pronounced by using the tip of your tongue and touching it to your upper teeth. This helps make certain noises, like /t/, /d/, /ts/, /s/, /z/, /n/, and /rʲ/.

Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why did the narrator always go to her officer ?","completion":"The passage does not explicitly state the reason why the narrator always goes to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints; however, we can infer some reasons by analyzing the provided context. One possible reason the narrator goes to her officer is to maintain a sense of decorum and hierarchy within her unit or team. By bringing her concerns and issues to her commanding officer instead of discussing them with those under her command, she is respecting the chain of command and ensuring that the approved protocol is followed. This approach demonstrates her understanding of her role in the organizational structure and helps maintain discipline within the team. Another possible reason behind this decision is the narrator's belief in the importance of appearing firm, confident, and strong to those she commands. To achieve this goal, she refrains from discussing her struggles or complaints with her subordinates, as doing so might undermine their confidence in her leadership ability. Instead, she relies on her commanding officer for support and guidance, which is a more appropriate outlet for addressing her concerns and maintaining her composed demeanor. Lastly, turning to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints could be a means for the narrator to seek valuable feedback, guidance, and mentorship. The commanding officer's experience and seniority within the organization make them a vital resource in helping the narrator address her concerns, navigate professional challenges, and grow in her role as a leader. In summary, the narrator always goes to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints in order to uphold the chain of command, preserve her image as a strong leader in front of her subordinates, and seek valuable guidance and support from a more experienced and higher-ranking individual within the organization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Context_2 : Darwin: The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist is a biography of Charles Darwin by Adrian Desmond and James Moore. It is considered one of three scholarly biographies of Darwin, along with \\"Charles Darwin: The Man and His Influence\\" (1996) by Peter J.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

Phillips auditioned in Savannah, Georgia. He sang \\"Superstition\\" by Stevie Wonder.

On February 23, 2012, Phillips was chosen as one of the Top 25 semi-finalists, and was then voted into the Top 13. His performance style on the show has been compared to Dave Matthews, and he covered one of his songs, \\"The Stone,\\" in the competition. When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges.

For his Top 3 performance, Phillips sang Bob Seger's \\"We've Got Tonight.\\" For Top 4, he did a cover of Damien Rice's Volcano - which has been heralded as one of the best American Idol performances of all time. As the sole contestant who was never in jeopardy of elimination in any week of the competition, Phillips became the winner on the finale against Jessica Sanchez after a record-breaking 132 million votes were cast. His coronation song, \\"Home,\\" was released after his performance, and had the biggest digital sales week for any Idol winner's coronation song. ^Note 1 Due to the judges using their one save on Jessica Sanchez, the Top 7 remained intact for another week.

Christmas-Tree Sales Spread Good Tidings OAK PARK, Ill.—Sandhill Christmas Trees here sells fewer than 5,000 firs in a typical holiday season but this year it sold nearly 6,000, many as last-minute deliveries to retailers who had underestimated demand. John Brussock, center, with his father, James Brussock, left, and friend Ben Emmrich at Sandhill Christmas Tree Farm in Marquette County, Wis. \\"Dad would be proud that we went out and had a record year,\\" said John Brussock, who at age 24 just completed his rookie season as chief executive of Sandhill after taking over for the founder, his father, James Brussock, who died earlier this year. Sandhill's success mirrors that of tree farms across the U.S. Precise numbers won't be available until late winter, when the National Christmas Tree Association completes its annual survey. But after two flat seasons, tree-farm associations in the biggest-producing states say members are estimating an industry-wide sales jump in the mid- to high single digits over a year ago, with some growers reporting larger gains. \\"At times during the season, we had growers reporting increases of 20% to 40%,\\" said Brian Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, whose territory includes Oregon, the nation's largest producer of Christmas trees. With annual sales under 2 billion, the Christmas tree is a small but nevertheless telling economic indicator because when incomes fall, people tend to forgo buying trees, economists say. \\"Better sales would be a good supporting indicator for better consumer sentiment,\\" said Michael Swanson, agricultural economist for Wells Fargo & Co. At Sandhill, this year's sales boost also reflects a son's determination to embrace a family business his father called \\"an out-of-control hobby.\\" Like many Christmas-tree farmers, the elder Mr. Brussock got into it as a sideline. The owner of a kitchen-remodeling business in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, James Brussock decided about 30 years ago to start growing Christmas trees on 200 acres he owned in southern Wisconsin. The project required endless toil—planting, fertilizing, shearing—with no quick payoff because the first crop of trees took eight years to mature. Even after sales took off, the burly, white-bearded Mr. Brussock limited the operation's growth so it wouldn't interfere with his day job. Yet growing and selling Christmas trees gave him great pleasure. A devoted outdoorsman, he loved working fields of Frasers and Balsams. Selling the trees from the asphalt parking lot of his remodeling firm, he also treasured the local renown it brought his family. \\"Our kids just know the Brussocks as the Christmas tree people,\\" said Lisa Hendrix, an Oak Park schoolteacher who has been buying Brussock trees for years. Even as a toddler, John Brussock worked the farm and sold trees alongside his dad. But after graduating with an economics degree from the University of Wisconsin, he took a job selling commercial real estate in Chicago. In 2008, his father manned the tree lot alone. John, missing the outdoors and physical work, returned the next year and started an online sales business. His father was delighted. \\"I don't know that there's anything better in life than working with your son,\\" Mr. Brussock said in interviews for an article published last year in The Wall Street Journal. In early 2009, the elder Mr. Brussock had been diagnosed with bile-duct cancer. Doctors predicted it would kill him before Labor Day. \\"I want another Christmas,\\" his wife, Kitty, recalled him saying. James and John worked the sales lot together through last year's holidays. This summer, they tended trees side-by-side in the fields. \\"I was shearing with him, and that is hot, strenuous work,\\" said John Brussock. His father died Sept. 4 at the age of 65. The younger Mr. Brussock intends to make a full-time career out of Christmas trees, as his father had dreamed of doing. Thanks to his dad, John said, \\"Christmas trees are my passion.\\" With a farm planted with 75,000 trees, John Brussock aims to more than triple Sandhill sales over the next few years by increasing both Internet and wholesale revenue. \\"There are always new people opening Christmas tree lots, and we have a reputation for quality trees,\\" he said. Before his father died, John Brussock peppered him with questions on things like the per-acre formula for spraying herbicide. But some business details got lost. One recent day, Mr. Brussock wondered where his father stored the spare tire for a tree-hauling trailer. He reached for his cellphone to call his dad, only to remember he was now on his own.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

At that point, any trades that are not verbally confirmed will be generated and sent. (This does not preclude the need for you to follow up with deals not yet verballed).

They almost got away with it were it not for a police power boat that caught up with the dumb duo some nine miles downstream. The paddlers were nabbed and brought back to dry land where they were placed into police custody. Fugitives: Garrett Eure, and Jessie Bryant, both 23, attempted to flee cops by floating their way to freedom. You too: Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, Eure's girlfriend was also arrested. Garrett Eure, 23, of Gainesville, was wanted for failure to appear on an escape charge and the other fugitive was Jessie Bryant, 23, of Fort Pierce, who was wanted on various charges. For a time,the fugitives managed to elude authorities for about five hours as they used wooden paddles to sail down the river for nine miles. The U.S. Marshals Service contacted the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on Monday to say that Eure was living in Madison. Investigators determined that Eure was living in a house in Lee with Bryant, who was wanted in St. Lucie County for charges of armed burglary coupled with assault and battery by strangulation. A couple of floaters: The pair got nine miles down the Withlacoochee River. Dumb couple: Garrett Eure, 23 and his girlfriend Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville were both arrested. She was released on bail whilst Euro is being held on 100,000 bond. Bryant was arrested on warrants for burglary and battery. Zabriskie was also arrested on charges of resisting arrest without violence. Eure’s girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville, was with them. Eure and Bryant suspected that authorities had found them and they ran to the Withlacoochee River, climbed into a canoe and tried to escape. Officials used dogs to track the fugitives on foot and then started up a motorboat to chase them on the river. The small blue canoe the men used was filled with a cooler and several backpacks, said Russell Williams, a freelance photographer who was present during the arrests. As dumb as each other: The two fugitives Garrett Eure, 23, were living with his girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie,21, pictured here. Getaway vehicle: The two men tried to run, or rather, paddle from the law in a two-man canoe. The police soon caught up with them nine miles down the river. Mr Williams added that deputies at the scene said they had been to Zabriskie’s house multiple times, and she had told them her boyfriend was not there.

Write an article with the title: \\"Tip Bankers Like Waiters\\"","completion":"Title: Tip Bankers Like Waiters Introduction: In the service industry, tipping is a long-standing tradition. When we go out to eat at a restaurant, we know that leaving a tip for our waiter or waitress is expected. Tipping is a way to show appreciation for excellent service, and it is an essential part of the income of service staff. However, the concept of tipping isn't typically associated with the banking industry. In this article, we will explore the idea of tipping bankers and discuss the potential benefits of adopting a similar system. Step 1: Explain the current status of the banking industry The banking industry is an important sector in the economy, responsible for managing our financial transactions, securing loans, and providing financial advice. While bankers are often compensated with a salary and performance-based bonuses, they do not generally receive tips for their services. Many people may not even consider tipping their banker, assuming that their salary and benefits are sufficient. Step 2: Explore the similarities between waiters and bankers Though the nature of their jobs is different, there are similarities between the roles of waiters and bankers. Both are service-oriented professions, necessitating strong interpersonal skills and customer service expertise. Both waiters and bankers also work to address the needs of their customers, whether it's providing information about a savings account or ensuring your satisfaction during a meal. Step 3: Discuss the potential benefits of tipping bankers Introducing a tipping system for bankers could have several positive effects on the banking industry. Firstly, it could incentivize bankers to provide even better customer service, as they would be motivated to receive tips from clients for their exceptional services. As a result, overall customer satisfaction could increase. Secondly, by giving customers the option to tip their bankers, it could foster a more personal relationship between the two parties. A positive banking experience could lead to increased trust and loyalty between the client and the banker. Consequently, clients may be more likely to recommend the bank to others, promoting the bank's growth and success. Step 4: Address potential drawbacks While tipping bankers may have its benefits, there are potential drawbacks as well. For instance, introducing tips could put pressure on bankers to focus on customer-facing roles, potentially neglecting important backend work, or causing undue stress. Additionally, employees might become reliant on tips, which could contribute to income disparity within banks. Step 5: Explore how a tipping system could be implemented If the idea of tipping bankers is to gain traction, a feasible implementation plan would be necessary. One potential strategy would be to introduce optional tip jars at teller windows or discreet prompts on digital banking platforms, allowing customers to tip at their discretion. Additionally, banks could provide guidelines on recommended tip amounts or percentages based on the services provided. Conclusion: Though the concept of tipping bankers is unconventional, it opens an interesting dialogue on recognizing and rewarding exceptional service in the banking industry. By exploring this idea, we can encourage discussions around customer satisfaction and, ultimately, strive for better service standards across all industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Cos she's real slutty.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In order to translate the phrase \\"Cos she's real slutty.\\" to Czech, we will perform the following steps: 1. Identify the words and phrases in the sentence that need to be translated. 2. Translate each word or phrase individually. 3. Combine the translated words and phrases to form a coherent sentence in Czech. Step 1: Identify the words and phrases in the sentence that need to be translated - Cos she's = because she is - real = opravdu (in this context, meaning truly or really) - slutty = at first glance, the word might seem offensive. However, a non-offensive direct translation would be \\"lechtivá\\" or \\"lejchtavá,\\" which means flirtatious, or promiscuous. Step 2: Translate each word or phrase individually - Because she is = protože ona je - real = opravdu - slutty = lechtivá Step 3: Combine the translated words and phrases to form a coherent sentence in Czech - \\"protože ona je opravdu lechtivá.\\" So, the phrase \\"Cos she's real slutty.\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"protože ona je opravdu lechtivá.\\" Keep in mind that depending on context and intention, there could be other more or less appropriate translations of the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Diet book fraudster Kevin Trudeau trying to hide fortune Published: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:42 PM Updated: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:49 PM Looks like this scam won't work, either. Former TV pitchman Kevin Trudeau, who is already serving a decade-long prison sentence in Alabama for criminal contempt, is allegedly trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the government — just two years after claiming he was sent to prison “penniless.” The deceitful diet book author earned at least 24 million over the last decade, and his crock companies may have taken in more than half a billion dollars during that same time, with 30 million of that still unaccounted for, ABC Chicago reported. The government believes Trudeau is trying to hide his fortune in Swiss and Caribbean banks in anticipation of his release. “Mr. Trudeau continues to resist, but we will do everything we can to find the money that properly belongs to (his) consumers,” Federal Trade Commission attorney Jonathan Cohen said Tuesday. The FTC is planning to send refund checks of 11 to nearly all of the 820,000 people who bought Trudeau’s 2007 book “The Weight-Loss Cure ‘They’ Don't Want You to Know About.” That book brought fraud fines and eventual convictions to Trudeau a year after its publication due to its unsafe, unproven and unsubstantiated health advice. For example, the book told readers to suffice on a 500-calorie-a-day diet and get prescription injections of a hormone only found in pregnant women. Five iconic pitchmen who landed in hot water after becoming ‘as seen on TV’ famous Trudeau, 52, told a court under oath in 2013 he was completely broke, even though he continued to dish on fancy dinners and jet around the world, the Chicago Tribune reported. \\"He told me he was broke when he had hundreds of millions of dollars going through his hands,\\" U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman Judge Gettleman said Tuesday. “When he gets out, we're going to be going right back into this.” The slippery salesman’s lawyer could face punishment of his own for allegedly helping his client on the money scam.","completion":"Former TV pitchman and diet book author Kevin Trudeau is allegedly attempting to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the US government while serving a decade-long prison sentence for criminal contempt.

During the Vietnam War , the 104th field battery also served with the 12th field regiment , which was also assigned to the 161th field battery RNZA .","completion":"These two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, but they are closely related. The differences lie in the specific units stated and the organizational structure mentioned. Let's break down both sentences to highlight the similarities and differences. Sentence 1: \\"During the Vietnam War, the 12th Field Battery also served with the 104th Field Regiment -- to which the 161st Field Battery RNZA was also attached.\\" In this sentence, we understand that: - The 12th Field Battery served alongside the 104th Field Regiment during the Vietnam War. - The 161st Field Battery RNZA was also attached to the 104th Field Regiment. Sentence 2: \\"During the Vietnam War, the 104th field battery also served with the 12th field regiment, which was also assigned to the 161th field battery RNZA.\\" In this sentence, we understand that: - The 104th Field Battery served alongside the 12th Field Regiment during the Vietnam War. - The 12th Field Regiment was also assigned to the 161st Field Battery RNZA. The key differences between the two sentences are: - Sentence 1 refers to the 12th Field Battery serving with the 104th Field Regiment, while Sentence 2 refers to the 104th Field Battery serving with the 12th Field Regiment. This difference in unit names (battery vs. regiment) creates confusion in understanding the actual organizational structure. - Sentence 1 specifies that the 161st Field Battery RNZA was attached to the 104th Field Regiment, while Sentence 2 indicates that the 12th Field Regiment was assigned to the 161st Field Battery RNZA. This again changes the perceived hierarchy and relationship between these units. To summarize, while both sentences discuss the involvement of the 12th Field Battery, 104th Field Regiment, and 161st Field Battery RNZA during the Vietnam War, the actual relationships and hierarchy between these units differ in each sentence. They do not mean the same, but they convey related information about the organizational structure and interactions during the war."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Remarkable Life of Second Lieutenant Walter Tull: Remembering a War Hero and Footballer Introduction: Walter Tull (1888 - 1918) was a trailblazer, both on and off the football field. As a professional football player who later became a Second Lieutenant in the British Army during World War I, Tull broke racial barriers and set new precedents. Despite his numerous accomplishments, letters uncovered reveal that Tull was recommended for a gallantry medal but was denied due to racial discrimination. This article will delve into the life of Walter Tull, his accomplishments, and the injustice that prevailed. Step 1: Walter Tull's Early Life and Football Career: Walter Tull was born on April 28, 1888, in Folkestone, England. He faced adversity from a young age, losing both of his parents and growing up in an orphanage. Despite his troubling past, Tull found solace in sports, particularly football. He pursued a career in football, eventually signing with Tottenham Hotspur, a prestigious professional football club. At Tottenham, Tull was one of the very first mixed-race players in England's top league, making a significant mark in football history. Step 2: Military Service and Promotions: When the First World War broke out in 1914, Tull enlisted and eventually became a Second Lieutenant, defying the racial barriers of the time. He fearlessly fought for his country, with his extraordinary bravery and leadership abilities earning him the respect of his fellow soldiers. He actively participated in battles such as the Battle of the Somme and the Italian front, where he stood tall in the face of adversity. Step 3: Death and Attempts to Honour Tull: Tragically, Walter Tull was killed in action on March 25, 1918, aged just 29. Letters to his family uncovered that Tull had been recommended for a gallantry medal, specifically the Military Cross. However, due to the racial discrimination and the institutional barriers of the time, it is believed that Tull was denied the honour that he rightly deserved. Step 4: Legacy and Modern Recognition: Walter Tull may not have received the recognition he deserved during his time, but the world has taken steps to rectify this and honour Tull's memory. As a talented footballer and a courageous solider, Tull's legacy resonates within both the sports and military communities. His story serves as a testimony to the resilience and courage required to fight for justice and equality in challenging times. Conclusion: Second Lieutenant Walter Tull's life, though cut tragically short, serves as a shining example of courage, determination, and the power of challenging racial barriers. Today, his story continues to inspire generations to fight against discrimination and strive for equality. By remembering and honouring Tull, the hope is to create a better and just future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When Italian designer Arturo Vittori and Swiss architect Andreas Vogler first visited Ethiopia in 2012,they were shocked to see women and children forced to walk miles to access what,for them,had always been within easy reach,water. Only 34 percent of Ethiopians have access to a reliable water supply.Some travel for up to six hours a day to fetch some or,even worse,have to use pond water polluted by human waste, _ the spread of disease. Worldwide,about 768 million people--two and a half times the U.S.population--don't have access to safe drinking water.So just imagine if we could just pull water out of thin air?That's what Vittori and Vogler asked once they saw the severe problem and promised to take action.Their firm,Architecture and Vision,has since come up with Warka Water,a grand palm-like structure that may look like something you'd see in a modern art museum,but it's been designed to harvest water from the air. Warka Water,which is named after an Ethiopian fig tree,is composed of a 30-foot bamboo frame containing a fog-harvesting nylon net that can catch water easily,can be easily lowered for repairs and allow communities to measure the water level.Collecting water through condensation is hardly a new technique,but the creators of Warka Water say their tree-inspired design is more effective,maximizing surface and perfecting every angle to produce up to 26 gallons of drinkable water a day--enough for a family of seven. Western organizations have been working to provide clean water access in Africa for decades,so Warka Water joins a very long list of earlier attempts.So far,high-tech solutions,like the once promising Playpump,have failed,mostly due to high costs and maintenance issues. This is where Warka Water stands apart--a lower-tech solution that is easy to repair and far more affordable than digging wells in the rocky Ethiopian plateau.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Definition: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage. Your job is to determine whether information from more than one term is needed to answer the question. Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Input: Question: What country was Wang Han born in? Passage:A native of Hsinchu County, Wang was born in 1954. He began swimming in the Touqian River at a young age, and in college, started swimming the ocean. Wang's first publicized attempt at long-distance swimming in 1985 was funded by the actors' guild of which Wang held membership. He swam from Donggang, Pingtung, to Liuqiu Island in approximately six hours. Subsequently, aged 31, he chose to retire from acting and modeling to concentrate on swimming. In August 1986, Wang swam the Strait of Gibraltar. From 1988 to 1998, Wang traversed one body of water per year, including the English Channel (1988), Bosporus (1989), the channels of the Hawaiian Islands around Maui (1990), the Strait of Juan de Fuca (1993), the Tsugaru Strait (1994), Cleveland Bay (1996), and the Strait of Sicily (1998). He had originally planned to swim the Taiwan Strait in 1998, but did not do so, as it was too soon after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. Wang was consulted about plans to swim the Taiwan Strait in 2001, and scheduled his own attempt throughout 2007, after receiving help from Chi Cheng. The 2007 attempt was unsuccessful, and Wang made plans for the strait in January 2008, though this last attempt received no further media coverage. Output:","completion":"b Justification: To answer the question \\"What country was Wang Han born in?\\", only the term \\"Hsinchu County\\" is needed because the phrase \\"a native of Hsinchu County\\" indicates Wang Han's birthplace. Though there are many other proper nouns in the passage, they are not necessary for this particular answer. Hsinchu County is located in Taiwan, thereby giving us the answer that Wang Han was born in Taiwan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The 71-year-old ex-police officer accused of shooting dead a man inside a Florida movie theater won't get the chance to go home -- at least for now -- after a judge Friday decided not to grant him bail. Judge Pat Siracusa made his decision after two days of wrenching, evocative, at times seemingly contradictory testimony inside a Dade City, Florida, courtroom. \\"The state did, in fact, meet their standard,\\" Siracusa said of prosecutors argument that Curtis Reeves shouldn't be allowed to post bond. \\"And I am going to detain Mr. Reeves, pretrial. He will remain in custody.\\" Reeves' lawyer signaled his intention to appeal a decision that -- while not unexpected, given this is a homicide case -- he believes is unwarranted. The attorney, Richard Escobar, said that he's optimistic about not only the appeal on bail, but that a jury of six citizens will side with his client. \\"Mr. Reeves is truly an innocent man,\\" Escobar told reporters. \\"And we look forward to proving that at a jury trial at some point.\\" The widow of the man that Reeves killed, meanwhile, applauded Siracusa's decision. \\"I'm just very happy and relieved,\\" Nicole Oulson said. \\"... I have no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision.\\" No threats before shooting, widow says Was it self-defense or an overreaction?

Summarize this article: On the second day of the trial in Cape Town, Mziwamadoda Qwabe said he was asked to make it look like a hijacking. Mr Dewani, 34, from Bristol, denies murdering his wife Anni, 28, on their honeymoon in 2010. The couple were held at gunpoint while being driven in a taxi through Gugulethu township near Cape Town. Qwabe told the Western Cape High Court that taxi driver Zola Tonga had told him \\"there was a husband who wanted his wife to be killed\\". Mr Dewani faces five charges, including murder and lying about the circumstances of Swedish national Anni's death. Qwabe, from Cape Town, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2012 for the murder of Anni Dewani. Prosecutors claim Mr Dewani conspired with him, and other Cape Town residents Zola Tongo and Xolile Mngeni. Qwabe, 29, told the court Tongo phoned him and said he had a job that needed to be done - that someone needed to be killed. He said Tongo agreed to meet him the next day to discuss the murder, and a price of 15,000 rand (about £1,330 at the exchange rate at the time) was agreed. The pair then arranged to meet up with Tongo's taxi for the attack, during which Mr Dewani's phone would also be taken. He told the court the money was due to be left in a \\"cubby hole\\" in the vehicle which would later be split before the pair spent an evening \\"socialising\\". Qwabe was asked if there was any discussion about a weapon. He said: \\"I knew there would be a firearm involved.\\" He told the court Tongo called him later and told him the route the taxi would take on the evening of 13 November 2010. Describing the carjacking, Qwabe said: \\"[Mngeni] had the gun. As it [Tongo's car] approached I got into the driver's side. \\"[Mngeni] got into the passenger side and Zola got into the back. I saw in the (rear view) window a guy and behind me was a lady,\\" he said. \\"I ordered Zola to get out of the car. He told me the money was in a pouch behind the front passenger door. \\"I stopped the vehicle, I asked the husband to get out of the car. \\"The husband was now out of the vehicle and I drove on.\\" Qwabe told the court he was behind the wheel when Anni was fatally wounded. He said he was concentrating on the road at the moment Mngeni killed her. \\"I heard a gun shot. [Mngeni] said 'I shot the lady'. \\"I pulled over on to the pavement and stopped the car. I saw she [Anni] was on the back seat of the car.\\" Qwabe said he found the bullet casing then threw his gloves away. He told the court 10,000 rand was in the pouch and 4,000 rand was seized from \\"the husband\\". Qwabe admitted he had lied in court at a bail hearing before he admitted his guilt over the murder. Francois van Zyl, representing Dewani, said: \\"At that bail hearing you testified under oath, you pleaded not guilty because you said you had an alibi. Is that a lie?\\" Qwabe replied: \\"My lawyer at the time told me to plead not guilty.\\" Mr van Zyl said: \\"I repeat the question. Was that a lie under oath?\\" Qwabe answered: \\"Yes.\\" The court was told there had been no conversations with Tongo about how Anni would be killed, only that it had to look like a hijacking. Mr van Zyl asked: \\"You never had a discussion about how this woman was going to be killed?\\" Qwabe answered: \\"No, sir.\\" He told the court it was not decided who would strike the fatal blow, what weapon would be used, or where the killing would take place. On Monday Mr Dewani told the court in a written statement that his \\"whole world came crashing down\\" when his wife was found killed. He also revealed to the court that he is bisexual. A record of agreed facts in the case, released by the court on Wednesday, showed he had been browsing same-sex dating websites during the honeymoon and within days of his wife's death. It shows he was logged into the Gaydar website while waiting with his wife for a connecting flight to Cape Town, and three times between November 15 and November 16, He also logged into the Recon website twice. The trial was adjourned until Thursday. Summary:","completion":"A man named Mr. Dewani is being accused of planning to kill his wife Anni during their honeymoon in 2010.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Dennis had a much higher testosterone level than Christopher, so","completion":"Dennis had a much higher testosterone level than Christopher, so he visibly displayed a variety of physical and psychological differences that profoundly impacted their contrasting experiences in numerous aspects of their lives. These disparities became particularly apparent in their competitive attitudes, physical stature, energy levels, and social interactions. Firstly, Dennis's elevated testosterone level led to a heightened sense of competitiveness in various areas, including sports, academics, and career advancement. As a result, he often found himself striving to excel and seeking challenges to prove his abilities. On the other hand, Christopher displayed a more laid-back attitude, as he was less driven by the need for dominance and achievement. He typically opted for collaboration instead of competition, which in some cases, worked to his advantage as this allowed him to build strong relationships and connections. Secondly, the increased testosterone in Dennis's system contributed to a more muscular and defined body composition, providing him with greater strength, power, and agility. This advantage translated into an increased performance in physically demanding activities such as athletics and manual labor. Meanwhile, Christopher had a comparatively less muscular build with less overall physical strength, which made him gravitate more towards activities that relied more on mental aptitude and finesse rather than brute force. In terms of energy levels, Dennis often displayed a higher degree of vigor and vitality, thanks to his elevated testosterone levels. This enabled him to maintain alertness and performance throughout the day, allowing him to tackle tasks more efficiently. Conversely, Christopher might have experienced lower energy levels and a greater tendency to fatigue. Although this sometimes impacted his productivity, it encouraged him to find balance and prioritize relaxation and self-care. Socially, Dennis's high testosterone levels appeared to be both a boon and a bane. On one hand, it gave him the confidence to approach new situations with gusto, attracting people with his assertiveness and charm. Conversely, it sometimes led to aggressive or dominating behavior, which could be off-putting to some individuals. On the other side of the spectrum, Christopher's comparatively lower testosterone levels fostered a more amiable and empathetic demeanor, which many found to be approachable and comforting. However, it could also result in a perceived lack of self-assuredness and leadership qualities in certain situations. Ultimately, the hormonal variances between Dennis and Christopher shaped their experiences, choices, and perspectives. Dennis's higher testosterone levels manifested in increased competitiveness, a physically more imposing presence, greater energy, and a strong, occasionally overbearing, social demeanor. In contrast, Christopher exhibited a calmer disposition, more collaborative attitude, and a generally less physically aggressive presence, although occasionally at the expense of self-confidence and assertiveness. As is evident, these two distinct hormonal profiles produced contrasting life experiences and points of view for both individuals, offering them unique strengths and challenges as they navigated their journeys."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: She has been seen out and about for the first time since fans began speculating about whether she is starting a family CHERYL fuelled those ongoing baby rumours today as she was spotted out and about for the first time since speculation began over whether she is expecting her first child. The pop star was spotted out in London and she made sure to cover her tummy with her coat. Cheryl looked glowing as she wrapped up warm and held her beige jacket across her middle. Cheryl has been hit with pregnancy rumours in recent weeks as fans have been speculating that she is expecting a baby with her boyfriend Liam Payne. The former Girls Aloud star has stayed silent amid the furore, and her outing today has done little to dispel the gossip. It marks the first time Cheryl has been spotted out and about since she was hit by the rumours, and she kept her tummy firmly under wraps. Cheryl, 33, has been dating One Direction star Liam, 23, since earlier this year. They went public with their romance in May and appeared together at events over the summer, but they have both been keeping a low profile since September. It was that month the star first faced speculation about whether she is starting a family as fans noticed she was sporting a slightly fuller-looking face in a L’Oreal advert. The commercial caused a Twitter storm, and rumours about a possible pregnancy have continued ever since. Cheryl's mum fuelled the gossip when she was spotted buying pregnancy goods in Mothercare last month. The pictures, which showed Joan Callaghan buying a maternity pillow at a store in Newcastle sent fans into a frenzy. An eyewitness who was also in the queue told The Sun Online: “She had a massive pregnancy pillow which helps make your bump more comfortable when you’re trying to sleep. \\"She was asking the assistant for advice about another kind that she wanted, more of a wedge which you can put under your bump when it’s quite big to help take the weight. \\"The shop assistant went away and came back with what she had asked for.\\" Many fans claimed the snaps substantiated the gossip about Cheryl and Liam starting a family. The news comes as Cheryl faces a delay in taking her romance with Liam to the next level as her divorce from Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini has stalled. Reports suggest the Frenchman has put a halt to the divorce proceedings amid concerns about a clause in the settlement which would prevent him from talking about the couple's union. A source told The Mirror he's been saying Cheryl is trying to \\"gag\\" him and that he felt she wasn't there for him when his father died last year. One friend said: “JB has moved on. It’s been a really tough year for him with his father dying, leaving him the only remaining member of his family. \\"Then there is getting divorced and being bound by a ­confidentiality agreement – which means he can never defend himself or clarify any false reports. Cheryl and JB, 35, wed in 2014 after a three-month romance, but the ex-Girls Aloud singer confirmed their split early this year.","completion":"\\"Cheryl's Big Mystery: Is She Having a Baby with Liam?\\" This story talks about Cheryl, a famous singer, who people think might be having a baby with her boyfriend Liam.

Pick your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"[a]. no; These two sentences do not mean the same thing. The differences in these sentences lie in the country and time period of Vladimír Železný's affiliation. In sentence (1), it says that Vladimír Železný is a media businessman and politician in the Soviet Union, implying that he was active during the Soviet era. It's important to note that the Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), existed from 1922 to 1991. The Czech Republic, as a separate sovereign state, was established on January 1, 1993, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the first sentence is suggesting that Vladimír Železný was active in a time and place that precedes the existence of the Czech Republic. In sentence (2), it mentions that Vladimír Železný is a media businessman and politician in the Czech Republic. Here, the indication is that he is currently active or was active in the Czech Republic as a media businessman and politician after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Czech Republic as an independent country. In summary, both sentences have differing implications about the political and historical context of Vladimír Železný's career. In the first sentence, he is affiliated with the Soviet Union, while in the second sentence, he is affiliated with the Czech Republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it largely depends on the context and the intended audience. Here's a detailed analysis of the possible sentiments: 1. Humor: When someone refers to a 1.8 million property as a \\"little charmer,\\" it could be an attempt to make light of the situation or provide a sense of amusement. Generally speaking, a 1.8 million property would not be considered \\"little\\" in terms of price or value, so it's possible that the speaker is delivering this line with a comedic or ironic tone to highlight the contrast and make others laugh. 2. Sarcasm: Another possible sentiment is sarcasm, with the speaker using the term \\"little charmer\\" to sarcastically emphasize the high price of the property. By calling it \\"little,\\" the speaker may be trying to imply that the property is not worth the price or they find it surprising that something so small or modest could have such a high price tag. 3. Understatement: The sentence could also convey a sense of understatement. By referring to a 1.8million property as \\"little,\\" the speaker might be subtly implying that the property's value is greater than its price tag suggests or that they believe it's quite a bargain. This would mean that the speaker sees potential in the property and thinks it's a good investment despite the seemingly high price. 4. Appreciation: Lastly, the sentiment of the sentence could be perceived as genuine appreciation and admiration for the property at hand. The speaker might genuinely find it charming, regardless of its price, and the presence of the term \\"little\\" may simply be intended as an affectionate or endearing way to describe the property. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence, \\"this little 1.8 million charmer,\\" depends heavily on the context it's spoken or written in and the intent of the speaker or writer. It could be perceived as humor, sarcasm, understatement, or appreciation, with each interpretation being plausible given the right circumstances. To determine the exact sentiment, one would need more information about the situation or a deeper understanding of the speaker's opinions and feelings toward the property."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I have a new situation: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. But I can use this background: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. What is an answer for this question: Citizens of which city should be less concerned about sink holes? The answer is:","completion":"Citizens of Tichago should be less concerned about sink holes. Step 1: Identify the issue The issue mentioned in the question is soil piping, which can cause sink holes. Step 2: Analyze the situation of both cities - Reslie: Known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. - Currently experiencing soil piping. - Tichago: Neighboring city to Reslie. - Consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. - Not experiencing soil piping, according to the mayor. Step 3: Evaluate sink hole risks Since soil piping is a cause of sink holes and Reslie is experiencing soil piping, the risk of sink holes is higher in Reslie. On the other hand, Tichago is not experiencing soil piping, thus the risk of sink holes is lower in Tichago. Step 4: Choose the city with lower sink hole concern Based on the evaluation, Tichago has a lower risk of sink holes due to the absence of soil piping, so citizens of Tichago should be less concerned about sink holes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - The raccoon (or , \\"Procyon lotor\\"), sometimes spelled racoon, also known as the common raccoon, North American raccoon, northern raccoon and colloquially as coon, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of and a body weight of . Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythology of several Native American ethnic groups. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years.

In Italy, the term simply denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin. In English-speaking countries, however, the term \\"giallo\\" is used to refer to a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery film which often includes elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre). The genre began in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades (although some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision.

Almost 40 years after its release, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums in history. He is also known for his powerful wide-ranging operatic voice and theatrical live performances. - Dario Argento (born 7 September 1940) is an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter. He is best known for his work in the horror film genre, particularly in the subgenre known as giallo, and for his influence on modern horror movies. - Fur is used in reference to the hair of animals, usually mammals, particularly those with extensive body hair coverage that is generally soft and thick, as opposed to the stiffer bristles on most pigs. The term \\"pelage\\" first known use in English c. 1828(French, from Middle French, from \\"poil\\" hair, from Old French \\"peilss\\", from Latin \\"pilus\\",) is sometimes used to refer to the body hair of an animal as a complete coat. \\"Fur\\" is also used to refer to animal pelts which have been processed into leather with the hair still attached. The words \\"fur\\" or \\"furry\\" are also used, more casually, to refer to hair-like growths or formations, particularly when the subject being referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft \\"hairs.\\" If layered, rather than grown as a single coat, it may consist of short down hairs, long guard hairs, and, in some cases, medium awn hairs. Mammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called \\"naked\\", as with the naked mole-rat, or \\"hairless\\", as with hairless dogs. - Pelts is the sixth episode of the second season of Masters of Horror , first aired 1 December 2006 .

Here's a more detailed and long explanation about the translation: In the given sentence, \\"This finally took place on 16 November.\\" has been translated to German as \\"Diese Veranstaltung fand schließlich am 16. November statt.\\" Let's break down the translation by words and phrases: 1. \\"This\\" - The corresponding German word for \\"this\\" is \\"diese\\" when referring to a feminine or plural noun. In this context, we can assume the event being mentioned is feminine or plural in nature, hence the appropriate use of \\"diese\\". 2. \\"finally\\" - In German, \\"finally\\" can be translated as \\"schließlich\\" or \\"endlich\\". In this context, \\"schließlich\\" is the more suitable choice, as it implies that something has happened after waiting or overcoming difficulties. 3. \\"took place\\" - The verb phrase \\"took place\\" is translated to \\"fand statt\\" in German. It is the past tense form of \\"stattfinden\\", which means \\"to take place\\" or \\"occur\\". 4. \\"on\\" - In German, \\"on\\" can be translated as \\"am\\" when talking about dates or specific days. In this case, \\"am\\" is used to connect the 16th of November to the sentence. 5. \\"16 November\\" - In German, dates are written in a slightly different format compared to English. Instead of writing \\"November 16,\\" it is written as \\"16. November\\", with a period and the month following the day of the month. 6. To sum it up, the translated sentence in German is: \\"Diese Veranstaltung fand schließlich am 16.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred...

Volkswagen is working with the United Automobile Workers at its Chattanooga, Tenn., assembly plant on how to unionize the plant and create a German-style works council there, the president of the labor union said on Friday. The company would be the first German automaker to have such a council at a United States plant. A works council is a group of employees, including both white- and blue-collar workers, that meets with management on issues like working conditions and productivity. But to avoid violating American labor laws, the plant would first have to be formally unionized, the company said. âVW workers in Chattanooga have the unique opportunity to introduce this new model of labor relations to the United States, in partnership with the U.A.W.,â the unionâs president, Bob King, said in a statement on Friday. Volkswagen officials told employees at the Chattanooga plant on Thursday that it was negotiating with the union about establishing a works council there, where about 2,000 workers assemble the VW Passat. A letter, signed by the plantâs chairman, Frank Fischer, and its vice president for human resources, Sebastian Patta, said the talks were aimed at âthe possibility of implementing an innovative model of employee representation for all employees.â The VW officials said that a works council could be created at a company in the United States only with the cooperation of a labor union because it might otherwise be viewed as an illegal company-sponsored union. That, the VW officials wrote, is why the company has started its dialogue with the U.A.W. None of the foreign carmakers with auto plants in the South are currently unionized. Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee has been outspoken in opposing any union inroads at the Volkswagen plant, warning that it would undermine his stateâs efforts to attract investment. Volkswagen and U.A.W. officials met on Aug. 30 in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the company is based, to continue previous discussions about the works council and unionizing at the Chattanooga plant, which has been operating since 2011 and has a total of 2,500 employees including managers. Some labor and auto experts say that if the VW plant in Chattanooga gets a works council, it would create pressure to do likewise at the BMW plant in Spartanburg, S.C., and the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala. While some executives see works councils as a pesky thorn in their side, others see them as a useful source of ideas from the shop floor and a vehicle to build consensus and employee morale. âVolkswagen is a company that has extensive experience with union representation,â Mr. King said in his statement, âand the U.A.W. believes the role of the union in the 21st century is to create an environment where both the company and workers succeed.â U.A.W. officials say that Volkswagen has agreed to not oppose any unionization drive in Chattanooga. In the letter to Chattanooga employees, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Patta wrote that they wanted to âprevent any influence from outside driving a wedge into our great team.â That resembles language that anti-union companies often use to suggest that unions would be an undesirable third party that gets between employees and managers. But a U.A.W. official said that sentence referred to anti-union groups, like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and its Center for Economic Freedom, that have vigorously criticized Volkswagen for not battling to keep out a union the way that many American companies do.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Select from the following. (1). prairie (2). desert (3). coniferous forest (4). deciduous forest","completion":"The correct answer to the question is (2). desert. A short plant with a thick, fleshy stem, extensive roots, and a short blooming period is most likely to be found in a desert environment. Let us delve deeper into the properties of desert plants and why these characteristics are advantageous in this environment. Deserts are characterized by arid conditions, low humidity, and sparse precipitation. Consequently, plants that thrive in these conditions have evolved specific characteristics, such as thick stems, extensive roots, and short blooming periods, to cope with these harsh environmental stresses. The desert environment poses unique challenges to plant life, with adaptations essential for survival. The thick and fleshy stem seen in desert plants is an adaptation for storing water. When precipitation occurs, the short-lived influx of water is absorbed by these plants, allowing them to preserve valuable water resources for periods of drought. A well-known example of such a plant is the cactus, which is specifically adapted to survive in dry desert environments. Its thick stem serves as a water reservoir, allowing it to survive through long periods without rainfall. A desert plant's extensive root system is another vital adaptation for surviving in arid environments. With a large, expansive network of roots, desert plants can maximize their reach and access precious water resources found deep underground or spread over large areas close to the surface. The shallow roots help collect rainwater when it's available, while the deep roots tap into subsurface water. The extensive roots also provide stability to the plants, allowing them to withstand strong winds and shifting sands. The short blooming period observed in desert plants is a reproductive adaptation. A short blooming period ensures that the plant quickly uses the opportunity provided by the limited rain; it will bloom and set seeds before water becomes unavailable. Since the desert climate is less conducive to pollination over extended periods due to high temperatures, dry conditions, and wind, a short blooming condition can increase pollination success rates. This increases the odds of passing on their genetic material to the next generation. Comparing this to the other environments: (1). Prairie: Prairie plants are adapted to windy grasslands and require extensive root systems to anchor them in place. However, they tend to have a long blooming period compared to desert plants and generally do not have thick, fleshy stems for water storage. (3). Coniferous forest: Plants in coniferous forests are adapted to cold, dark environments and generally do not need to store water or have extensive root systems like desert plants. They have other adaptations, such as evergreen leaves and waxy coatings to help them withstand cold temperatures. (4). Deciduous forest: In deciduous forests, plants like short-lived wildflowers will have short blooming periods. However, the flora here is more focused on adapting to seasonal changes such as leaf shedding rather than water conservation adaptations. In conclusion, based on the characteristics provided—a short plant with a thick, fleshy stem, extensive roots, and a short blooming period—the most likely environment for this type of plant is the desert (option 2). The adaptations presented primarily allow for efficient water storage, access to scarce water through extensive roots system, and successful reproduction during the brief rainy season in harsh desert conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about Florida.","completion":"What role has Florida played in the development and growth of the U.S. space program? Florida has played a crucial role in the development and growth of the United States space program. The state's first involvement with the space program started during the early stages of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Since then, Florida has continued to contribute and expand its involvement in the world of space exploration. One of the main reasons Florida has been such an essential player in the U.S. space program is because of its ideal geographic location. The state's proximity to the equator allows rockets to benefit from the Earth's rotational speed, making it easier and more fuel-efficient to reach the desired orbits. Florida's coastline facing the Atlantic Ocean also provides a safe and unobstructed launch path for space missions. Cape Canaveral in Florida has been a key location for the U.S. space program. The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was established in 1948 as a missile test facility. By 1958, the first United States satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into space from this location. Since then, numerous space missions and projects have been developed and executed from Cape Canaveral and the surrounding areas. The John F. Kennedy Space Center, also located on Florida's east coast, is arguably one of the most iconic elements of the U.S. space program. Established in 1962 as the nation's primary launch center for human spaceflight, the Kennedy Space Center has played host to some of the most iconic space missions in history. This includes the legendary Apollo 11 mission which successfully landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969. Florida's Space Coast, where both Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center are located, has seen the launch of numerous iconic spacecraft such as the Saturn V rockets for the Apollo missions and the Space Shuttle program that operated from 1981 until 2011. The Space Coast is still in use today for launches of private aerospace companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance. In addition to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida is also home to other organizations and aerospace companies that are involved in the space industry. For example, the Space Florida agency was established in 2006 to promote the growth of Florida's aerospace sector, attract investment, and facilitate business development. Florida's colleges and universities, such as the University of Florida and the Florida Institute of Technology, play a significant role in developing the next generation of engineers and scientists to support the growth and development of the U.S. space program. These institutions provide cutting-edge research and innovation in the fields of aerospace engineering, astronautics, and other space-related fields. In summary, Florida has been an integral part of the U.S. space program due to its prime geographic location, historic launch facilities, higher education institutions, and collaboration with private companies. The state's ongoing contributions to space exploration and development are a testament to Florida's role in shaping the future of human spaceflight and innovative aerospace industries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony has been suspended one game without pay for confronting Boston's Kevin Garnett in the arena tunnel, near the players' locker rooms, and in the parking garage following Monday's game against the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden. The NBA announced the suspension on Wednesday. Anthony served the suspension Thursday, when the Knicks lost 81-76 to the Indiana Pacers. \\"There are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for a player to confront an opponent after a game,\\" NBA executive vice president basketball operations Stu Jackson said in a statement. \\"Carmelo Anthony attempted to engage with Kevin Garnett multiple times after Monday's game and therefore a suspension was warranted.\\" Anthony said before the suspension was announced that he did not believe he deserved to be disciplined. \\"If you just go off the actual facts of what happened, I don't think anything will happen,\\" Anthony said. After he and Garnett were called for technical fouls for jawing at one another in the closing minutes of Monday's game, Anthony approached Garnett at the Celtics' team bus. Madison Square Garden security, New York City Police officers, team security and even Knicks coach Mike Woodson intervened before the incident could escalate. Anthony said Tuesday that his \\"motivation\\" in finding Garnett after the game was to have a \\"one-on-one conversation\\" with him after the Boston big man spewed a verbal insult at Anthony. \\"It's certain things that you just don't say to men, another man,\\" Anthony said Tuesday. \\"I felt that he crossed the line. Like I said, we're both at an understanding right now; we handled it the way we handled it. Nobody needs to know what was said behind closed doors. So that situation is handled.\\" Anthony's teammate, Tyson Chandler, was on the floor at the time and agreed that Garnett crossed the line. \\"I think it was a little too much, in all honesty,\\" Chandler said Wednesday in an appearance on \\"The Michael Kay Show\\" on ESPN New York 98.7 FM. \\"I felt like Melo wanted to have a conversation man to man (with Garnett), and I respect that.\\" According to a source close to Anthony, he and Garnett had a phone conversation after the confrontation to clear the air. The Knicks' star said Wednesday that he was ready to move on from the incident. \\"That's over with, don't even want to go back to that,\\" Anthony said after practice. \\"Whatever happened between me and Kevin, that's done.

It's unclear at this point who will start in place of Anthony against the Pacers, who have won eight of 10. Ian Begley is regular contributor to ESPNNewYork.com ||||| Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneurial icon Mark Cuban is in hot water with the NBA again, this time over some costly comments he made on Twitter. The league fined Cuban 50,000 on Tuesday for a tweet he posted after his Mavericks lost at home to the lowly New Orleans Hornets on Saturday. Here is the tweet in question: Im sorry NBA fans. Ive tried for 13 yrs to fix the officiating in this league and I have failed miserably. Any Suggestions ? I need help — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 6, 2013 The 50,000 fine comes out to just over 367 per character for the 136-character tweet, but that's just chump change to Cuban, whose net worth tops 2 billion. It's the rough equivalent of a 1 fine for someone earning 40,000 per year. Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 autobiography describing the early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice. Is this statement correct \\"is i know why the caged bird sings a poem\\"?","completion":"The statement is incorrect. \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" is not a poem, but rather an autobiography by American writer and poet Maya Angelou. However, the title of the autobiography was inspired by a line from the poem \\"Sympathy\\" by African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town. Follow the railroad and take the first trail south.\\" Question: The cowboy that range the spittoon was probably: Options: A. not enough information B. Known for being a rodeo star C.

However, there is not enough information provided to determine whether he is known for being a rodeo star, always getting into trouble, or always chewing tobacco. The only thing we can ascertain is that he was chewing tobacco at the time of the story.

Cinnaholic is a vegan bakery franchise that started in 2010 and currently operates in eight states. The company's owners appeared on the television show Shark Tank in 2014, which ended with them ultimately turning down a 200,000 investment offer from Robert Herjavec. The company has adopted a franchise business model and has plans to open 100 locations by 2020. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Cinnaholic operates in several states\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can establish the assertion that Cinnaholic is a multi-state operation. It is explicitly mentioned that the vegan bakery franchise \\"currently operates in eight states,\\" therefore classifying it as a multi-state business. The exact term \\"several\\" is typically used to denote more than two but not many, it can be reasonably asserted that eight can be considered \\"several.\\" Further, the additional information provided about the company's appearance on the television show Shark Tank in 2014 and their decision to turn down a 200,000 investment offer from Robert Herjavec lends some context to the company's status and performance. It indicates that the company has garnered enough attention and value to be presented on a high visibility platform like Shark Tank and that it holds enough confidence in its business model to decline substantial financial investment. In addition, we learn that the company is not just operating in several states, but it does so using a franchise business model. This model is typically used by businesses that intend to expand their reach and operations in a cost-effective way, hinting at their growth and expansion strategy. Finally, their aspiration to open 100 locations by 2020 gives another indication of their ambition and potential scope of operation, making it a highly possible assumption that they are not only present in several states at the time of the information presented, but also have plans for future expansion, both within the existing states and possibly into new ones. So, in conclusion, the statement \\"Cinnaholic operates in several states\\" is accurate and supported by the information given in the paragraph. It suggests a successful and ambitious business with a clear growth strategy and a substantial footprint in the U.S. market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can an eye damaged through fire works be repaired? Bain initial call, what does it entail? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"First, let's address the question about eye damage due to fireworks. Fireworks can cause varying degrees of eye injuries, such as corneal abrasions, superficial burns, retinal detachment, and even severe injuries due to chemical burns or impact from projectile objects. The reparability of an eye damaged by fireworks depends on the extent of the injury and the specific structures of the eye that are affected. It is important to seek immediate medical attention in any case of eye injury from fireworks. For minor injuries such as corneal abrasions or superficial burns, treatment may include antibiotic eye drops, lubricating eye drops, and pain management, allowing the eye to heal within a few days to weeks. However, more severe cases may require specialized medical intervention. In cases of retinal detachment, surgery is often necessary to reattach the retina and restore vision. There are various methods, such as scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy, or vitrectomy, depending on the extent of the detachment and the patient's specific circumstances. The prognosis for regaining vision depends on the extent of the detachment, the duration of the detachment, and the surgical intervention's success. In extremely severe cases, such as those involving chemical burns or significant physical injury, the eye may not be repairable, and the patient may experience permanent vision loss or need to undergo enucleation (removal of the eye). In these instances, eye prosthetics may be considered for cosmetic purposes. As for the second question, \\"Bain initial call, what does it entail?\\" it appears unrelated to the topic of eye damage caused by fireworks. The Bain initial call refers to the first phone call or communication a candidate has with a representative from Bain & Company, a global management consulting firm, during the recruitment process. During this call, the representative may discuss a candidate's background, qualifications, and interest in the company while also providing an overview of the firm's culture, values, and opportunities. The call serves as an initial screening to decide whether or not the candidate may be a suitable fit for the company and help the candidate decide if Bain & Company aligns with their career goals. In conclusion, these questions have different meanings. The first question relates to eye injury repair resulting from fireworks, while the second question relates to the recruitment process at a management consulting firm, Bain & Company. Each question covers separate topics and requires distinct information to address them effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Christgau called it \\"both a hymn for the Movement and a love song for his wife, celebrating a Yokoism and a Marcusianism simultaneously\\". Included in several song polls, in 1999, BMI named it one of the top 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. Also that year, it received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. \\"Imagine\\" ranked number 23 in the list of best-selling singles of all time in the UK, in 2000.

Really want to shoot bird that starts tweeting outside our bedroom at 5:30am every day. And now that I'm in VA I can actually shoot it Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet can be described as a combination of frustration, annoyance, and a desire for a practical, if extreme, solution to a recurring problem. The author appears to be significantly bothered by a bird that consistently begins tweeting outside their bedroom at 5:30 am every day, which disturbs their sleep and negatively affects their morning experience. The fact that this bird has managed to become such a nuisance suggests that the disturbance is significant enough to impact the author's mood and well-being. The tweet also implies a certain level of familiarity with and adaptability to the local culture and norms of Virginia (VA), likely meaning the author has recently moved there or is presently visiting. The mention of Virginia implies that the author is aware of local regulations and attitudes about firearms, suggesting that they may consider the state more accepting towards the use of guns for personal reasons in comparison to their previous location. The author's consideration of resorting to using a gun to literally shoot the problematic bird indicates that they may be feeling desperate for a solution to a seemingly small problem that has a considerable impact on their life. Moreover, the sentiment embodied in this tweet can be perceived as a desire for control over one's environment and personal space. By suggesting the option to shoot the bird, the author may be feeling empowered by the possibility to exercise control over the situation and prevent the irritating interruptions to their sleep. It conveys a sense of territoriality, where the author seeks to maintain a sense of peace and calm within their living space by addressing the disturbance caused by the bird. However, it's important to note that the sentiment could also be viewed as an exaggeration or an expression of exasperation. The author might not necessarily intend to go through with the action of shooting the bird, but instead uses the hyperbolic idea to emphasize the level of irritation and inconvenience the bird causes them. In conclusion, the sentiment embodied in this tweet is a blend of frustration, annoyance, a desire for control, adaptability to local norms, and potentially an element of exaggeration. The author's expression might serve as an indicator of their desperation to remedy a seemingly insignificant, yet highly infuriating situation that has a significant impact on their daily life and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A 31-year-old Chicago man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, allegedly strangling her to death during a late-night fight on Tuesday. Daniel Kralik is being held on a 1 million bond in the relation to the slaying of Victoria McManus, 26, who he had been dating for two years. The couple had been living together for the past two months at her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street, Assistant State’s Attorney Alexandra Molesky told The Chicago Sun-Times. Two weeks ago, the couple got into a fight because McManus, 26, had a relationship with another man, Molesky said. Confessed: Daniel Kralik called 911 and admitted that he had strangled Victoria McManus after an argument at the apartment they shared in Chicago on Tuesday night. Gone too soon: Victoria A. McManus was found dead in her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street in Chicago on Tuesday night. Kralik initially planned to move out and stay with friends, but the couple reconciled and continued living together. On Tuesday, the couple got into another fight at McManus’ apartment, authorities said. McManus left her residence while Kralik went to a friend’s place until he 'cooled off', Molesky said. Instead, Kralik stayed at McManus’ apartment and when she returned home the couple got into another argument in her bedroom, Molesky said. During the argument, Kralik allegedly strangled McManus with his hands. The roommate heard the muffled sounds of an argument and a brief struggle, Molesky said. Kralik called 911 and admitted that he strangled McManus after an argument. Police responded about 12:50 a.m. and arrested Kralik, authorities said. McManus was declared dead at the scene. McManus is believed to have recently started a relationship with another man, infuriating her boyfriend, who has now been charged with her murder. McManus was found lying on her bed with an abrasion on her forehead and a pillow covering her face, Molesky said. An autopsy confirmed McManus died of strangulation, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Kralik appeared in court wearing Thursday a white plastic jumpsuit because his clothes were taken as evidence. Judge Adam Bourgeois ordered Kralik held on 1 million bond and issued a next court date of June 4. Kralik, whose parents live in Montana, had been working at an aquarium and fish store and has no criminal history, his public defender said. Police listed his address as the 2200 block of West Iowa Street. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: New sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits are rocking the already scandal riddled Fox News Channel. Three new lawsuits were filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Two allege racial harassment at Fox News, while a third alleges sexual harassment at Fox News Radio. The cases increase to 23 the number of past or present Fox employees represented by attorney Doug Wigdor, the majority having cases alleging racial hostility by a since-fired financial executive. Fox said Monday that the lawsuits have no legal basis. Kathleen Lee, a Fox News Radio employee of more than 10 years, alleges that radio anchor Ron Flatter subjected her to “unrelenting sexual harassment” after the network hired him in 2013. A former Fox employee, Adasa Blanco, said she alerted Fox executives about racially hostile behavior on the part of former Fox controller Judith Slater more than eight years before the executive was let go. Slater has denied charges of racially hostile conduct. Blanco, who is Hispanic, said that Slater made fun of her accent. In the lawsuit, Wigdor said Fox “knowingly harbored and protected” a racist employee for more than eight years and misrepresented to the public that it fired Slater quickly upon learning of her behavior. Naima Farrow, another former Fox employee who worked for Slater, said she was fired without warning or explanation in 2015, less than three days after telling superiors she was pregnant. Farrow, who is black, said Slater mockingly referred to her as “girlfriend.” Fox News said in a statement that it is committed to a diverse workplace free from discrimination, and takes any complaint seriously. In these cases, Fox “took prompt, effective and, when necessary, strong remedial action,” the network said. “We believe these latest claims are without legal basis and look forward to proving that the company at all times has acted appropriately, and lawfully, in connection with these matters.” The new legal claims come as Fox News is battling a series of...

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

People are sitting in the stands watching. the man","completion":"is wearing a sports uniform and holding a ball in his hand. The anticipation in the air is palpable as the spectators eagerly await the start of the game. Based on this scenario, the most logical next event is that the man in the sports uniform will initiate the game by performing an action relevant to the specific sport being played. The type of sport remains unspecified in the given information, so we will consider three popular sports events to provide a comprehensive answer. 1. Soccer (Football): If the man is dressed in soccer attire and is holding a soccer ball, the most logical next event would be the commencement of the match with the man either kicking off the soccer ball or passing it to a teammate. The kickoff signifies the start of the game, and the two teams on the field will then compete against each other to score goals and ultimately determine the winner of the match. 2. American Football: If the man is wearing an American football uniform and is holding a football, the next most logical event could be that the man is the quarterback about to start an offensive play. This could involve the quarterback initiating a snap by having the center pass the football between his legs, taking the football, and then deciding whether to pass the ball to a teammate, hand it off to a running back, or run with the ball himself in an attempt to progress down the field and eventually score a touchdown. 3. Baseball: If the man is dressed in a baseball uniform and is holding a baseball, it would be logical to assume that he is either a pitcher or a batter. If he is a pitcher, the next event would be him throwing the ball towards the home plate in an attempt to strike out the batter. If he is the batter, the next event would involve him stepping up to the home plate, taking a swing at the incoming pitch, and attempting to hit the ball to reach a base or send it out of the park for a home run. Regardless of the specific sport being played, the most logical next event for this man, who is wearing a sports uniform and holding a ball on the field, is to initiate the game by participating in a crucial starting play that sets the stage for the ensuing competition between the two teams. The spectators in the stands will continue to watch and cheer, further adding to the excitement and intensity of the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"The place where students run a number of news media outlets is a kind of?\\" Context: \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The place where students run a number of news media outlets can be referred to as a hub for student media or a student media center. At the University of Notre Dame, this vibrant and diverse student media ecosystem comprises various newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, and television stations, reflecting the interests and creativity of the student body. The student media hub at Notre Dame provides opportunities for students to engage in journalism, creative writing, and media production, allowing them to develop practical skills while contributing to the intellectual and cultural life of the university community. The nine student-run media outlets cater to a wide range of interests and offer an essential platform for free expression, open discourse, and the exchange of ideas within the university's academic environment. Among these outlets, the Scholastic magazine holds a special status as the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States, highlighting the long-standing tradition of student involvement in media at Notre Dame. The other magazine, The Juggler, is dedicated to showcasing student literature and artwork, emphasizing the importance of fostering artistic talent within the university community. The various newspapers, such as The Observer, Common Sense, and Irish Rover, reflect the diversity of opinions and concerns among students. These publications offer a platform for students to voice their thoughts and share valuable perspectives on university news, local and global events, and ideologically-driven issues. Through these newspapers, students are exposed to a wide array of viewpoints, which fosters critical thinking and promotes a healthy exchange of ideas. The Dome yearbook captures the memories, achievements, and milestones of each academic year, playing a significant role in preserving the university's history. Furthermore, the expansion of media channels, such as the radio and television station, underlines the commitment to embracing modern communication technologies and diversifying student media offerings. The emergence of newer publications like Beyond Politics, an undergraduate journal for political science research, highlights the importance of nurturing research interests among students and providing a platform for showcasing their work in a specialized journal. In conclusion, the place where students run a series of news media outlets at the University of Notre Dame can be described as a multifaceted student media hub that fosters creativity, provides valuable learning opportunities, and supports the expression of diverse ideas and perspectives within the university community. This vibrant and dynamic student media ecosystem significantly contributes to the intellectual and cultural richness of Notre Dame while serving as a model for other universities to follow and expand their own student-led media initiatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: Napoleon and Amber, both experts in their respective fields, are called upon by a shadowy government organization. Their objective is to team up and locate Missy, who has been kidnapped by a dangerous extremist group led by the notorious warlord, Letch. The duo, although initially wary of each other, quickly join forces and embark on their perilous mission. With the clock ticking and the risk of the weapon being unleashed on the world, they must put aside their reservations and work together to save Missy. Act 2: As they delve deeper into the dangerous underworld controlled by Letch, Napoleon and Amber uncover that someone within the very organization that is employing them has a hidden agenda. Staying ahead of danger at every turn, the team survives assassination attempts and relentless pursuit by Letch's henchmen. Amidst the deception, a complicated love-hate relationship develops between Napoleon and Amber, fueled by their combined determination and shared experiences in life-threatening situations.

Philanthropist Admits Stealing More Than 1 Million From Charity For most of his long and very public life as a philanthropist, William E. Rapfogel has been surrounded by powerful friends and politicians, chief among them Sheldon Silver, the New York State Assembly speaker. But as he sat in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday, about to plead guilty to a slew of criminal charges, Mr. Rapfogel was all alone. Grim-faced in a dark suit and black skullcap, Mr. Rapfogel quietly read passages from a well-thumbed copy of the Torah while his lawyers, Alan Vinegrad and Paul L. Shechtman, went over terms of a plea agreement. A few minutes later, Mr. Rapfogel, 59, stood before Justice Larry Stephen and admitted stealing more than 1 million from the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, the influential social service organization he had led for more than two decades. Mr. Rapfogel said he had overseen a scheme for 20 years, colluding with the owner of an insurance company and two other executives at the charity to overcharge the council for insurance policies and skim off cash. The state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said they had looted more than 9 million from the nonprofit. The plea marked a stunning downfall for a man once considered one of the New York City’s most respected philanthropists, whose work and close ties to Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, gave him influence and prominence in political circles. In the end, no one stood with Mr. Rapfogel as he pleaded guilty to grand larceny, money laundering, tax fraud and filing false documents to the city campaign finance board. His wife, Judy, the longtime chief of staff to Mr. Silver, was not there; neither was Mr. Silver, who over the years has allocated millions of public dollars to Met Council. Mr. Rapfogel will be sentenced to 31/3 to 10 years in prison and must pay 3 million in restitution to the charity; to date, he has repaid 1.8 million. If he fails to pay the full restitution by his sentencing date, July 16, he will be sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison, Gary T. Fishman, an assistant attorney general, said in court. Mr. Rapfogel, the former chief executive of the council, did not apologize publicly, and gave only a short explanation of what he had done, saying he had “knowingly helped steal more than 1 million from the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty as part of a scheme in which insurance premiums were overstated.” According to a plea agreement filed in court and an earlier criminal complaint, Mr. Rapfogel gave about 350,000 of the stolen funds to one of his three sons to buy a home. The agreement states the attorney general will not seek to recover that money from the son, who has not been identified, though Mr. Rapfogel has promised to pay it back. Neither Mr. Silver nor Ms. Rapfogel has been linked to the financial irregularities at the Met Council, and they have denied any knowledge of Mr. Rapfogel’s activities. The assembly speaker issued a terse statement about Mr. Rapfogel’s plea, saying simply: “I am deeply saddened by this entire episode.” Ms. Rapfogel declined to comment through a spokesman, Stu Loeser. An hour earlier, another defendant charged in the scheme, David Cohen, who was Mr. Rapfogel’s predecessor at the council, pleaded guilty to grand larceny and conspiracy before Justice Michael J. Obus. Mr. Cohen, 70, promised to pay back 650,000 that he said he had stolen from the charity starting in 1992, and he has already returned 500,000, prosecutors said. He will serve one year in prison under an agreement reached between his lawyer, Alan M. Abramson, and the attorney general’s office. Mr. Cohen, in his statement to the court, said he set up the scheme in 1992, conspiring with Herb Friedman, who was the chief financial officer, and Joseph Ross, the owner of Met Council’s insurance broker, Century Coverage Corporation. Mr. Ross, 58, admitted to his role in the fraud in December, pleading guilty to grand larceny, money laundering and tax fraud. Mr. Friedman was also arrested and will face conspiracy charges. At heart it was a simple scheme, Mr. Cohen said. The insurance company submitted inflated invoices to the council, which in turn paid the bills. Mr. Ross would then send the difference between the true cost of the insurance and the inflated amount to Mr. Cohen in cash. Mr. Cohen said in court that in the early years, the stolen money totaled about 20,000 to 30,000 a year. Six months after the scheme started, Mr. Rapfogel took over as the charity’s chief executive, and soon began getting a share of the money, Mr. Cohen said. In 1995, Mr. Rapfogel took over running the scheme; by 2013, Mr. Rapfogel was receiving 30,000 a month, Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Cohen, who is to be sentenced on July 9, said he and Mr. Rapfogel also funneled some of the illicit money to candidates running for office, asking Mr. Ross to make contributions not only in his name but also in the names of his employees and partners in the company. “These campaign contributions were made to politicians Willie and I thought would help Met Council — mainly, candidates for city elected offices,” Mr. Cohen told the judge. A criminal complaint filed against Mr. Ross said he had channeled at least 120,000 of the stolen funds to candidates for city office over the last 20 years. Met Council receives much of its funding through state and city grants and contracts, as well as from funds earmarked by individual lawmakers. Mr. Rapfogel’s scheme began to unravel last year after officials at Met Council received an anonymous letter detailing improprieties with insurance payments, and a law firm hired to investigate found evidence that the payments had been padded. Mr. Rapfogel, who received a 400,000 salary, was fired in August. That investigation prompted the attorney general and the state comptroller to start a criminal inquiry. Facing lengthy prison sentences, Mr. Ross, Mr. Friedman and Mr. Cohen all agreed to cooperate with investigators, according to defense lawyers. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

What is the answer: Who was Formula One Champion driver for 2013?","completion":"The Formula One World Champion driver for 2013 was Sebastian Vettel, a German racing driver who has made his mark as one of the most successful and dominant drivers in the history of the motorsport. Born on July 3, 1987, in Heppenheim, Germany, Vettel made his Formula One debut in 2007 at the age of 19 and has since stacked up numerous records and achievements. The 2013 Formula One season was a particularly remarkable year for Vettel, who was driving for the Red Bull Racing team at the time. The young driver managed to clinch his fourth consecutive world championship, further solidifying his position among the all-time greats of Formula One racing. Having already won three world championships in a row (2010, 2011, and 2012), Vettel displayed immense skill and determination during the 2013 season, winning 13 of the 19 races that year, including a record-breaking nine consecutive victories in the last nine races of the season. This incredible performance saw him amass a total of 397 points, easily eclipsing the scores of his closest competitors, Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and Mark Webber of Red Bull Racing, who finished the season with 242 and 199 points, respectively. In clinching the 2013 Formula One World Championship, Vettel joined an elite group of drivers who have won four consecutive titles, including Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. Additionally, his nine consecutive race wins matched the record held by Alberto Ascari since the 1952-1953 seasons. Beyond the 2013 season, Sebastian Vettel continued to build an impressive career in Formula One by joining Scuderia Ferrari in 2015, with whom he raced until 2020 before signing with the newly rebranded Aston Martin team (formerly Racing Point) for the 2021 season. With his remarkable skill, determination, and steadfast work ethic, Vettel remains one of the most formidable competitors in modern Formula One racing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Assess the options The options are november, rainy, dull, wet, and average. A human would analyze these options to determine which one is most relevant to the occurrence of lightning. Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant options - November: This is a month, not a type of day, so it is irrelevant to the question. - Dull: This is an adjective that describes a lack of excitement or interest and doesn't directly relate to weather conditions. - Average: This adjective suggests no significant weather conditions, which makes it less likely for lightning to happen. Step 4: Compare the remaining options Now, we are left with two options: rainy and wet. - Rainy: This describes a day with rain, which often results from stormy weather. Storms are associated with the occurrence of lightning, making this option a strong contender. - Wet: This simply describes the presence of moisture, which is not a direct indicator of storms or lightning but implies that rain has happened. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option After comparing rainy and wet, a human would realize that \\"rainy\\" is the most relevant option to the occurrence of lightning.

Answer: Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NF, though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a small number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause per se. Question: where do flesh eating bacteria live A:","completion":"Flesh-eating bacteria, also known as Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), are caused by various types of bacteria, with the most common being Group A Streptococcus (GAS). These bacteria, including other types such as Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Clostridium perfringens, live in different environments. Here is where these bacteria can commonly be found: 1. Group A Streptococcus (GAS): These bacteria are commonly found in the throat and on the skin of healthy individuals without causing any infection. However, when they enter the body through cuts, wounds, or weakened immune systems, they can potentially cause NF. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: This bacterium can be found on the skin and in the nasal passages of healthy individuals. It generally causes mild skin infections, but when it enters deeper tissues, it can also lead to NF. 3. Vibrio vulnificus: This bacterium is commonly found in warm seawater, particularly in areas with high salinity and temperatures. Exposure to this bacterium can occur through open wounds when swimming in seawater or through consumption of contaminated seafood, potentially leading to NF. 4. Clostridium perfringens: These bacteria are typically found in soil, dust, and often in the human gastrointestinal tract. In rare cases, they can enter the body through open wounds, leading to NF.

Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1. Alkalinity is the name given to the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize an acid, measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain, or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions, and which ph? Answer:","completion":"Alkalinity, also referred to as acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), is a critical parameter in assessing the ability of an aqueous solution or a stream to neutralize acidic pollutants, such as acid rain, and maintain a stable pH level. The measurement of alkalinity in water bodies is essential for understanding the ecological health and buffering capacity of water systems, as well as facilitating the management of water quality and protection of aquatic life. In general, alkalinity is primarily due to the presence of dissolved substances, such as bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbonate (CO32-), and hydroxide (OH-) ions, which can neutralize excessive hydrogen ions (H+) and reduce the acidity of water. These ions mainly originate from the weathering of rocks and minerals, dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and from within the water, and biological processes in the ecosystem. The pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, is a logarithmic measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. A pH value of 7 is considered neutral, where the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to that of hydroxide ions (OH-). When pH values are below 7, the solution is considered acidic, while values above 7 indicate that the solution is alkaline or basic. Acid rain refers to any form of unusually acidic precipitation, such as rain, snow, fog, or dew, with elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH) resulting from the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from anthropogenic sources, like burning fossil fuels, and some natural processes. The pH of unpolluted rain generally ranges from 5.0 to 5.6 due to the dissolution of carbon dioxide, while acid rain has a pH value between 4.2 and 4.4, and in extreme cases, it can be as low as 2. Concerning the relationship between alkalinity and pH, the ability of a stream to neutralize acidic pollution is directly linked to its alkalinity level; higher alkalinity tends to be associated with higher pH values and a better buffering capacity against acidity. Streams with low alkalinity are more susceptible to drastic pH changes that can harm aquatic life and destabilize the ecosystem. There is no specific pH value at which alkalinity is solely responsible for neutralizing acidic pollutants, as alkalinity depends on the concentration of bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide ions in the water and their ability to buffer against pH changes. Still, alkaline waters generally have pH values above 7. In conclusion, alkalinity represents the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution, like a stream, to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation with elevated levels of hydrogen ions. The measurement of alkalinity is vital for maintaining water quality and protecting aquatic life. Although there is no fixed pH value that solely represents alkalinity-induced neutralization, alkaline waters typically have pH values greater than 7, with better buffering capacities to counteract acidic inputs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more deforestation occurs happens, how will it affect HELPING owls to hunt at night. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more deforestation occurs, it will have an impact on the ability of owls to hunt at night. To understand how deforestation might affect the hunting process of owls, let's first examine the various stages of their hunting process and then consider the potential effects of deforestation on each of these stages. 1. Hunting territory: Owls typically hunt around their hunting territory, away from where they roost during the day. Deforestation can lead to the destruction of these habitats, reducing the available hunting grounds for owls. Areas of dense vegetation provide suitable nesting and roosting sites, so losing these can have an impact on the overall owl population. 2. Perching: Owls sit on perches like stumps or branches while waiting for prey. Deforestation results in the loss of trees that act as ideal perching spots for owls. Consequently, owls may have a harder time finding suitable spots to perch and, subsequently, hunt. 3. Sensitive hearing and keen vision: Owls rely on their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen and their extremely keen vision to see prey in the dark. The reduction in tree cover caused by deforestation may create more open spaces, which could make it more challenging for owls to locate prey using their excellent hearing and vision. Predators often rely on camouflage to blend in with their surroundings, and a more open hunting ground might expose them more easily to potential prey. 4. Silent flight: Owls fly silently, without flapping their wings, to surprise their prey. Deforestation may affect air currents and wind patterns due to the loss of trees, which can impact an owl's silent flight. This may make it more difficult for owls to approach their prey undetected. 5. Prey capture: The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak. Deforestation can disrupt the ecosystem, leading to a reduced number of prey species, making it harder for owls to find and take down prey. With fewer available prey, owls may have to expend more time and energy hunting for food. 6. Consumption and transportation of prey: The owl eats the prey or carries it back to its perch. Deforestation may force owls to travel longer distances for food, expending more energy in the process. This could lead to nutritional stress and potential decline in owl populations. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased deforestation has both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. The loss of habitat, shifts in ecosystems, and changes in the availability of suitable hunting grounds can have negative consequences on the owl's ability to hunt effectively at night. Consequently, deforestation can significantly impact the long-term survival and success of owl populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The man behind the Apple empire died at 56 last year. He was one of the people who made Silicon Valley the capital of technological invention. Author and business consultant Jim Collins once called Jobs the \\"Beethoven of business\\". When asked what Steve Jobs will be best remembered for, many of us would name a particular product:the iPod, the iPhone or the iPad, for example. But in the eyes of Eric Jackson, a reporter with Forbes magazine, Jobs brought the world much more than these popular devices . Here are some of the lessons he taught us: 1. The most lasting inventions mix art and science. Jobs pointed out that the team members working with Apple were trained in anthropology , art, history, and poetry. He believed this was important in making Apple's products stand out. 2. Never fear failure. Jobs was fired by the successor he himself chose. It was one of the most public embarrassments of the last 30 years in business. However, Jobs didn't hide away or try to get a new job. He _ and got back to work. 3. You can't look forward to connecting the dots--you can only look backward. This means that, however much we try to plan things ahead of time, life is always full of unexpected things. What seems like bitter pain and defeat could turn out to sow the seeds of unimaginable success in years to come. You can't connect the dots looking forward. But you have to trust that all the dots will be connected in the future. 4. Listen to that voice in tile back of your head that tells you if you're on the right track or not. Most of us simply decide that we're going to work in finance or become a doctor because it's what our parents tell us to do. Whatever your voice is telling you, it is smart to listen to it--like Jobs did. Just as Caroline and Amy from his empire put it, \\"Steve was one of the most inspiring yet toughest boss ever--but who else could have built Apple? What Steve left is sure to inspire generations of creative thinkers to think differently. His influence will be felt throughout the world.\\" Question: What's the writer's main purpose of writing the passage? Options: A: To introduce readers the life story of Steve Jobs. B: To tell readers Steve Jobs is the \\"Beethoven of business\\". C: To encourage readers to learn from Steve Jobs' life experience. D: To persuade readers that they shouldn't always follow what parents tell them to do. A:","completion":"The main purpose of the writer in writing the passage is C: To encourage readers to learn from Steve Jobs' life experience.

These contributions from Steve Jobs are detailed to inspire readers to learn and possibly apply them in their life or endeavors.

Here is a question about this article: Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people have always been centered around the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization. The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.

A deaf composer dubbed \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" confessed Wednesday to hiring someone to write his best-known works, leaving duped broadcaster NHK red-faced, and casting a cloud over a figure skater set to dance to his music in Sochi. Mamoru Samuragochi, 50, shot to fame in the mid-1990s with classical compositions that provided the soundtrack to video games including Resident Evil, despite having had a degenerative condition that affected his hearing. Samuragochi, who also spells his name Samuragoch, became completely deaf at the age of 35 but continued to work, notably producing \\"Symphony No.1, Hiroshima\\", a tribute to those killed in the 1945 atomic bombing of the city. In 2001 Time magazine published an interview with him, calling him a \\"digital-age Beethoven\\". \\"I listen to myself,\\" Samuragochi told the magazine. \\"If you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer. It is like communicating from the heart. Losing my hearing was a gift from God.\\" Samuragochi's reputation grew when public broadcaster NHK aired a documentary in March last year entitled \\"Melody of the Soul\\", in which it showed the musician touring the tsunami-battered Tohoku region to meet survivors and those who lost relatives in the 2011 catastrophe. The film shows Samuragochi playing with a small girl whose mother was killed in the disaster and apparently composing a requiem for her, despite his own struggles with illness. Viewers flocked in their tens of thousands to buy his Hiroshima piece, which became an anthemic tribute to the tsunami-hit region and its determination to get back on its feet, known informally as the symphony of hope. But on Wednesday morning the composer's life was revealed to have been a fraud, and an NHK anchor offered a fulsome apology for having aired the documentary. \\"Through his lawyer, Mamoru Samuragochi confessed early Wednesday that he had asked another composer to create his iconic works,\\" said the anchor. \\"NHK has reported on him in news and features programmes but failed to realise that he had not composed the works himself, despite our research and checking.\\" The statement, seen by AFP, offered an unqualified mea culpa. \\"Samuragochi is deeply sorry as he has betrayed fans and disappointed others. He knows he could not possibly make any excuse for what he has done,\\" it said. A man claiming to be the mystery ghostwriter, Takashi Niigaki, issued a statement late Wednesday, claiming that he had worked for Samuragochi for 18 years, TV Asahi said. NHK quoted Samuragochi as saying his deception had begun nearly two decades ago. \\"I started hiring the person to compose music for me around 1996, when I was asked to make movie music for the first time,\\" he said. \\"I had to ask the person to help me for more than half the work because the ear condition got worse.\\" Japanese Winter Olympics medal hopeful, figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, has also been caught up in the row. Takahashi's programme in Sochi includes a dance to a sonatina allegedly composed by Samuragochi that was unveiled two years ago, although in a statement posted on his website, Takahashi said none of his entourage had any knowledge of the deception and there were no plans to change the music. Nippon Columbia Co, which has sold his CDs and DVDs, said in a statement that the company was \\"flabbergasted and deeply infuriated\\" by his revelation. \\"We had been assured by him that he himself composed the works,\\" it said. A Nippon Columbia spokesman admitted that \\"Symphony No.1, Hiroshima\\" was an extraordinary hit for a classical music CD, selling 180,000 copies in a genre where a hit often only logs 3,000 sales. \\"But the company has decided to halt the shipment of his works,\\" he said, adding legal action against the fake composer was under consideration. oh/hg/lm ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen to an excerpt from Symphony No. 1 Hiroshima: Tokyo Symphony Orchestra / Naoto Otomo, courtesy DENON A deaf composer who has been dubbed \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" has admitted hiring someone else to write his music for nearly two decades. Mamoru Samuragochi shot to fame in the mid-1990s and is most famous for his Hiroshima Symphony No 1, dedicated to those killed in the 1945 atomic blast. The 50-year-old has now confessed he has not composed his own music since 1996. The real composer of the musician's \\"hits\\" has not been formally named. According to Japanese media, though, a man named Takashi Niigaki issued a statement on Wednesday claiming to be the \\"ghost\\" composer and to have worked for Samuragochi for 18 years. According to his now defunct website, Samuragochi was taught how to play the piano by his mother when he was four and began playing Beethoven and Bach when he was 10. He made his first breakthrough creating music for video games including Resident Evil and Onimusha. He completely lost his hearing when he was 35 but continued to compose music, apparently relying on his \\"absolute pitch\\". His Hiroshima Symphony No 1, completed in 2003, became a major classical music hit, selling more than 100,000 copies in Japan. It went on to become an anthemic tribute known informally as the \\"Symphony of Hope\\", after Samuragochi was filmed meeting survivors in the tsunami-battered Tohoku region in 2011. 'Mentally distressed' Apologising on his behalf, Samuragochi's solicitor said the musician was \\"deeply sorry as he has betrayed fans and disappointed others\\". \\"He knows he could not possibly make any excuse for what he has done. He is mentally distressed and not in a condition to properly express his own thoughts\\".

Japanese Winter Olympics hopeful, figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, has also been caught up in the scandal as his programme includes a dance to Samuragochi's Sonatina for Violin - also not penned by the musician. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A famous composer named Mamoru Samuragochi was known as \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" because he made beautiful music even though he was deaf.

Movie title: The Campaign Context: Democratic Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) of North Carolina's fictional 14th District is running for his fifth term unopposed. However his campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessmen brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Tim reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty. Cam later runs a campaign portraying Marty as an Al Qaeda terrorist, and Marty exposes Cam as a fake Christian by asking him to recite the Lord's Prayer, which he fails to do.

Possible answers: go wash his hands like his mom asked, talk on the phone about Return of the Jedi, finish his homework right on time Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it is most likely that Lee will talk on the phone about Return of the Jedi with Sasha. The scenario presented involves Sasha just having seen the new Star Wars movie and being excited about discussing it with Lee. This context creates an expectation that once Lee gets on the phone, the conversation will revolve around their shared interest in the Star Wars franchise, specifically the movie Return of the Jedi that Sasha just watched. It is possible that Lee's mom may have asked him to wash his hands or finish his homework earlier, before the phone call. However, these details are not mentioned in the context provided.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described above is the bat using the information gathered from the echolocation process to navigate its surroundings, avoid obstacles, locate prey, and perform other essential functions for its survival. In more detail, once the bat has successfully detected the presence, distance, and location of objects in its environment through the echolocation process, it must analyze and interpret this information to make decisions on how to react and adapt to its surroundings. This step involves the integration of sensory input and cognitive processing, allowing the bat to effectively use echolocation in various scenarios and contexts. For example, when hunting insects, a bat would interpret the echoed sound waves to determine the precise distance, size, and speed of the prey, in order to make a well-timed swoop and successfully catch it. Bats may also use echolocation to identify specific prey species, by recognizing the unique echolocation signatures of different insects. The bat's incredible auditory processing skills allow it to make these determinations in real-time, and make split-second adjustments to its flight path as needed. When navigating through its environment, the bat would use echolocation to avoid collisions with obstacles such as trees and buildings, by detecting the echoes reflected off of these surfaces and adjusting its flight path accordingly. Bats also use echolocation for social purposes, such as communicating with other bats and avoiding in-flight collisions within their roost. In summary, the final step of the process initiated by a bat flying through an area and using echolocation to detect objects in its surroundings is the interpretation and utilization of this information to effectively navigate, hunt, and interact within its environment. The bat's remarkable ability to process and make use of the auditory data gathered through echolocation reflects its advanced cognitive capabilities and adaptability, enabling it to thrive in diverse ecological niches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Lancy is a municipality of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. - The Republic and Canton of Geneva (; ) is the French-speaking westernmost canton or state of Switzerland, surrounded on almost all sides by France. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (e.g. Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), this canton is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation. - A photographer (the Greek (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\") is a person who makes photographs. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots. - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes. - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.

Combine these terms to simplify the equation. 0 = (252*b - 190*b) + 310 By subtracting -190*b from 252*b, you'll get: 0 = 62*b + 310 Step 2: Isolate b Now that you have simplified the equation, isolate b by moving the constant term, 310, to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 310 from both sides: 0 - 310 = 62*b + 310 - 310 This simplifies to: -310 = 62*b Step 3: Solve for b Lastly, to solve for b, you need to get b alone by dividing both sides of the equation by 62: -310 / 62 = 62*b / 62 The simplified equation is: b = -5 So, the solution for the equation 0 = 252*b - 190*b + 310 is b = -5."},{"prompt":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What building's opening did the artist who joined Royal Academy Schools in 1807 attend in 1838? is inside the article: William Etty (10 March 1787 – 13 November 1849) was an English artist best known for his history paintings containing nude figures. He was the first significant British painter of nudes and still lifes. Born in York, he left school at the age of 12 to become an apprentice printer in Hull. He completed his apprenticeship seven years later and moved to London, where in 1807 he joined the Royal Academy Schools. There he studied under Thomas Lawrence and trained by copying works by other artists. Etty earned respect at the Royal Academy of Arts for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones, but had little commercial or critical success in his first few years in London. Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, painted in 1821, featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All but one of the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although he was one of the most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press. An extremely shy man, Etty rarely socialised and never married. From 1824 until his death he lived with his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town's first art school and the campaign to preserve York city walls.

Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting.

Bison injures woman posing for selfie at Yellowstone Park Thursday, July 23, 2015, 9:35 AM YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. — Yellowstone National Park officials are warning tourists to keep their distance after a bison flipped a woman into the air as she posed for a selfie with the massive beast. The dangerous encounter was the fifth run-in between park-goers and buffalo this year. Park officials said the 43-year-old Mississippi woman turned her back on the animal to get a photo with it near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. Someone nearby saw the woman and her daughter about 6 yards from the animal and warned they were too close just before it came at them. They tried to run, but the bison caught the woman and tossed her with its head. The woman’s family drove her to a nearby clinic where she was treated for minor injuries. “The (woman) said they knew they were doing something wrong but thought it was OK because other people were nearby,” park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said. “People are getting way too close.” In separate incidents earlier this year, bison gored a 68-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl and tossed an off-trail teenager and an Australian tourist into the air. Five bison encounters resulting in injuries is unusual during a tourist season, Bartlett said. “We typically have one or two per year,” she said. One factor that could be contributing to added encounters is increased attendance at the park this year, Bartlett said. The park had more than 780,000 recreational visits in June, a 17 percent increase over June 2014 and 12 percent more than the previous record set in June 2010. July and August are the busiest months of the year for tourists. Yellowstone prohibits people from getting within 25 yards of bison and within 100 yards of bears and wolves.

Here is a question about this article: Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded 1 billion. The amount includes 477 million to the organization’s core resources and 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives. What is the answer to this question: How much of its funding was earmarked?","completion":"In 2014, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) received contributions from governments and the private sector exceeding 1 billion. These contributions were divided into two categories: core resources and earmarked funding. Earmarked funding refers to contributions designated for specific programs and initiatives. In this case, out of the total 1 billion contributions to the UNFPA, 529 million was earmarked for specific programs and initiatives. This means that over half of the funding received by UNFPA during that year was designated for particular purposes decided by the contributors, rather than being under the discretion of the organization. It's important to note that earmarked funding ensures that the contributor's priorities are addressed directly while offering transparency and demonstrating the impact of their funding. However, this also can pose certain challenges for the organizations, as they have to manage a higher degree of restrictions on the usage of funds and might encounter difficulties with long-term planning and sustainability. On the other hand, core resources such as the 477 million received by UNFPA in 2014 function as unrestricted funds that the organization can allocate and use according to their internal priorities and strategies. These funds provide more flexibility and autonomy in decision-making, which can help an organization in addressing pressing issues, implementing long-term plans, and allocating resources more efficiently. In conclusion, among the 1 billion contributions received by UNFPA in 2014, 529 million was earmarked for specific programs and initiatives, reflecting government and private sector priorities for leveraging their financial support while addressing global population and development challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"For example, in Standard English , one may say I am or he is, but not \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\".\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Absolutely, it would be a very reasonable answer. To elaborate, in the realm of linguistics and grammar, 'agreement' refers to the way in which different parts of a sentence must adjust in form to have a grammatically consistent relationship with one another. This agreement occurs in several essential linguistic features, such as number, person, gender, and case. Your example – \\"I am\\" versus \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\" versus \\"he is\\" – is a perfect illustration of agreement in terms of person and number in English grammar. In English, verbs need to agree with their subjects in both number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third person). The verb \\"to be\\" in the present tense, for instance, becomes \\"am\\" with the first person singular pronoun \\"I\\", \\"is\\" with the third-person singular pronouns \\"he\\", \\"she\\", or \\"it\\", and \\"are\\" with the second-person singular and all plural subjects. In the phrase \\"I am\\", the subject \\"I\\" is in the first person singular, and it agrees with the verb \\"am\\" which is also in the first person singular. Similarly, in the phrase \\"he is\\", the subject \\"he\\" is in the third person singular, and it agrees with the verb \\"is\\", which is also in the third person singular. These examples follow the conventions of standard English grammar. However, in the sentence \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\", the subject and the verb do not match in terms of person; \\"I\\" is a first person pronoun, but \\"is\\" is a third person form of \\"to be\\", and \\"he\\" is a third person pronoun while \\"am\\" is a first person form of \\"to be\\". The lack of consistency between the subject and the verb in terms of person makes these sentences incorrect according to the conventional rules of English, demonstrating how crucial agreement is to grammatical relationships. Overall, the concept of agreement is fundamental in ordering the relationships between different parts of a sentence and in ensuring that sentences in a language are grammatically accurate. Without agreement, there are potentially numerous different ways one could structurally arrange a language, leading to confusion and misunderstanding.

Question: who produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster ? Movie title: Gods and Monsters Movie plot: The story opens in the 1950s, after the Korean War; it has been more than a decade since James Whale, director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \\"locker room\\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with \\"his Monsters\\": Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from \\"ancient\\" movie fame. This event exacerbates his depression. A sudden rain storm becomes an excuse to leave. Back at Whale's home, Boone needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Boone wears a towel wrapped around his waist.
