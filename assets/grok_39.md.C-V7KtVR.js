School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in which Charles Dickens novel?","completion":"School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in the Charles Dickens novel \\"Hard Times\\" published in 1854. \\"Hard Times\\" is set in the fictitious industrial town called Coketown, located in the north of England during the time of the Industrial Revolution. The novel critiques many aspects of industrial life, including oppressive factory conditions, the exploitation of workers, and the dehumanizing effects of utilitarianism and the education system. Thomas Gradgrind is a central character in the story, representing the utilitarian educational philosophy prevalent during the 19th century. He is a man who values facts and statistics above all else in his pursuit of efficiency and pragmatism, and he is driven by a dogmatic belief in rationality. Dickens portrays Gradgrind as a harsh and unsympathetic character who suppresses imagination, creativity, and emotional growth in his students and children. Gradgrind runs a school where students are treated as machines tasked with absorbing and processing facts. In his school, the emphasis is on rationality and quantifiable metrics as opposed to developing well-rounded individuals capable of independent and moral thinking. His educational methods create unfeeling and unsympathetic individuals who struggle to deal with emotional challenges and relationships later in life. Throughout the novel, Gradgrind's perspective on education is challenged by various experiences and encounters with other characters that promote human compassion, love, and understanding. By the end of the novel, Gradgrind undergoes a personal transformation, recognizing that his extreme utilitarian views were flawed and that they negatively impacted his children's development. He comes to acknowledge the importance of imagination, empathy, and emotions in cultivating a healthier and more balanced society. In addition to presenting the dangers of a fact-based, utilitarian education, \\"Hard Times\\" explores themes such as class division, labor, and the impact of industrialization on society. Through his vivid depictions of Coketown and its inhabitants, Dickens provides a social commentary that invites readers to reflect on the human cost of the Industrial Revolution and the pursuit of a mechanical approach to life. In conclusion, School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in Charles Dickens' novel, \\"Hard Times,\\" published in 1854. The novel critiques the then-contemporary educational system and Industrial Revolution's consequences, with Gradgrind serving as a central figure who comes to understand the limitations and failings of his once unyielding utilitarian beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

If you don't, you may want to read the book We Can Do written by Moshe Kai Cavalin. It might change your mind. Moshe Kai Cavalin is a 14-year-old American boy. He is about to graduate from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) this year. Before that, he had already gotten a degree from East Los Angeles Community College in 2009. Recently, Cavalin published the book We Can Do. In this book, he talks about how to achieve things we want, by keeping yourself focused and trying your best to do everything. He says this doesn't need genius , just hard work. Cavalin says being called a genius \\"has always bothered me... People need to know they don't have to be geniuses; they just need to work hard and they can achieve anything. If I can reach the stars, others can reach the Milky Way(,).\\" The idea of writing a book came from a teacher named Richard Avila at his first college. Cavalin says Avila inspired him to write a book to explain how he succeeded, so he could inspire other people. It took Cavalin four years to finish the book.

In his book titled \\"We Can Do,\\" Cavalin discusses the importance of staying focused and putting in one's best efforts to achieve desired goals. He emphasizes that being a genius is not a prerequisite for success; rather, it is hard work that ultimately leads to achievement. Cavalin mentions that being called a genius has always bothered him, as he wants people to understand that they don't need to be geniuses to accomplish their goals. They merely need to work hard and commit themselves to their dreams and aspirations.

The process of writing and publishing his book took four years, and Cavalin even translated the book into Chinese on his own due to his mother's wishes. The book achieved success in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Thus, it is evident that Cavalin does not attribute his accomplishments to any inherent genius; rather, he credits them to hard work, focus, determination, and the support of those who inspired and motivated him along the way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary never forgets to wash the lettuce.\\" So, the complete sentence is: \\"Mary always makes a better salad than Victoria because Mary never forgets to wash the lettuce.\\" In this sentence, the comparison between the salads made by Mary and Victoria is being drawn, and the point being made is that Mary's salad preparation is better. The reason provided for Mary's superior salad-making is her attention to detail specifically, in the action of washing the lettuce. Cleaning and washing vegetables, including lettuce, is crucial in salad preparation as it helps remove dirt, bacteria, and potential pesticide residues that could potentially pose health risks to the consumers. By including this detail, the sentence emphasizes the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in the food preparation process. It suggests that because Mary always remembers to wash the lettuce, her salads are of higher quality than Victoria's. Additionally, based on the context provided, we can infer that Victoria might not always make it a priority to wash the lettuce, which could affect her salad's quality as well. Consequently, people might prefer Mary's salads over Victoria's, owing to the better preparation practices. To summarize, the sentence highlights Mary's commitment to maintaining cleanliness when making her salad, which results in a better dining experience for those who consume her food. By emphasizing such attention to detail, it underscores that a simple act like washing the lettuce can make a significant difference in the quality of the final product.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) MIAMI — Michael Cohen, who for years has served as President Trump’s personal attorney, has hired a lawyer of his own to help him navigate the expanding Russia investigation. Cohen confirmed Friday to The Washington Post that he has retained Stephen M. Ryan, a Washington-based lawyer from the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery who has experience prosecuting criminal cases as an assistant U.S. attorney. Cohen’s hiring of Ryan as his personal lawyer was first reported by Katy Tur of NBC News. Cohen’s decision is the latest indication that the Russia probe overseen by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is intensifying and could end up focusing on a number of Trump associates, both inside and outside the White House. [Trump lashes out at Russia probe; Pence hires a lawyer] Michael Caputo, a New York-based political operative and radio commentator who served as a senior communications adviser on Trump's campaign, also has hired a lawyer of his own to navigate the Russia probe. Caputo has retained Dennis C. Vacco, a former New York state attorney general and a partner at the law firm Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman. His hiring also was first reported by NBC's Tur. On Thursday, Vice President Pence’s office announced that the vice president had hired outside legal counsel, Richard Cullen, to assist him with inquiries from the Mueller investigation as well as congressional committee probes. During a Friday morning event here in Miami, The Post asked Pence whether he had any comment about hiring his own lawyer. The vice president said only: “It’s very routine. Very routine.” It is not entirely clear what role Cohen or Caputo might have in the Russia investigation. Cohen, who worked as a lawyer for the Trump Organization for a decade, made an appearance in the dossier compiled by a former British spy. The dossier, which was published online in January by BuzzFeed, alleged that he had traveled to Prague to meet with Russians and coordinate their hacking efforts. Trump has rejected the dossier as “fake news,” and Cohen has vigorously denied its allegations about him, noting he was in California at the time it alleged he had visited Prague. Congressional investigators asked President Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to turn over documents related to potential contacts with Russia and testify in front of Congress — but on May 30, Cohen said he'd refused to do so. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) In January, Cohen was involved in a separate incident that could potentially have drawn the attention of investigators. He has confirmed that he met with a Ukrainian lawmaker at a New York hotel at the urging of a former Trump business associate named Felix Sater. At the meeting, Sater gave Cohen a peace plan that the lawmaker had drawn up for his country that would have paved the way for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Russia after its 2014 military incursion in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that Cohen said he took the plan and left it in the White House office of then national security adviser Michael Flynn, days before Flynn resigned over his contacts with Russia's ambassador. Cohen told the Post that he had merely recommended Flynn as the proper recipient for the plan but that he had taken the written proposal home and thrown it away. [Amid Russia scrutiny, Trump associates received informal Ukraine peace proposal] Caputo, who briefly worked for the campaign, was an ally to former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. He lived in Moscow for several years in the 1990s, and briefly held a contract in 2000 with the Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media to improve Russian President Vladimir Putin's image in the United States. |||||Summary:","completion":"Michael Cohen, a long-time attorney and adviser of US President Donald Trump, has hired Stephen Ryan, a partner at the McDermott, Will and Emery law firm, to represent him in investigations exploring Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the shaft disconnects from the blades happens, how will it affect the core generates more. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process of electricity generation in a wind turbine, and it would lead to a halt in electricity production. Here's a breakdown of the process with the mentioned perturbation: 1. Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades. 2. The shaft of the turbine spins as a result of the movement of the blades. 3. Perturbation occurs: The shaft disconnects from the blades. This means that the spinning motion of the blades will no longer be transferred to the shaft. Due to the disconnection of the shaft from the blades, the following steps in the process will be affected: 4. Since the shaft is no longer spinning, it will not transfer the rotating motion to the generator. 5. As a result, the generator's rotor will not spin inside the core, which has magnets surrounded by wire loops. 6. Since the rotor is not spinning inside the core, no magnetic field is being induced, which means there will not be any generation of electricity. So, in summary, the perturbation of disconnecting the shaft from the blades has a direct and significant effect on the process. This is because the mechanical energy from the wind is no longer being converted into electricity due to the disruption in the energy transfer process. Such a perturbation in the system would result in an inability to generate electricity, as the mechanical motion driven by the wind is no longer being transferred downstream to the components responsible for electrical generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many dentists have training in how to treat patients with dental anxieties and fears. Don't hesitate to ask your dentist directly about whether he or she can handle fearful patients. It might take you a few tries to find a good fit, but you should call around or even find recommendations through friends or the internet. There will be a good dentist who can help you. Some ways that dentists can soothe an anxious patient include: Using water-based tools that minimize feelings of heat or vibration. Using oral or rub-on anesthetics before to provide pain relief before you receive a numbing shot. Having the option of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) available. Creating a spa-like environment, with relaxing music, aromatherapy, and a calm space. Providing noise-canceling headphones so that you do not have to hear the noise of the drill. Knowing relaxation and hypnosis techniques to help guide your breathing to keep you calm. Telling the patient what will happen so that the patient feels in control and safe. If you have a crippling anxiety of the dentist, you might want to look into the possibility of having your cavity filled while you are sedated. There are some extra risks from this option, and not every dentist uses sedative dentistry. However, there are many who will use sedatives to calm down a fearful patient. Be sure that you arrange for a friend or a taxi driver to take you home after the procedure. It is not safe to drive after waking up from sedation. While it might be tempting for you to use calming substances such as anti-anxiety medication or alcohol, you do not want to ingest anything that might interact poorly with dental anesthetics. Always talk to your dentist first about appropriate steps you can take to minimize your anxiety during a filling. Some people have dental fears because of bad experiences long ago. However, dentistry is much more sophisticated now. Anesthetics are more effective, drills are quieter, and there is a lot of new technology that can help a patient remain more comfortable. Try to keep an open mind about the dentist, and talk to your dentist about the tools that he or she uses. Keeping yourself distracted is a great way to ensure that you remain calm during your filling. There are a variety of techniques that you can use and discuss with your dentist. For example, you could: Prepare a soundtrack of your favorite relaxing music that you could listen to during the procedure. Memorize a poem or a mantra that you can recite mentally to keep yourself distracted. Use deep breathing techniques to minimize anxiety. It might be hard to do these with your mouth open, but some relaxing breathing techniques are still possible, such as breathing in through your nose for five seconds, holding for five seconds, and releasing for five seconds. Ask if you could have your filling done in a room with a television or screen with distracting or relaxing images. Having a friend or family member present can help keep you calm if you have trouble in the dentist's chair. Ask your dentist if she is comfortable with you having a loved one in the room with you to keep you grounded and to make sure that you are all right during the filling procedure. Summary:","completion":"Many people feel scared or anxious about going to the dentist. There are many things that can cause this fear, like not liking how your teeth look, being afraid of needles, or not liking the sound of the dental drill. To help with your fear, try to figure out where it comes from and talk to your dentist about it. They might be able to use new tools or techniques to make you feel more comfortable. For example, they might use water-based tools, give you pain medicine before the numbing shot, or play relaxing music during the appointment. If you're very worried, you could also think about getting your dental work done while you're asleep with a special medicine called a sedative. But, always remember to talk to your dentist about your feelings and ask for help if you need it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: A Conservative MP is set to introduce a bill that would give party caucuses significant powers — including the ability to vote out their leader. Michael Chong has been working on the private member's bill for years, and has become a standard-bearer for rebalancing the power between the Prime Minister's Office and Parliament. His proposed legislation would also give party riding associations the ultimate say in electoral nominations, removing the leader's signature from the equation for the first time since 1970. But the measures that focus on MPs are the most likely to stir debate in the House of Commons, particularly at a time when the power of the executive is in the spotlight. Details of how Prime Minister Stephen Harper's staff allegedly tried to manipulate a Senate committee report and an independent audit were laid out in an RCMP affidavit filed last week in court. Conservative sources familiar with Chong's bill say it's not a direct reaction to what's currently in the news, and wouldn't even come into effect until after the next election. Chong had been forced to introduce the bill or risk losing his place in the order of Commons consideration. When asked about the bill Friday, Chong said, \\"I'm going to wait until the bill is introduced in the House before providing public comment.\\" One measure would entrench in the Parliament of Canada Act that the different Commons caucuses — also referred to as parliamentary parties — have the power to trigger a leadership review vote, as long as 15 per cent of the caucus applies in writing for one. After that, a simple majority of MPs, 50 per cent plus one, could vote to turf the leader and have a leadership race. Members of Australia's Labour party caucus recently used that power to eject leader Julia Gillard, and Conservative MPs in Britain have the same power. In the case of Chong's bill, the power would be restricted to the House of Commons caucus, and not the larger national caucus that includes senators. Theoretically, the MPs would be cautious about how they vote because of their new, closer relationship to the riding associations that helped send them to Ottawa. The idea would also be to make political engagement more attractive to Canadians, with the knowledge they have more power at the grassroots level. Commons caucuses would also have the right to elect their own chairs and to call for a review of an MP, as well as to eject or readmit them. Right now, it is the prerogative of the leader alone — as Harper showed this year when MP Dean Del Mastro was shown the door after being charged under the Canada Elections Act. Chong's bill is expected to be introduced next Thursday, and would potentially see second reading debate in February or March. There is a quiet but substantial section of the Conservative caucus that has bridled against Harper's control, which has extended to their questions and votes in committees, and what they say on the floor of the Commons. This spring, they rallied behind MP Mark Warawa's bid to give MPs the right to make statements of their own choosing in the Commons. MP Brent Rathgeber left the Conservative caucus in June, complaining about the gradual transfer of power from members of Parliament to the Prime Minister's Office and cabinet. Chong is a popular figure in the Conservative caucus, regarded as a moderate and measured straight-shooter with a lot of integrity. He himself resigned from a cabinet post in 2006, saying he did not agree with a government motion recognizing Quebec as a nation. In order for Chong's private member's bill to fly, he will need more than just the support of his own colleagues — MPs from other parties will also need to come on board.

Summarize the following: People who are refined have opinions, but they tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room. Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational. If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict. If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead. You should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own. If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great. If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are. Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships. People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are. If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners. Be polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country. Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings. Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read. Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public. Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke. Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all. If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately. Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement.","completion":"The text emphasizes the importance of being refined and maintaining a dignified, polite, and respectful demeanor in social situations. Refined individuals tend to keep their negative opinions to themselves and avoid gossiping about others. They strive to be positive, even when discussing people who are not present. This includes being polite when disagreeing with someone and avoiding confrontational behavior. Refined people do not boast about their knowledge and accomplishments. Instead, they wait for appropriate moments in conversation to casually share their interests and expertise. They also make a habit of praising others for their achievements. Spending time with like-minded individuals is essential for refined people. They surround themselves with friends who can contribute to stimulating conversations and encourage personal growth. However, they also avoid dominating conversations and try to inquire about others, ensuring a balanced exchange of ideas. Good manners are a sign of refinement, and refined people always act considerately towards others. They make sure people around them feel comfortable by being polite, respectful, and attentive to their needs. They also have the sensitivity to be conscious of cultural differences and take the time to learn about ways of life in other parts of the world. Reading, attending cultural events, and staying informed about various topics is essential for a refined individual to be well-rounded and knowledgeable. They also possess tact in communication, being careful with their words and timing to avoid causing offense or embarrassing others. In summary, refined individuals maintain a polite, respectful, and considerate demeanor in all social situations. They avoid gossip and confrontation, share their knowledge modestly, surround themselves with like-minded people, exhibit good manners, and possess a broad understanding of various cultures and subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah and Jack had underestimated the amount of sand they would need to complete their project: constructing a large sandcastle as a surprise for their younger sister, Lily, who was celebrating her birthday the following day. Step 1: Assess the situation The first thing Sarah and Jack needed to do was determine how much more sand they might need for their project. They carefully analyzed the sandcastle's blueprint and determined that they would require at least six more buckets of sand to make their creation into a reality. Step 2: Gather more buckets Knowing they needed more containers to carry sand, the duo searched their house and the nearby beach for additional buckets or any other suitable alternatives. They scoured the area and managed to find four more buckets and an old laundry basket. Though not the perfect option, the laundry basket would help them collect much more sand at once. Step 3: Notify the family With their younger sister's birthday looming, Jack and Sarah decided to inform their parents about the surprise, ensuring that Lily wouldn't accidentally stumble upon their project site. Their parents were thrilled about the idea and promised to keep the secret from their youngest daughter. Step 4: Collect more sand Upon returning to the beach, Sarah and Jack began filling their newly-acquired buckets and the laundry basket with sand. Ensuring the sand was damp enough, they carried the additional sand back to the construction site. As they worked, their parents even stepped in to help, aiding in collecting more sand and speeding up the process. Step 5: Construct the sandcastle Once they had enough sand, Sarah and Jack followed the blueprint closely and began working on the sandcastle. They crafted walls, towers, and a grand entrance, along with intricate details inspired by actual medieval castles they had seen in history books. Step 6: Final touches As the day drew to a close, they put the finishing touches on their creation. They added seashells, driftwood, and seaweed to help decorate and stabilize the sandcastle. Finally, just as the sun began to set, they stood back and admired their hard work, taking satisfaction in knowing it was something their sister would love. The following day, Lily awoke to a series of clues cleverly staged by her siblings, leading her to where the sandcastle stood. When she arrived and saw the beautiful creation that Jack, Sarah, and their parents had built for her, she was overwhelmed with happiness. They had not only built Lily an incredible sandcastle, but they had also crafted a memory that would last a lifetime for the entire family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even though it claims to prioritize user privacy, the app's performance is utterly disappointing, leaving me more concerned than secure about my online activities. I was expecting a seamless and efficient experience, but all I got was a buggy and unstable app. I would strongly recommend potential users to avoid this app and look for better alternatives to protect their online privacy. I hope the developers take user feedback into account and improve this app, as it has great potential if not for its current shortcomings.

There are smaller and less destructive pets to make your dormitory life colorful. Betta fish They make great pets with their big personality and astonishing colors, ranging from bright red, dark blue to lemon yellow.

Chinchillas Without bad smell, about the size of a rabbit and with fur so dense that they can't get pests such as fleas , the friendly creature originally from the Andes Mountains in South America makes an ideal indoor pet. Chinchillas are very social animals, so if you only have one, you will become its family. In cold winter days, in a glance at this fury pet in a dorm will bring you a lot of warmth.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Mark decides he want a cold drink and puts a bottle of warm water in his freezer. By doing this he makes the water colder and as water cools its density increases eventually freezing and becoming a solid, Ice. After a while mark forgets that he put the bottle of water in the freezer. He eventually remembers and comes back to check and the bottle of water is frozen solid. Because of this he leaves the bottle out on his kitchen counter for a few hours and returns to a nice cold bottle of water. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will lowering the temperature of water cause it's density to increase or decrease? Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Lowering the temperature of water will cause its density to increase initially, up to the point it reaches its highest density at around 4°C. Beyond 4°C, as the temperature decreases further and water starts to freeze, its density will decrease due to the unique behavior of water and the formation of a hexagonal crystal structure in ice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he is watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South...

He has successfully conquered some of the world's highest and most challenging peaks, leaving most speechless with his daring exploits. Anker is portrayed as a lone wolf, a man who prefers relying on no one but himself. - Cara Strickland, a talented journalist, is approached by a daring outdoor sports magazine to explore and document Anker Jensen's captivating life story. A deal is struck, and Cara sets out to secure an interview with the elusive and enigmatic Anker, in hopes of witnessing his incredible feats firsthand. - Cara catches up with Anker at the base of a particularly arduous mountain range, and, after an initially hostile encounter, she convinces him to let her accompany him and his climbing partner, Max, on their next expedition. With a professional documentary crew in tow, they make their way to a legendary mountain called \\"The Unchained Ascent,\\" a peak that has never been successfully scaled through free climbing. Act 2: - As the group journeys towards the base of The Unchained Ascent, Cara slowly uncovers Anker's troubled past. Born in a small mountain village in Scandinavia, Anker's passion for climbing began at an early age. However, tragedy struck when his best friend and former climbing partner, Lukas, died during an attempt to climb the infamous \\"Bitter Peak\\". Anker was left with a heavy heart and blame on his shoulders from the climbing community. Struggling with guilt and anger, he chose to move forward by conquering even more challenging heights. - Anker, Cara, Max, and the documentary crew arrive at the base of The Unchained Ascent, only to find that a team of rival climbers, led by the cunning and deceitful Sebastian, are also planning to scale the mountain. Anker faces a test not only of his climbing skills but also his ability to trust, as he must rely on Cara, Max, and the crew to outmaneuver and outclimb the rival team. - As they ascend the mountain, Anker and Max face extreme weather conditions, technical challenges, and hair-raising near-death experiences.

Privacy activists criticized last month's announcement. They are concerned that the new policy will make it easier to track the activities of users across Google's many products -- from Gmail to YouTube. Marc Rotenberg heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. He says Google's aim is to create a single unified profile of its users. \\"We believe that not only is that a threat to privacy, we actually believe it is illegal, because last year Google entered into an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission in which they said they would not engage in that kind of data sharing without the permission of their users.\\" Google says its new policy will make it simpler for users to share information across services like Google Search, Gmail and Google Calendar. And it says the new policy will help personalize each user's experience. Over time, it says, users can expect to see better search results, fewer unwanted advertisements and more content targeted to their interests. But Marc Rotenberg says in return, people who choose to use Google will lose control over the information they share. \\"The type of information you might provide for an e-mail service, for example, such as your address book, which contains private information, is different from the type of information that you might provide for a social network service where people purposely make information publicly available to their friends.\\" Mr. Rotenberg says these two kinds of services should be kept separate. \\"By trying to combine these two services, in our view, Google is actually undermining a very well established expectation of privacy, especially for popular Internet services like electronic mail.\\" Critics also see a bigger problem with Google's new policy.

Coming off their last-second home loss to Chicago, the Eagles ground out a 23-16 victory on the road against a Minnesota Vikings team coached by former Andy Reid protege Brad Childress. Rookie phenom Adrian Peterson and quarterback Kelly Holcomb, who spent the offseason on the Eagles' roster, took the Vikings down the field for the game's first score - a nine-yard touchdown pass to Visanthe Shiancoe. A 50-yard reception by Greg Lewis down the field set up David Akers' first field goal, then Donovan McNabb guided the Eagles to a touchdown drive early in the second quarter, with Brian Westbrook the recipient of a short six-yard scoring pass. Westbrook carried it up the middle from the one-yard line on Philadelphia's next drive to make it 17-7.

In this context, the reviewer appears to express a certain level of dissatisfaction with the length of the movie, seemingly describing it as excessive or unnecessarily prolonged. The word \\"indulgent\\" is crucial in determining the overall sentiment. In this case, \\"indulgent\\" usually implies that something is overly generous or lenient, often to the point of excess or extravagance. Consequently, by describing the movie's length as indulgent, the reviewer seems to be saying that it was excessive, as if the filmmakers were excessively extending the runtime without much constraint. As a result, the reviewer may be suggesting that the movie could have been more engaging or enjoyable if its duration had been trimmed down to a more reasonable time. Furthermore, the specific mention of \\"two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length\\" highlights the emphasis on the movie's extended runtime. The careful choice of words signifies that the reviewer felt it was important to point out the exact duration of the film, potentially indicating that it was a significant factor in their overall assessment of the movie.

A second video of Justin Bieber allegedly making racist jokes has reportedly surfaced. British tabloid newspaper The Sun reports that the new footage features the singer using the N-word in \\"One Less Lonely Girl\\" (altering the hook to be \\"One Less Lonely N-----\\"), joking about killing black people and entertaining the idea of joining the Ku Klux Klan. Though the undated video is not included in the online report, The Sun claims that that it shows Bieber seated and wearing a dog tag and a dark blue shirt, and he sings unaccompanied, repeatedly weaving the racial slur into the lyrics of his 2009 hit. The footage emerges just as Bieber issued an apology on Sunday for a five-year-old clip -- originally recorded when the singer was 15 but recently posted by The Sun -- that shows the pop star telling a joke with a racist punchline. The earlier video has since been posted on TMZ. In that clip, Bieber is heard asking, \\"Why are black people afraid of chain saws?\\" He then answers his own questiony with a reference to the N-word. \\"Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake, and I'm grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man,\\" he apologized. \\"Once again … I'm sorry.\\" PHOTOS: Stars Behaving Badly — From Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon, Hollywood's Recent Mugshots That first video could've been kept away from the public, TMZ reports.

The lawyer allegedly attempted to persuade Bieber's team to pay as much as 1 million to stop him from selling the footage to the media. The videos follow Bieber's attempted robbery investigation in May, detainment at the Los Angeles International Airport in April, DUI arrest in March and alleged egging incident in January. His Miami trial for driving under the influence and other charges will begin on July 7, after his lawyers asked for it to be delayed to examine evidence and discuss whether to accept a possible plea deal. |||||Summary:","completion":"A focused crawl is when people collect information from a specific part of the internet, not the whole thing.

Given the question: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant.

It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

Movie title: Mother's Day Context: In a Growth Opportunity graduation, couple Terry and Charlie are offered a ride from an old woman where they are driven into the woods. After the old woman's car is stalled, two inbred killers appear and attack; Charlie is decapitated with a machete in the backseat while Terry is brutally assaulted before being garroted by the old lady. It is revealed that the dual killers named Ike and Addley are the woman's sons, who is nicknamed Mother. Meanwhile, three adult women with a long-time friendship, Abbey, Jackie, and Trina, are reunited every year for a camping trip at Deep Barons. After stopping at a nearby store for supplies, they arrive at their destination and begin to camp. While in the woods, they begin to explore, sitting around the campfire telling stories and having fun by swimming and fishing, unbeknownst that they are being stalked by Ike and Addley. At night, the two brothers capture the three women in their sleeping bags and bring them to Mother's cabin residence in the woods. It is revealed that the brothers live alongside with Mother, in which they are raised to commit acts of rape, violence, and murder to impress her. After the girls are tied up inside the cabin, Jackie is first taken by Mother and the deranged brothers who torture her outside with abuse and assault.

Article: Opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first longspan bridge to carry motor traffic, and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century. Spanning New York's East River, it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer--1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time. Question: According to the passage, which of the following correctly describes John Augustus Roebling? - He participated in the Civil War and was seriously wounded. - He was the first person to propose the construction of the bridge. - He was chosen to design the bridge because of his aggressive views. - He moved to America because he was discriminated against in his home country.","completion":"According to the passage, the correct description of John Augustus Roebling is: - He moved to America because he was discriminated against in his home country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: With its walls left to crumble, and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases, it's easy to imagine how Overstone Hall might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep. However, the Northamptonshire stately home's troubles run far deeper than that. Right from its first owner - Lord Overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and, since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago, it has been up for sale for a mere £1million but without any interest. Scroll down for video. Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire was hated by Lord Overstone whose wife commissioned the vast property in 1860 and has never been wanted by any of its owners. The stately home boasts 114 rooms, occupying 20,000sq ft and sits on 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. The 19th century stately home boasts 114 rooms in 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. Lady Overstone commissioned the Elizabethan and Renaissance style building in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. Unfortunately her husband Lord Overstone hated the design, built by architect William Milford Teulon, and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends. 'The new house, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation,' wrote Lord Overstone. 'It is an utter failure, although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste, comfort nor convenience. I am utterly ashamed of it.' Lord Overstone despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883. The lounge inside Overstone Hall in the 1920s when it was owned by Sir Philip Stott who used it as a training base for Conservative party members. Sir Philip Stott who wanted to turn it into a training base for the Conservative Party disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928, before it was sold to the Charlotte Mason Schools Company. Lord Overstone (left) declared that he did not like the mansion his wife had designed and gave it to his daughter Lady Wantage (right) on his death in 1883. Lady Overstone commissioned the Victorian hodgepodge of Elizabethan and Renaissance architectural style in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. The mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house. A fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in April 2001, including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties, so it was sold in 1920. In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties. After she died in 1920, the property was sold to Sir Philip Stott who intended to use it as a training base for Conservative party members. However he condemned the scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928. It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls' boarding school. Lord Overstone hated the house so much that he refused to live there, saying: 'It is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation' The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God, which is asking for the same price. Lord Overstone's daughter, Harriet, inherited the house after his death. Overstone Park was acquired by Lewis Loyd, father of Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone, for £117,500 in 1832. On the death of Lewis Loyd in 1858, the house and 10,000 acres of land became Lord Overstone’s property. The banker and politician had married Harriet, daughter of Conservative politician Ichabod Wright, in 1829. Together they had one son, who died as an infant, and a daughter The Honourable Harriet Sarah Jones Loyd in 1829. In 1860 Lady Overstone decided to engage the architect William Milford Teulon to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste. She was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale. But she commissioned a design with a mixture of Elizabethan and Renaissance features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the Victorian era. Lady Overstone died before the house was completed in November 1864 and left her husband a widower. He hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend: 'The New House, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation. It is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension, it has neither taste, comfort, nor convenience.' He refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter Harriet on his death in 1883,. One of the most revered heiresses of her time, she was a noted philanthropist, and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work. In November 1858 she married Robert James Lindsay, who assumed the name of Loyd-Lindsay by deed poll. Early on, they became the owners of two fine country places - Overstone Park, Northampton, and Lockinge House, Wantage, where the couple chiefly resided. She only used the Overstone estate occasionally for winter hunting parties, as her main home was in Oxfordshire. With her husband, a former distinguished soldier and Victoria Cross hero, she was instrumental in establishing the National Aid Society, which was really the forerunner of the British Red Cross Society. Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting, saying it has been reclaimed by nature.

It's hard to judge the interior because there's so little of it left but the few rooms that did remain were far too big and drafty.

The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began to return to a hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.

These men came all the way from Iceland, a faraway snowy country. They were very excited to go skydiving on that sunny Saturday, but something went very wrong. You see, when they jumped out of the airplane, they were wearing parachutes to help them float gently from the sky. But, both of their main parachutes didn't open! No one knows why it happened. Maybe something distracted them while they were falling through the sky. Now, the people who are in charge of finding out what happened, called authorities, are trying to solve this mystery. They think that a special camera, which one of the men wore on his helmet, might have some clues about the accident. Even though their main parachutes didn't open, they had extra reserve parachutes. These opened automatically, on their own. But, it was too late. The reserve parachutes didn't have enough time to slow them down, and sadly, both men passed away. This was their third jump of the day, and they were having so much fun before the accident happened. Skydiving is a fun sport where you can feel like you're flying. Over time, it has become safer, but sometimes accidents still happen. Last year, out of 3.1 million jumps in the United States, 19 people died while skydiving. So, everyone needs to be very careful and pay attention while skydiving. We hope that the authorities can learn something from this sad story, and help make skydiving even safer for everyone who wants to touch the sky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \\"Popish Plot\\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes. Based on the above article, answer a question.

English club Liverpool qualified for the knockout stages of Europe's second-tier Europa League on Thursday along with Paris St. Germain, Besiktas and Dynamo Kiev. Liverpool continued their minor revival since the arrival of new American owners, but allowed second-placed Steaua Bucharest to come from behind and earn a 1-1 draw. Serbia international Milan Jovanovic headed in a 19th-minute cross from Dutch winger Ryan Babel, but Spanish goalkeeper Jose Reina allowed the home side to level with half an hour to play as he failed to keep out a header by Eder Bonfim. That kept Roy Hodgson's team three points clear ahead of the final Group K match at home to Utrecht on December 15. The Dutch club are five points behind their upcoming opponents following a 3-3 draw at home to Napoli -- who have also drawn four of their five matches. Balotelli double helps Manchester City qualify. Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick to help the Italian club come from 3-1 down and end their hosts' hopes of progressing, while the Serie A outfit can through to the last 32 by winning at home to the Romanians next month. Paris St. Germain qualified with a 4-2 victory over Sevilla that lifted the French side two points clear of the second-placed Spaniards in Group J. Mathieu Bodmer and Guillaume Hoarau scored from two early corners by Nene before the Brazilian midfielder made it 3-0, then Mali striker Fredi Kanoute netted a double for the visitors. Hoarau's second goal just after halftime left Sevilla needing a point from their final game at home to Borussia Dortmund to progress. The Germans kept their hopes alive with a 3-0 win at home to pointless Ukrainian side Karpaty Lviv. In Group L, Turkish side Besiktas went through with a 2-1 win at Bulgaria's CSKA Sofia. Portugal's Porto, who had already qualified, ensured top spot with a 3-1 win at Rapid Vienna, as Colombian striker Falcao scored a hat-trick to move top of the goal charts with seven. Russian club CSKA confirmed top spot in Group F, winning 5-1 at home to bottom Swiss club Lausanne for a fifth straight win. Czech side Sparta Prague will go through in second after drawing 2-2 at Palermo, with the Italian side having two players sent off. In Group D, Spanish side Villarreal moved into top spot with a 3-0 win at home to Dinamo Zagreb, with Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi scoring twice including a first-half opener from the penalty spot.

As highlighted, a woman who eats an average amount of rice would get 49 percent of the maximum recommended arsenic \\"dose\\" from that one source. ||||| A new University of Washington study that tested 65 wines from America's top four wine-producing states -- California, Washington, New York and Oregon -- found all but one have arsenic levels that exceed what's allowed in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows drinking water to contain no more than 10 parts per billion of arsenic. The wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. But a companion study concluded that the likely health risks from that naturally-occurring toxic element depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. The highest risks from arsenic exposure stem from certain types of infant formulas, the study estimated. The two studies from UW electrical engineering professor Denise Wilson appear on the cover of the October 2015 issue of the Journal of Environmental Health. \\"Unless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there's little health threat if that's the only source of arsenic in your diet,\\" said Wilson. \\"But consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice -- all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning -- you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly.\\" Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is toxic to humans in some forms, and can cause skin, lung and bladder cancers, and other diseases. As rain, rivers or wind erode rocks that contain arsenic, it leaches into water and soil. From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. The UW study is the first peer-reviewed research in decades to look at the arsenic content of American wines. As a group, they had higher arsenic levels than their European counterparts, likely due to the underlying geology of U.S. wine growing regions. The study looked at red wines, except from two areas in Washington where only white wines were produced, because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. Wilson also tested for lead, which is a common co-contaminant. The study found lead in 58 percent of the samples, but only 5 percent -- all from New York -- exceeded drinking water standards. Washington wines had the highest arsenic concentrations, averaging 28 parts per billion, while Oregon's had the lowest, averaging 13 parts per billion. \\"There were no statistical differences among Washington, New York and California,\\" she said. \\"The only star in the story is Oregon, where arsenic concentrations were particularly low.\\" Where possible, the study also compared wines grown in \\"new\\" vineyards and those that had been converted from other agricultural uses like orchards, where farmers likely used arsenic-based pesticides that were popular in the early 20th century. It found some evidence that higher levels of arsenic in Washington red wines could be a result of pesticide residue. Because the average adult drinks far more water (between 1.7 and 3.2 cups per day) than even core or frequent wine drinkers (roughly a half cup per day on average), it's an imperfect comparison to gauge health risks based on the EPA drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion. That's why Wilson also evaluated how much arsenic individuals can safely consume from all the sources in their diet. In a companion study, she compiled consumption data for foods that have been shown to contain arsenic -- juice, milk, bottled water, wine, cereal bars, infant formula, rice, salmon and tuna. From that, she was able to determine how much of an arsenic \\"dose\\" an average child or adult would get from each food source and how close it would come to risk thresholds set by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry for total arsenic consumption across a person's diet. For the core or frequent adult wine drinker, the arsenic consumed from that single source would only make up 10 to 12 percent of the total maximum recommended daily arsenic intake. But if that person also eats large quantities of contaminated rice, tuna or energy bars, for instance, that could push that individual's arsenic consumption beyond levels that are considered safe. A person who eats an average or large amount of contaminated rice would get between 41 and 101 percent of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that one source alone, the study found. A child who drinks apple juice could get a quarter of the maximum daily arsenic dose from that single source. The food that posed the largest risk of arsenic poisoning was infant formula made with organic brown rice syrup, an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Wilson estimated that some infants eating large amounts of certain formulas may be getting more than 10 times the daily maximum dose of arsenic. Based on recent studies that have found arsenic in numerous foods and beverages, Wilson recommends that U.S. wineries test for arsenic and lead in irrigation and processing water and take steps to remove those contaminants if levels are found to be high. But rather than litigate against vineyards - as some have done - she would encourage consumers to evaluate their diets more holistically and speak with a doctor if they have concerns. Tests are available that can detect high arsenic levels and tend to capture arsenic exposure over longer histories than other toxic chemicals. \\"The whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard,\\" Wilson said. \\"My goal is to get people away from asking the question 'who do we blame?' and instead offer consumers a better understanding of what they're ingesting and how they can minimize health risks that emerge from their diets.\\" # For more information, contact Wilson at denisew@uw.edu or 360-969-5959.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

Donald diet.","completion":"Ian told Donald that he was going to try eating amaranth in order to improve Ian's diet. He had recently heard about the numerous health benefits of this ancient grain and was eager to incorporate it into his daily meals. Amaranth, known scientifically as Amaranthus, is a group of over 60 different species of grains that have been cultivated for about 8,000 years. These grains were once considered a staple food in the Inca, Maya, and Aztec civilizations. Amaranth is classified as a pseudocereal, which means it's not technically a cereal grain like wheat or oats but consumed similarly and has a similar nutritional profile. Ian had been researching various ways to enhance his diet and overall well-being when he stumbled upon amaranth. He was fascinated by its rich history and the various health benefits it provides. Some of the key benefits of incorporating amaranth into one's diet include: 1. High Nutritional Value: Amaranth is an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, including calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is also rich in protein and contains all essential amino acids, making it a complete protein source. 2. Gluten-Free: For individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, amaranth is a great alternative to wheat and other gluten-containing grains. This makes it an attractive option for those who struggle to find nutritious gluten-free options. 3. Promotes Digestive Health: Amaranth is high in dietary fiber, which assists in maintaining healthy digestion. Dietary fiber is crucial for maintaining regular bowel movements, reducing constipation, and promoting overall digestive health. 4. Supports Heart Health: Amaranth contains potassium, which helps balance the body's fluid levels and maintains a healthy blood pressure. It also has low sodium content and contains antioxidants that may decrease the risk of heart disease. 5. Boosts Immunity: Amaranth is packed with antioxidants, including vitamin E and selenium, which may protect the body from harmful free radicals and boost the immune system. 6. Aids in Weight Management: Due to its high fiber and protein content, amaranth can help keep you full for longer periods, reducing the urge to snack on unhealthy foods between meals. Ian shared his newfound knowledge about amaranth with Donald and encouraged him to consider adding it to his own diet as well. He even suggested some delicious ways in which they could both start incorporating this superfood into their meals: 1. Cooked Amaranth Porridge: They could simply cook amaranth in water or milk and enjoy it as a warm breakfast porridge, topped with fresh fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey. 2. Amaranth Vegan Burgers: Ian found a recipe for vegan burgers using amaranth, black beans, and spices, making for a protein-rich and delicious meat alternative. 3. Amaranth Salads: They could add cooked amaranth to their salads, providing a hearty and filling base that would fuel them throughout the day. 4.

The teenagers were shot dead by police outside the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray where they had killed Father Jacques Hamel, 86, and taken hostages. So-called Islamic State (IS) released a video of what it said were the two men pledging allegiance to the group. \\"Following DNA tests, it emerged that the terrorist has been identified as Abdel Malik Nabil Petitjean,\\" a source in the Paris prosecutor's office said. Petitjean, from a town in eastern France, had been on a watch list as a potential security threat since June after trying to enter Syria from Turkey. He had been harder than Kermiche to identify because his body was badly disfigured in the police shooting, but officers found an ID card belonging to him in Kermiche's home and confirmed his identity in a DNA match with his mother. After Petitjean was named, his mother, Yamina, denied he could have been the killer. \\"I know my kid, he is kind. I did not produce a devil. He never talked about IS,\\" she told BFM television.

Amaq news agency, the media arm of IS, later released a second video of Petitjean, this time speaking alone and threatening France. French media have reported sources close to the investigation as saying anti-terrorism police had been searching for a man in the days before the attack who \\"strongly resembled\\" Petitjean, after receiving a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency about an imminent attack. A photograph of the man said to be planning the attack had been supplied but not his name. Kermiche, also 19, was being monitored by police and was wearing a surveillance tag at the time of the attack. He was arrested twice last year trying to reach Syria and was awaiting trial for alleged membership of a terrorist organisation. It is being reported that Kermiche sent out audio messages on social media proclaiming his intention of carrying out an attack, days before the pair struck. Sent to about 200 followers on the messaging service Telegram, the messages were encrypted and never reached the eyes or ears of French intelligence, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports. The French government has faced strong criticism from political opponents over perceived security failings since the Bastille Day lorry attack in Nice two weeks ago in which more than 80 people died. President Francois Hollande has said France will form a National Guard from reserve forces, in an attempt to prevent further attacks. He has urged \\"patriots\\" to sign up to become reservists and has said parliamentary consultations on forming the Guard will take place in September \\"so this force can be created as fast as possible to protect the French\\". The comments came two days after Kermiche and Petitjean stormed the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, a suburb of Rouen, during morning Mass. They slit the throat of the elderly priest before being killed by police. One of four people taken hostage - said to be an elderly parishioner - suffered severe knife wounds.

Birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be molted. The timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation. How do birds store energy?","completion":"Birds store energy primarily through the accumulation of fat in their bodies, which serves as a critical energy reserve during migration. This enables them to have enough energy to sustain them during their long and often strenuous journeys. Fat deposits are built up by consuming a surplus of food and nutrients in the weeks or even months leading up to migration. These fat stores are then tapped into and metabolized as the bird requires extra energy to fuel its flight. In addition to fat accumulation, some physiological adaptations can help birds regulate their energy use more efficiently during migration, such as controlling sleep patterns in nocturnal migrants. Behavioral changes, like flying in flocks, can also help to reduce the energy expenditure required for migration by taking advantage of aerodynamic benefits and minimizing the individual bird's exertion. Overall, the combination of accumulating fat reserves, physiological adaptations, and behavioral changes allows birds to effectively store and manage energy for successful migration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a new situation: Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. But I can use this background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. What is an answer for this question: In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze the background information provided and apply it to the different cases of the African Buffalo herd sizes. The dilution effect suggests that group living evolves because of the benefits to individual animals, rather than the group as a whole. As the group size increases, each individual's risk of being attacked decreases. This is illustrated in the examples provided, such as fish shoaling, Camargue horses, and water striders. Now, let's consider the African Buffalo cases: - Case A: Buffaloes living in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds - Case B: Buffaloes living in a small herd In case A, the individual buffaloes are part of a large herd, which would dilute their individual risk of attack. The overall benefit for the group in terms of reducing the risk of predation for each individual would be higher in this case. In case B, the individual buffaloes are part of a smaller herd. This would result in a higher individual risk of attack compared to case A since the dilution effect is less pronounced in smaller groups. As the question asks which scenario would result in less benefit for the group as a whole, it would be more appropriate to consider case B. In this situation, the smaller group size provides less benefit from the dilution effect compared to case A, where the larger group size would provide more significant benefits to individual buffaloes in terms of reduced risk of predation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trivia question: What is the address of the British Prime Minister? And the answer is?","completion":"The address of the British Prime Minister is 10 Downing Street, which is colloquially known as \\"Number 10.\\" Located in the City of Westminster in London, England, 10 Downing Street is the official residence and office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The street acquired its name from Sir George Downing, who was a statesman and diplomat during the reigns of King Charles II and King James II. He constructed the street in the 1680s, and it has since become synonymous with the Prime Minister and the government of the United Kingdom. 10 Downing Street has been the official residence for British Prime Ministers since 1735 when King George II gave it to Sir Robert Walpole, who was the First Lord of the Treasury and regarded as the first effective Prime Minister of Britain. Since then, it has been home to some of the most influential leaders in British history, including Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and more recently, Boris Johnson. The building is made of yellow brick and includes both living quarters for the Prime Minister and their family as well as numerous offices and meeting rooms for the staff. At the heart of 10 Downing Street is the Cabinet Room, where high-level government meetings and decisions take place. In addition to its significance as the residence of the Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street has also played a crucial role in British history. Important policy decisions, pivotal meetings, and historic speeches have all taken place within its walls. Despite its high-profile status and public prominence, 10 Downing Street is well-protected, with extensive security measures in place due to potential terrorist threats and other risks. Access to the street is restricted to authorized personnel, and members of the public are generally only able to view the iconic black door from behind a gated barrier. In conclusion, 10 Downing Street is the famous address of the British Prime Minister, where living quarters are provided along with the necessary office space for the government administration. As a physical representation and symbolic location of political power in the United Kingdom, 10 Downing Street remains an essential part of British history and political life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Broadway actress has become the seventh woman to allege former President George H.W. Bush groped her during a photo op. Megan Elizabeth Lewis, 38, tells NJ Advance Media that Bush forcibly touched her after he asked her to take a photo with him at a performance of \\"Legally Blonde: The Musical\\" in Houston in 2009. Her claim follows directly on the heels of a Time magazine story in which Roslyn Corrigan claimed Bush groped her in 2003, when she was 16, during a visit the former president made to a Texas CIA office where her father worked as an intelligence officer. As with the alleged Corrigan episode, Lewis said Bush was not in a wheelchair at the time her incident happened. Lewis, who lives in Brooklyn, said she hadn't asked for a photo with the former president, who was then 84, when he came to the show at Houston's Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in February of 2009. But she said he asked her to take one with him, so she approached him. The actress prepared herself for the photo by making a funny face, as she often does when posing. Bush, she said, made a comment about Barbara Bush -- who was also in attendance -- being \\"his silver fox,\\" before allegedly groping Lewis as she mugged for the camera. \\"He grabbed my butt and I was like 'wow,'\\" she said. \\"I remember being really grossed out.\\" \\"I was just disappointed,\\" Lewis added pointing to Bush's alleged comment about Barbara Bush just moments before. \\"You just implied to me that you love your wife very much.\\" Lewis said she also decided to speak out because she was upset to read that a spokesman for Bush seemed to partially attribute his behavior to the fact that he uses a wheelchair. (The former president has vascular parkinsonism, a syndrome that mimics Parkinson's disease and causes problems with walking and balance.) In a statement issued on Oct. 25 in answer to an allegation that the former president had groped a woman in 2014, Jim McGrath, the spokesman, did not deny the claim, but said that because Bush uses a wheelchair, his \\"arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures.\\" Yet Lewis said when Bush, who's now 93, grabbed her, he was not using a wheelchair. \\"He was standing tall, well-dressed, and had the wherewithal to make small talk with a room full of actors,\\" she said. The cast had been told the Bushes would be in attendance that night, but Lewis hadn't planned to ask for a photo. \\"The way that he engaged me (when) I have no intention of being part of it, it seems like that was the way he got his jollies,\\" she said. Bush's spokesperson McGrath did not respond on Tuesday to a request from NJ Advance Media for comment on Lewis' claim. Lewis said she told friends about the encounter at the time. Josh Campbell, a fellow cast member who worked for six months on the show, confirmed the details of the incident, including that it happened in February at the Houston venue. He said Lewis told the cast \\"right afterwards\\" that Bush had groped her during the photo session at intermission. He also remembered the \\"silver fox\\" comment Bush made about the former first lady. \\"At the time, we all just kind of laughed about it,\\" he said, adding that he had heard \\"through the grapevine\\" that Bush had a habit of exhibiting this kind of behavior. Lewis, who has also appeared in the Broadway productions \\"Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark,\\" \\"If/Then\\" and \\"Grey Gardens,\\" said she was moved to go public after reading best-selling Montclair novelist Christina Baker Kline's essay for Slate in which she alleged similar behavior from Bush in 2014. She said she wanted to come forward with her story to support women who have shared their Bush experiences in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and other claims about alleged sexual assault and harassment in entertainment, media, sports and politics. Baker Kline had told NJ Advance Media that several women had contacted her after her essay was published, including one who said she witnessed similar behavior as a former employee of the Bushes. \\"This has been happening for decades,\\" Baker Kline said. Before Baker Kline came forward with her story on Oct. 26, and the Time story about Corrigan's claim was published on Nov. 13, four other women had made similar allegations against Bush. The first woman to speak out, actress Heather Lind, posted on Instagram Oct. 24 that Bush had grabbed her rear during a 2014 photo-op at a screening of her AMC show, \\"Turn: Washington's Spies.\\" \\"He didn't shake my hand,\\" she said. \\"He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke.\\" The second woman to make a claim, actress Jordana Grolnick, said that in summer of 2016, during a group photo op at a theater in Maine, where the Bushes summer, the former president made a joke as he allegedly grabbed her rear end. He said his favorite magician was \\"David Cop-a-feel,\\" in a nearly identical manner to the experience described in Baker Kline's essay (Bush allegedly asked if the author wanted to know his favorite book, but the \\"Cop-a-feel\\" answer was the same). Like Baker Kline and Corrigan, both Lind and Grolnick shared the photos they took with Bush. Each photo appears to show his hand reaching behind them in the area they describe. Two other women say Bush groped them before he used a wheelchair. Liz Allen, a former editor at the Erie Times-News in Erie, Pennsylvania, who recently won a city council seat there, said Bush touched her rear end in 2004, at a local business event. And Amanda Staples, a former Republican candidate for state Senate in Maine, said Bush groped her in 2006, when she was 29. She shared her own photo with the former president on Instagram. She says Bush delivered a different quip when he squeezed her rear end: \\"I'm not that president.\\" \\"I can only imagine how many women have had their butt grabbed in a photo op,\\" Staples said.

The NIV translation project began in the early 1960s, and it underwent multiple stages, revisions, and updates over the years. The process started in 1965 with the founding of the New York Bible Society International (now known as Biblica), which initiated the idea of creating a contemporary English translation of the Scripture. In order to achieve this goal, a group of Bible scholars and translators called the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT) was formed. The CBT consisted of more than 100 scholars from various denominations and backgrounds, including experts in biblical languages, theology, and communication. Early translation work began in the late 1960s, with the New Testament being completed first. The full Bible, including both the Old and New Testaments, was published in 1978. The translation process utilized the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts to produce an accurate and readable translation. The NIV Bible has gone through several updates over the years to incorporate the latest findings of biblical scholarship and to keep its language current. In 1984, the first major update was released, offering minor revisions to the initial translation. Following this, the NIV underwent a significant revision in 2005, resulting in the publication of the Today's New International Version (TNIV). The TNIV sought to provide a more accurate and gender-inclusive language, but it faced controversy and criticism due to some of its choices in translation. In response to these concerns, the CBT worked on another update that balanced the primary goals of the NIV - accuracy, clarity, and literary quality - while also addressing the feedback received from readers and scholars. This update, known as the NIV 2011, has become the standard edition in use today. In summary, the New International Version Bible's translation process started in the early 1960s, with the full Bible being published in 1978. Since then, it has undergone multiple revisions and updates, with the current edition (NIV 2011) standing as the most widely accepted version."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: where does google maps get its satellite images from?","completion":"To answer this question, I need to access my knowledge base, which contains information gathered from credible internet sources. So, let's proceed: Google Maps gets its satellite images from a variety of sources including government satellites and commercial satellites, and these come from both domestic and international sources. Google buys and licenses this data from these providers. Now, let's break it down: 1. Government imagery: Google sources some of its imagery data from government satellites. For example, in the United States, it gets data from US Geological Survey, NASA, and NOAA. 2. Commercial sources: Google additionally sources its imagery from commercial satellite providers like Maxar Technologies (previously DigitalGlobe), Planet Labs, and more. These companies have their own private imaging satellites that capture and sell high-resolution images of the earth. 3. International providers: Google also obtains imagery from international providers such as CNES/Airbus.

U.S. military considers its options in Syria Seven months ago, President Barack Obama warned the use of chemical weapons in Syria could bring direct U.S. involvement in that country's raging civil war. While the administration's interest in U.S. military involvement in Syria remains low, planners still have been preparing for the possibility U.S. forces would have to step in and neutralize Syria's military or safeguard chemical weapons stockpiles. It's not a pretty picture, NATO commander Adm. James Stavridis said Tuesday, a day after unconfirmed reports emerged that chemical weapons may have been used. \\"The Syrian situation continues to become worse and worse and worse,\\" he said. The mere possibility of U.S. involvement comes at a bad time for the military, which is preparing to ground some aircraft, scrap some naval deployments and cut back on training to meet budget cuts mandated by forced spending cuts that went into effect last month. Depending on what the administration might decide to do - and no decisions have yet been made to do anything - military intervention also could meet with resistance from a public weary of war after the long conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Several NATO countries are working on contingency plans for military action in Syria, including imposing a no-fly zone, providing lethal military assistance to rebel groups and imposing an arms embargo on the Syrian government, Stavridis said. NATO hasn't discussed any such options as a whole, he said. In Washington, military commanders continue to advocate strongly for a diplomatic solution rather than a military strike, a senior U.S. official said. The top U.S. military officer said this week that Syria poses the most complex set of issues he could conceive. \\"About six months ago we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition,\\" said Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \\"And now I would say it's even more opaque.\\" Dempsey has said he favored arming the rebels last year, when the Pentagon had discussions on the subject with the White House. But Obama decided to limit U.S. assistance to nonlethal aid, and Dempsey now seems more averse to arming groups that may be influenced by extremist elements. \\"I don't think at this point I can see a military option that would create an understandable outcome. And until I do, it would be my advice to proceed cautiously,\\" he said. Obama has not yet asked to see an action plan, senior military officials say. Here's a look at some of the options under consideration by NATO officials and Washington: NATO has installed Patriot missile batteries in Turkey, near its border with Syria, which could be aimed to shoot down Syrian aircraft, Stavridis said But Turkey only allowed the missile batteries to be placed there for defensive purposes, and NATO nations would have to agree before they could be used for offensive strikes against Syria. That's not something under immediate consideration, Stavridis said. The U.S. military has enough airpower in the region to take action against Syria, according to officials. That includes fighter jets and bombers spread out across air bases in the Middle East and nearby aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy also has warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies. But such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in Syria, the officials said. Other options include bombing runways to prevent Syrian aircraft from taking off, or disrupting communication between the regime leaders and ground commanders. The United States has no plans to put \\"boots on the ground\\" in Syria. But the Pentagon is a planning machine, so the Defense Department last year came up with a military analysis of a ground option should the president request it. According to the analysis, it would take up to 75,000 troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons facilities if they were in danger of being looted. An actual deployment would likely involve far fewer ground troops, and from various nations, but it underscores the scope of the challenge. Before ground troops would go in, weeks of airstrikes would be needed to destroy Syria's air defenses. The military believes Syria has about 50 weapon production sites around the country, as well as some storage areas and research centers.

No Reagan-style tax reform, please Andrew Fieldhouse is a federal budget policy analyst and John Irons is the research and policy director, both at the Economic Policy Institute. The opinions expressed are their own. This piece is part of an ongoing series on tax reform ideas. Where do you stand? Come back regularly to be a part of the national debate. We are overdue for tax reform. The tax code is outdated, unfair, unnecessarily complicated, and raises inadequate resources to meet national problems and priorities. Many observers envision tax reform modeled on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but the dual objectives of the ’86 reform—maintain the same overall level of revenue and the same distribution of the tax share across income levels—are inappropriate under current circumstances. Projected future deficits signal the need for more revenue, and growing income inequality signals the need to reexamine the fairness of the code. Properly designed tax reform could help tackle deficits and spur stronger economic growth while simplifying the code for individuals and businesses. The complexity of the code derives from a decades-long proliferation of tax code preferences, known as tax expenditures, which will lead to more than 1 trillion in lost revenue this year alone. Many of these tax expenditures, such as itemized deductions, are highly regressive because their value is larger for those in higher tax brackets and because they do not benefit tax filers claiming the standard deduction (typically lower-income workers). For example, the mortgage interest deduction — the second most costly expenditure — is worth 35 cents on the dollar to someone with an income of 1 million, but just 15 cents on the dollar to an itemizing married couple earning 60,000. It has no value at all for a family taking the standard deduction. Admittedly, abruptly wiping the slate clean of tax expenditures in order to broaden the base, lower rates and raise revenue seems unlikely politically and would remove some valuable incentives, such as those for charitable giving. A more plausible approach would be to cap the value of itemized deductions at a fixed flat rate, thereby leveling the playing field for average families in relation to upper-income individuals and limiting revenue loss. For example, limiting the benefit of itemizing deductions to 15% of their value would save 1.3 trillion over a decade. Certain deductions could then be converted to refundable tax credits that either benefit all filers or target a subset to better achieve policy objectives. The mortgage interest deduction could be converted to a flat refundable credit for interest on mortgages under500,000 (the current eligibility threshold is 1.1 million.)Particularly regressive and costly tax expenditures should be scrapped entirely. For example, the ’86 reform judiciously removed the preferentially low rates on capital gains and dividends. A 1986-style reform would lock in the current distribution of the tax burden, which reflects the regressive Bush-era tax changes that benefited upper-income and wealthier individuals. Instead of protecting the status quo, tax reform should improve fairness in the tax code and undo some of the tax cuts for high-income individuals. In an era of deficit and spending reductions, we should not cut taxes for those who least need a helping hand. The tax code can also be a key tool for poverty reduction, an important goal in a time when families are seeing their wages stagnate and their incomes fall. To tackle poverty, tax reform should include a permanent expansion of the earned income tax credit and an extension of the child tax credit to low-income families—two tax policies that increase the take-home pay for those hardest hit by the recession. Corporate tax reform is also needed, but politically difficult since corporations with a vested interest in the preference-laden status-quo are likely to throw their lobbying power against change. Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center notes that a few deeply entrenched preferences, including popular investment and research incentives, account for the overwhelming majority of corporate tax expenditures; relatively little low hanging fruit is there for the picking. Nevertheless, reform should address the imbalance between corporate and individual taxes—over the last half century, corporate income tax revenue as a share of the economy has plunged from 4.1% of gross domestic product in 1960 to just 1.3% of GDP and is projected to average only 2.0% over the next decade. Individual income and social insurance taxes, meanwhile, have risen from 10.6% of GDP in 1960 to 12.2% in 2010. Some policymakers say that we should use most or all of the revenue from loophole elimination to lower overall rates. However, at a time when core investments and priorities are being slashed from the budget but corporate profits are on the rise, why should we exempt corporations from their responsibilities? While curbing wasteful and regressive tax expenditures is a necessary first step, comprehensive tax reform will also require raising revenue from new sources, such as fees on the financial sector or revenues from efforts to combat global climate change. It has been 25 years since the last major tax reform effort; another overhaul is overdue. But times have changed,and we need to adjust our goals accordingly. Comprehensive tax reform should seek to raise more revenue, improve equity, and lay the foundation for stronger economic growth. Cleaning the tax code would free resources for deficit reduction, public investments, and other pro-growth tax incentives. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The tax code is overdue for reform, as it is outdated, unfair, and overly complicated, and raising inadequate resources to deal with national problems and priorities. However, a 1986-style reform would not be suitable for today's circumstances. Today, there is a need for more revenue due to projected future deficits, and growing income equality calls for a reevaluation of tax code fairness. A well-designed tax reform could address these issues while simplifying the tax code for individuals and businesses. Proposals for tax reform include capping itemized deductions at a fixed flat rate and converting some deductions to refundable tax credits. It is essential to address regressive and costly tax expenditures and to improve fairness in the tax code. Expanding the earned income tax credit and extending the child tax credit to low-income families would be crucial in tackling poverty. Corporate tax reform is also needed but faces political challenges. Comprehensive tax reform should focus on raising more revenue, improving equity, and promoting stronger economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises - Question: suppose more cars that run with electricity happens, how will it affect less heat radiation stays. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The widespread adoption of electric cars can potentially have a significant effect on reducing the trapped heat radiation in the Earth's atmosphere caused by human activities. If more cars that run on electricity are used, the burning of fossil fuels will decrease, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This in turn will lessen the amount of heat radiation trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As a result, there will be a more balanced heat radiation exchange between the Earth and space. By increasing the use of electric cars, we are effectively promoting a shift from fossil fuel-powered transportation to a more sustainable and clean energy source. Electricity can be generated from various renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which have considerably lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. This transition supports the goal of mitigating the effects of human-induced climate change by reducing our overall carbon footprint. Here is a more detailed breakdown of how the widespread adoption of electric cars might influence the reduction in trapped heat radiation: 1. Less combustion of fossil fuels: Conventional cars rely on combustion engines that burn fossil fuels to generate power, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Electric cars, on the other hand, do not require fuel combustion and produce zero direct tailpipe emissions. This shift reduces the overall greenhouse gas emissions responsible for trapping heat radiation. 2. Energy efficiency: Electric vehicles are generally more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. This means that electric cars can travel longer distances using less energy, reducing the total energy consumption and associated emissions. 3. Cleaner electricity generation: The environmental benefits of electric cars depend heavily on the sources of electricity utilized for charging. As the global shift towards cleaner and renewable energy sources continues, the carbon intensity of the electricity grid will decrease. This will result in even further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and, consequently, trapped heat radiation. 4. Indirect emissions reduction: Beyond the direct emissions reductions, electric cars can also contribute to indirect emissions reductions by helping to balance the electricity grid. By employing smart charging solutions and vehicle-to-grid technology, electric cars can store and release energy to the grid when needed, optimizing grid usage and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. In conclusion, the adoption of electric cars has the potential to reduce the trapped heat radiation by lowering greenhouse gas emissions arising from the burning of fossil fuels in transportation. The actual extent of this reduction might depend on various factors, such as the energy sources used for electricity generation and the pace of global transition to renewable energy sources. However, it is evident that electric vehicles can positively contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

George V will be crowned king on 22 June and in the preceding days many important dignitaries arrive. Among those arriving are the 16-year-old King Nicholas VIII of Carpathia, with his Prince Regent father, Charles (Laurence Olivier), a secondary Prince of Hungary and widower of the Queen of Carpathia. The British government realises that keeping Balkan country Carpathia in the Triple Entente is critical during the rising tensions in Europe. They find it necessary to pamper the royals during their stay in London, and thus civil servant Northbrook (Richard Wattis), is detached to their service. Northbrook decides to take the Prince Regent out to the musical performance The Coconut Girl. During the intermission the Prince Regent is taken backstage to meet the cast. He is particularly uninterested in engaging with the male actors and extremely interested in the physical charms of Elsie Marina (Marilyn Monroe), one of the performers, and sends a formal written invitation for her to meet him at the Carpathian embassy for supper. Elsie arrives at the embassy and is soon joined by the Prince Regent, a stiff and pompous man. She expects a large party but quickly realises the Prince's true intentions â to seduce her over a private supper. She is persuaded not to leave early by Northbrook, who promises to provide an excuse for her to escape after supper. The Prince Regent turns his back on her during the supper, taking phone calls and addressing matters of state. He then makes a clumsy pass at her, to which she is accustomed and immediately rebuffs. She pointedly explains how inept he is and that she had hoped the Prince was going to sway her with romance, passion and \\"gypsy violins\\".

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3.

Some learned to survive within her harsh burning grip. Some even learned to thrive in her, building stone monuments to themselves and living their lives surrounded in the lavish luxuries of Gods. How puny their monuments were compared to the desert herself. Where they had castles surrounded by dry moats, the desert had mountains surrounded by thousand year sandstorms. Where they had silks and the most beautiful slaves serving their every greatest desire, she had dunes that stretched for a thousand leagues and a sun that burned huge and deep crimson in the violet sky. Where desert kings, the Danken, dined on the finest food and drank the finest wine, the desert drank every drop of water from the air itself and feasted on men. Kadin knew the desert. He knew her voice whispering in the dark of night like a dangerous lover. The sound he heard now was not her voice but a cry from one trapped within the desert's teeth. It was the cry of a woman. Kadin rose from his makeshift bed in the dip of two dunes. He stood quickly, tying the leather straps of his knife belt around his waist. He pulled on his boots and silently mounted White Ash. THe mare felt his soft touch and made no sound. Kadin listened and heard the cry again. He studied the dunes in the darkness of night. THe blood moon painted the desert a deep red.

Write an article based on this summary: – Washington state is cracking down on texting and eating at the wheel with a new law that went into effect Sunday. The new “Driving Under the Influence of Electronics” law puts stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in cars, reports the Seattle Times. Even when stopped at a red light or in standstill traffic, drivers can be ticketed for simply holding their phones. The law allows phone usage strictly in emergency situations or with apps that are voice-activated, controlled through dashboards, or mounted for map navigation that requires “minimal use” of fingers. Per USA Today, offenders will be slapped with a 136 fine for first offenses; the penalty increases to 234 for additional offenses within five years. Police will report offenses to insurance companies and they’ll also appear on driving records. Non-electronic distractions like applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap are also restricted as a secondary offense and run a 99 fine. “If I see you speeding and as you speed by me, I see that you're eating a big old cheeseburger, that's a secondary,” Washington State Patrol trooper Will Finn explained to Fox 12 during a ride along, during which he pulled over a driver (who was “shocked” to find out about the law) for speeding while eating an ice cream cone. Finn added that educating drivers is key in the first stages of the law to get to Washington’s Traffic Safety Commission’s \\"Target Zero\\" goal of no deaths on the road by 2030. Per the Times, distracted driving causes a third of road deaths. A spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association says Washington, the first state to ban texting while driving 10 years ago, \\"has the potential to be a game changer and serve as a model for other states.\\"","completion":"Title: Washington State Enforces \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" Law to Combat Distracted Driving As of Sunday, Washington state has implemented stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices while driving with the introduction of the new \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" law. The law, which aims to reduce distracted driving, will prohibit drivers from using handheld electronic devices even when their vehicle is stopped, such as at red lights or in standstill traffic. Drivers caught using electronic devices in non-emergency situations or without voice-activated apps, dashboard controls, or mounted map navigation systems could face significant fines. The penalties for breaking the new law are severe. According to USA Today, first-time offenders will be charged a 136 fine, with the penalty increasing to 234 for further offenses within five years. Additionally, police will report the offense to insurance companies, and it will appear on the driver's record. The law also covers non-electronic distractions, such as applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap, classified as secondary offenses and carrying a 99 fine. Washington State Patrol trooper Will Finn explained the importance of educating drivers about the new law to Fox 12, stating that raising awareness is crucial in the initial stages of enforcing the restrictions. The introduction of the law is part of Washington’s Traffic Safety Commission's \\"Target Zero\\" initiative, which aims to eliminate road fatalities by 2030. According to the Seattle Times, distracted driving accounts for one-third of all road deaths. Washington state has a history of leading the nation in addressing the issue of distracted driving, as it was the first state to ban texting while driving ten years ago. A spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association commented that Washington's actions could potentially serve as a model for other states looking to tackle the dangers of distracted driving.

The dictionary and its style guide would make Mrs. Grundy proud. Sentence 2: Mrs. Grundy would hate the dictionary and its style guide. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand why, we first need to clarify what entailment means in the context of logic and linguistic semantics. Entailment is a relationship between two statements where if the first statement is true, the second statement must also necessarily be true. However, the reverse is not always the case. In the given pair of sentences, the first statement says that the Microsoft product, the new Encarta Dictionary, and its style guide are of a quality or characteristic that would make Mrs. Grundy proud. It establishes a positive connection between Mrs. Grundy and the referenced dictionary. However, the second sentence directly contradicts the sentiment expressed in the first one, stating that Mrs. Grundy would hate the dictionary and its style guide. This is a complete reversal of the positive association made in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is not following logically from the first one, or '\\"entailed\\" by the first sentence. If the first sentence proposes that Mrs. Grundy would be proud of the dictionary, it cannot also be true that she would hate it, especially given no changes or new information has been introduced between the two sentences. Consequently, in context of these two statements, they present opposing views and the second is not a logical consequence or entailment of the first. To have an entailment, the second sentence should be something like \\"Mrs. Grundy would appreciate the dictionary and its style guide,\\" which maintains the positive sentiment of the first sentence and logically follows from it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Deep breathing is a great exercise to make use of when you’re feeling rage. It allows you to slow down and regain control of your thoughts and emotions as well as the situation itself. Do several cycles of deep breathing until you feel calmer. Try pulling in deep breaths from your diaphragm. Inhale and watch your belly expand. Exhale and watch it deflate. With each inhale, imagine yourself being filled with calm energy. With each exhale, envision the rage being expelled from your body. Rage can cause extreme physical tension in your body, which can actually lead to injury. Progressive muscle relaxation is a useful exercise for easing this tension. Take deep, calming breaths. Start at your toes and work your way up through your body, gradually contracting and relaxing each muscle group. For instance, you might tense your toes up and notice what that feels like for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and notice what that feels like before moving to a new muscle group. This technique also helps you become more aware of the experience of holding tension in your body. In the future, when you feel that tension, you’ll know how to relax your muscles. Aggressive actions like punching, throwing something, or yelling don’t always lead to catharsis. Why? Because you haven’t actually addressed the thing that’s making you feel enraged. Writing in a journal is one of the best ways to do this. Start a rage journal in which you regularly jot down all the people or situations that rub you the wrong way. Describe everything in as much detail as you can. Once you’ve let off some steam, go back and re-read what you wrote. You might decide to go ahead and rip the paper to pieces. You might also decide to brainstorm some ways to actively problem-solve the situations that make you so angry.","completion":"Deep breathing is an effective exercise to manage rage, helping you regain control of thoughts and emotions.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths.

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what were frederick douglass achievements?\\" Answer:","completion":"Frederick Douglass was an African American abolitionist, writer, orator, and social reformer who made significant contributions to both the abolitionist and civil rights movements. Born into slavery in Maryland in 1818, he managed to escape and eventually became a leading figure in the fight against slavery and for equal rights for African Americans and women. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Escaped slavery: In 1838, at the age of 20, Douglass escaped from his life of bondage disguised as a free Black sailor with borrowed identification papers. This was a daring and risky undertaking that would pave the way for his future activism and leadership. 2. Abolitionist leader: Douglass became an influential leader in the abolitionist movement, which sought to end the institution of slavery in the United States. He actively spoke out against slavery at various public meetings and was renowned for his eloquent speeches. 3. Writer and publisher: Douglass published numerous works advocating for the abolition of slavery and equal rights for African Americans. His autobiography, \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\\" published in 1845, is considered a seminal work in African American literature. This account of his life became a bestseller and helped to generate support for the abolitionist cause. Douglass also established the influential newspapers \\"The North Star\\" (1847), \\"Frederick Douglass' Paper\\" (1851), and \\"Douglass' Monthly\\" (1858) to spread the message of abolition and equal rights. 4. Women's rights advocate: Douglass supported the women's suffrage movement and was one of the few men to attend the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention. He co-authored the convention's \\"Declaration of Sentiments\\" and supported the right of women to vote throughout his life. 5. Underground Railroad: Douglass provided assistance and shelter to many escaped slaves as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. He also helped to raise funds for the movement, enabling the escape and relocation of countless individuals seeking freedom from bondage. 6. Civil War recruiter: During the Civil War, Douglass recruited African American soldiers to fight for the Union, including his own sons. He met with President Abraham Lincoln to advise him on issues related to the treatment of African American soldiers and post-war policies aimed at achieving equality for freed slaves. 7. Government appointments: After the Civil War, Douglass held several important government positions, such as president of the Freedman's Savings Bank, which aimed to assist emancipated African Americans with economic stability, and the charge d'affaires for the Dominican Republic. In 1877, he was appointed a U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia. Furthermore, he became the U.S. ambassador to Haiti in 1889, where he served until 1891. 8. Civil rights activism: Throughout his life, Douglass continued to fight for civil rights for African Americans, working tirelessly to promote social justice and equality. One example is his fervent support of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted citizenship to former slaves and African American men's right to vote. In conclusion, Frederick Douglass was a remarkable individual whose achievements spanned numerous domains, including abolition, civil rights, suffrage, and diplomacy. His life and work remain a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the ongoing struggle for justice and equality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

A:","completion":"Lisa B: Beth A detailed answer to this question based on the given paragraph: Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Lisa was diagnosed with cancer, while her sister Beth was not. Cancer is a condition where abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and spread throughout the body, forming malignant tumors or disrupting the function of healthy tissues. Since Lisa was the one diagnosed with cancer, she had more abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably in her body. On the other hand, Beth did not have a cancer diagnosis, which means that she had fewer or no abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably in contrast to her sister. While it cannot be determined whether Beth had any abnormal cell activity at all, it is evident that she had fewer abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably compared to Lisa.

Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage. You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Input: Passage: Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \\"unit\\".

Usage: The passage is about the history of considering '1' as a prime number in mathematics. It describes how early Greeks didn't consider 1 as a number or prime, how during the Middle Ages and Renaissance it was considered a prime, and how in the early 20th century mathematicians started to accept that 1 is not a prime but a \\"unit\\". This meets the criteria of understanding the passage because it accurately describes the main points discussed. Part #2: Understand the given question. Usage: The question asks about the number of primes included in the early Greek's list of prime numbers. This meets the criteria of understanding the question because it accurately describes what information is being asked for. Part #3: Determine if the question can be answered with the passage. Usage: The passage states that early Greeks did not consider 1 to be a number or prime. However, it doesn't provide any specific information about how many primes were included in the early Greek's list of prime numbers, so the question can't be answered with the information given in the passage. This meets the criteria of determining answerability because it correctly identifies that the passage lacks information needed to answer the question.

Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

It specifically mentions that she is very kind, and this is the primary reason that all of her patients like her very much. The other options such as \\"Because she is very had\\" (which seems to be a typo and does not make sense) or \\"Because she is serious\\" do not accurately describe the reason why her patients like her. Additionally, the option \\"Because she is their aunt\\" is incorrect, as the article does not mention any familial relationships between Mary and her patients. Mary's kindness is further demonstrated through her actions in the story. When she sees an old woman, Mrs. Herman, waiting to cross a busy street, Mary goes out of her way to help her. Upon recognizing Mrs. Herman as one of her former patients, Mary kindly addresses her and assists her by ensuring that they only cross the street when it is safe to do so.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It might not seem like a big deal to you when she compliments your new sneakers, but her noticing changes in your outfit or appearance and complimenting you could be her way of showing you she's interested enough in you to pay attention. Many shy people are worried about saying the wrong thing, which sometimes leads to quietness around a crush. Oppositely, nervousness at being close to a crush might cause a shy girl to be a little more chatty. In either case, research has shown that if she responds to you smoothly and quickly, she likely is interested in some kind of relationship with you. Small praise has a profound effect on people, but this effect is more pronounced with potential romantic partners. Does your girl light up when you pay her simple praise? She may be crushing on you. When she peppers your conversation with pleasant laughter at your wit and charm, it could mean she wants you to like her. Listen for frequency. Laughing more with you than others could be a love letter from her subconscious. Notes in lower registers are subconscious attempts at showing off, which makes a dreamy or husky quality in her voice a good sign for you! She may be loud around others, but quiet around you. These are often hints she is interested. Shy people frequently fear direct confrontation, so asking her if she has feelings for you through a note passed on through a friend or in a message that friend relates to her could save you from unnecessary detective work. Remember, she will find out that you asked, and sometimes people use this information to pick on other. There is nothing wrong with asking someone if they like you.

However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: \\"Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.\\" The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson states about a character who was misunderstood, \\"when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice,\\" to which he responds, \\"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\\"\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The answer is Scout. The context given mentions Robinson and Scout. Robinson is mentioned as a surname, specifically for a character named Tom Robinson. However, Scout is referred to as a first name in the context. This is clear when Atticus addresses Scout directly, verifying that it's a first name rather than a last name. Therefore, Scout is not a last name in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

If People were always aware of the issue [of gender], but I was never denied an opportunity., can we conclude that \\"Opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone.\\"?","completion":"In order to address the conclusion that \\"Opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone\\" based on the premise that one individual was always aware of the issue of gender and was never personally denied an opportunity, we must examine various factors that contribute to gender-related opportunities and discrimination. First, it is important to remember that individual experiences are not universal. Just because one person has not encountered a particular challenge, that does not mean it does not exist for others. In this specific case, the individual's experience of never being denied an opportunity due to their gender is a valuable perspective, but it cannot be exclusively used to draw conclusions about the experiences and opportunities of others on a larger scale. Second, we should consider the role of privilege and the various intersecting factors that might contribute to the individual not experiencing gender-based discrimination, such as race, socio-economic status, location, age, and educational background. These factors can influence the presence or absence of discrimination in an individual's life and consequently shape their experiences and opportunities differently. Third, the broader societal and institutional structures must be taken into account when discussing gender-based discrimination and opportunities. For example, the gender pay gap persists across multiple industries, whereby women consistently earn less than men for the same work. Additionally, women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions and certain fields, such as technology and engineering. These structural inequalities can negatively impact opportunities for certain individuals based on their gender. When we analyze the available evidence and the complexities of contemporary society, it becomes clear that the conclusion that \\"opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone\\" is not an accurate representation of the reality faced by many individuals across the globe. Although the person in question has not experienced gender-based discrimination directly, this unfortunately does not negate the fact that it exists for a significant number of others. To conclude, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of drawing upon solely personal experiences for understanding broader social issues. While one individual's experience can be an important perspective, it should not be generalized to represent the realities and challenges faced by others. In order to accurately assess the role of gender in determining opportunities, we must continue to examine systemic inequalities, privileges, and intersecting factors that come into play across different contexts and populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

A:","completion":"Ivo Andrić was born first compared to Peter Ackroyd. In order to better understand the context surrounding the lives of these two prominent writers, let's take a closer look at their biographical information. Ivo Andrić was born on October 9, 1892, in Dolac, a village in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now located within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He was a Yugoslav writer and a key figure in the literary movement of the South Slavic regions, known for his novels, short stories, essays, and poetry. He gained international recognition when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961 for his novel \\"The Bridge on the Drina.\\" Andrić's work often revolves around the culture, history, and identity of the South Slavic peoples and captures the essence of life in the Balkans. On the other hand, Peter Ackroyd was born on October 5, 1949, in London, England. He is a distinguished English biographer, historian, and novelist known for his detailed literary style and vivid exploration of history, particularly that of England and particularly focusing on the city of London. Some of his most notable works include \\"Hawksmoor\\", \\"London: The Biography\\", and \\"The Life of Thomas More.\\" Of note is the fact that Ackroyd has not just been limited to the written word, but has also been involved in television productions that delve into the history and character of his home country. There is a significant difference in their birth years, with Andrić being born 57 years before Ackroyd. Consequently, it is quite clear that Ivo Andrić was born first, well before Peter Ackroyd entered the world and began making his own mark in literary history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Giggs was granted the injunction in April 2011 after a 14 April article in the Sun on an unnamed player's alleged affair with model Imogen Thomas. Despite the order, Mr Giggs was widely identified. The High Court heard that he had now consented to being named. It is considering whether he can sue the Sun for alleged breach of privacy. Mr Giggs had been granted an injunction on the basis that TV presenter Ms Thomas appeared to have been trying to blackmail him. However, the 2003 Miss Wales and former Big Brother contestant took legal action against him and, in December 2011, Mr Giggs accepted that she had not been blackmailing him. In court on Tuesday, Mr Giggs's lawyer - Hugh Tomlinson QC - said the injunction that had been supposed to stop his client being identified as the subject of the Sun's story had been breached by thousands of people on the internet. Mr Tomlinson said there had been \\"large scale and continued breaches of the order by a number of malign individuals\\" who had put his client's name in the public domain. Mr Giggs, a former Welsh international who has played for Manchester United for 20 years, was widely identified on social networking sites and in a Scottish newspaper. In May, Lib Dem MP John Hemming also named Mr Giggs during an urgent Commons question on privacy orders. Using parliamentary privilege to break the court order, he said it would not be practical to imprison the 75,000 Twitter users who had named the player. Mr Tomlinson said his client was claiming damages from the Sun for the subsequent re-publication of information in other newspapers and on the internet. \\"He has suffered damage and distress by the chain of events that has been set off by the publication of the article in the Sun,\\" he said. \\"We say the printing of information on the front page of a national newspaper can give rise to an action for misuse of private information.\\" Mr Tomlinson said the Sun article had \\"generated a large media storm\\" and that the damages claim was about \\"providing effective protection\\" for Mr Giggs's right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights. For News Group Newspapers - which publishes the Sun - Richard Spearman QC said the newspaper had behaved \\"entirely properly\\". He said the original account of the affair published in the Sun was an \\"extremely generalized and anodyne\\" account. \\"We didn't identify him. We didn't intend to identify him,\\" he said. \\"On the damages for publication, it is dead in the water, this case.\\" Mr Spearman said the Sun had informed Mr Giggs about the article before it was published, giving him an opportunity to seek an injunction. He said legal action had been \\"spun along for a long, long time\\", but Mr Tomlinson said that allegation was \\"wholly without foundation\\". After hearing legal arguments at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Tugendhat reserved his decision on whether the case should go to trial.

Options: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","completion":"Based on the premise \\"I heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad,\\" it is not possible to tell whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I heard that the flooding was bad.\\" Therefore, the answer is option b). To explain this in more detail, the premise mentions the presence of rain in a particular area, but it does not provide concrete information about the impact, severity, or duration of the rainfall. The phrase \\"it's really been that bad\\" does not specifically reference flooding, making it difficult to discern whether the situation has indeed led to drastic consequences such as severe flooding. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses on flooding, which is a possible outcome of heavy or prolonged rainfall. However, it is important to note that not all instances of rainfall result in severe flooding. A variety of factors may influence the likelihood and severity of flooding, such as the area's landscape, drainage systems, and the amount of rainfall over time. In this case, since the premise does not provide enough information about the direct impacts of the rain on the area or the severity of the resulting flooding, it is not possible to confirm the hypothesis solely based on the given premise.

A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings.

However, if you are traveling overseas, it is essential to find out if your current health insurance policy provides coverage for medical expenses incurred outside of the United States. Medicare and many major carriers don't typically cover medical expenses in foreign countries, so you might need additional travel insurance to protect yourself financially in case of a medical emergency or any other travel-related mishap. There are several factors that you should take into consideration when determining if you need travel insurance. Some of these factors include: 1. Destination: Countries with high healthcare costs or where your existing insurance coverage is limited may require additional travel insurance. 2. Duration of the trip: Longer trips involve higher risks, so you might need extra coverage to protect yourself in case something goes wrong. 3. Age and health: Older travelers or those with pre-existing medical conditions might need to purchase additional travel insurance to cover expenses related to their health needs. 4. Activities: If you plan on participating in adventure sports or other high-risk activities, it is essential to have additional insurance coverage in case of injury or accidents. 5. Risks and uncertainties: Things like trip cancellations, lost luggage, or travel delays might make travel insurance a wise investment to protect your financial interests. You can obtain travel insurance through various sources, such as travel agents, insurance brokers, or specialized travel insurance providers. It is important to shop around, compare quotes, and read the fine print to ensure that you are getting the coverage you need at the best price possible. If you are unsure about your existing health insurance coverage or need assistance finding travel insurance, contacting your health insurance provider or visiting their website is a great first step. For Medicare beneficiaries, the official Medicare website (https://www.medicare.gov/) or the toll-free line at 1-800-633-4227 (1-800-MEDICARE) can provide valuable information and assistance. Ultimately, determining whether you need travel insurance involves carefully weighing the risks and potential costs associated with your trip. In many cases, having travel insurance can provide peace of mind, financial protection, and valuable support during your travels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The news has left the motorsports community in mourning for a man whose dedication and support helped shape a world champion. **A Devastating Loss:** A statement released by Jenson Button's agent confirmed the tragic news and expressed that the driver was 'devastated' by the loss of his father. John Button was an instrumental figure in Jenson's rise to Formula 1 stardom, using his own background in motorsports to guide and mentor his son from an early age. **The Guiding Force Behind Jenson Button's F1 Career:** John Button, himself a former rallycross driver, recognized his son's potential and relentless determination when Jenson took up kart racing as a child. Demonstrating unwavering support, he set up a go-kart business to provide Jenson with the necessary resources to pursue his passion. The business venture helped fund Jenson's foray into the world of competitive motorsports, paving the way for his son to secure a prestigious seat in the elite Formula 1 racing competition. Jenson would later repay that investment and trust by accumulating 15 Grand Prix wins and a World Championship title to his name. **A Family in Mourning:** Alongside Jenson, John is survived by his three daughters, Natasha, Samantha, and Tanya. The Button family is united in mourning the loss of a beloved father, whose commitment to nurturing Jenson's dreams led to the realization of a remarkable and unforgettable career. **Conclusion:** As the motorsports community comes to terms with the passing of John Button, we are reminded of the pivotal role that dedicated parents and mentors can play in fostering the talents, aspirations, and achievements of the younger generation.

Step 2: Introduce characters and their relationships - Calvera (Eli Wallach): The ruthless and cunning leader of the bandits, who is feared by everyone, even his own gang members. He is a charming but cruel man, with a sense of humor that borders on sadistic. - Sheriff Johnson: The town's new sheriff, who has recently moved from the East Coast with his family. He is a man of strong morals and values, who wants to bring law and order to this lawless area. - Maria: The daughter of a local mine owner, she is strong-willed, independent, and a skilled horse rider.

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style.

Article: There are lots of dangerous and terrible insects in Northeastern India, but the tree-bees are the most terrible. They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? - Cave paintings are beautiful. - Who found the beautiful cave paintings. - The Lascanx caves hold ancient colorful paintings. - Drawings of horses are on the walls of the Lascaux caves. Answer:","completion":"The main idea of the passage is that the Lascaux caves hold ancient colorful paintings created by Cro-Magnon people. The article provides a detailed description of the paintings, explains their age and backgrounds, and speculates about why these ancient artists created the drawings on cave walls. The discovery of these paintings by four French boys in 1940 also serves as an interesting anecdote to introduce the topic, which further reinforces the significance of these caves and their artwork."},{"prompt":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Article: August has always been difficult for me. It is the time when I realize that the books my English teacher assigned to me are not going to read themselves and that I have a difficult month in front of me. You might think that I don't want to spend my summer reading, but that's not the problem: I love reading. On the first day of my summer holidays this year, I went to the library and got \\"A Gathering of Old Men\\" by African-American writer Ernest Gaines. I enjoyed it very much. I read all the magazines that my parents subscribe to and spend about 30 minutes every day with the morning paper. So why do I hate summer reading for school? Because the books on summer reading lists are often slow-going and just uninviting. Teachers and librarians don't understand that summer reading can be entertaining as well as educational. They choose books that a friend of my mother's calls \\"spinach books\\": good for you, but not much fun to take in. Every summer, I read them, hate them and get bitter about the experience. This bitterness started three years ago when I was about to begin high school. As preparation, my English teacher told me to read \\"The Age of Innocence\\" by American author Edith Wharton. I'm sure there are many people who enjoyed \\"The Age of Innocence\\"--some might even say it's their favorite book. But I don't think any of these people read it as a 14-year-old boy on his summer vacation. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" is the story of a forbidden romance in prefix = st1 /New York100 years ago. At 14, my only experience with romance was my love for baseball. I couldn't imagine being in love, much less being in love in 1900. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" was totally different to my life. Most of my required summer reading has been like that--books written in a style that plays up the adjectives and plays down the verbs. I guess teachers don't think exciting plots make for \\"good literature\\". To me, though, a good writer describes events and characters in a way that makes the reader want to know what happens next.

Pick from: a). Yes; b). It's impossible to say; c). No; Hypothesis: No vessels are renamed after capture.","completion":"c). No; The hypothesis stating that no vessels are renamed after capture is incorrect based on the information provided in the paragraph. According to the details mentioned, the HMS \\"West Florida\\" underwent a name change to Gálveztown after being captured by the USS \\"Morris\\" during the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain. It is essential to consider historical records of naval actions to understand that this was a common practice in those times. When a ship was captured by an adversary during a naval battle or skirmish, it was customary for the victorious party to claim the vessel as a prize and incorporate it into their naval fleet. This practice allowed the victor to strengthen its naval force and undermine the enemy in terms of resources. Renaming a captured ship after the battle was a way to claim the ship as one's own and assign it a place in the new navy's fleet, establishing this vessel as reborn under a different flag and allegiance. In the case of the HMS \\"West Florida\\", which was captured by the Continental Navy's USS \\"Morris\\" during the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain, renaming the vessel Gálveztown served more than one purpose. First, it was an acknowledgment of the ship's capture and its subsequent incorporation into the winning side's fleet. Second, Gálveztown was also named supposedly in honor of Bernardo de Gálvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana during that period. This act of renaming could have been done to recognize and commemorate the contributions of Gálvez and his role in supporting the fight against the British. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that no vessels are renamed after capture does not hold true, as the example provided in the paragraph clearly illustrates the renaming of the HMS \\"West Florida\\" after its capture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its provisions are reflected in Article 29. There was a binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory: the Federal Territory must be revised ... (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least one tenth of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then a referendum was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3).

The band became closely linked to the burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement of the early 1980s, and are best known for their hit \\"Fade to Grey\\" which was released in late 1980. In the UK, the band achieved two Top 20 albums (Visage and The Anvil) and five Top 30 singles before the commercial failure of their third album (Beat Boy) led to their break-up in 1985. The band has seen various line-up changes over the years, all fronted by vocalist Steve Strange, who resurrected the band name in the 2000s. Steve Strange reappeared on the music scene in 2002, after several years of battling a heroin addiction and other personal problems. He performed several Visage songs on the Here and Now Xmas Tour - a revival of 1980s pop acts. Some time after the performance, Strange decided to create a \\"Mark II\\" of Visage with people from several electronic bands and projects: Steven Young, Sandrine Gouriou and Rosie Harris from Seize and Ross Tregenza from Jetstream Lovers/Goteki. After the announcement of the formation of the new line-up and several television appearances, plans for reworking old material and releasing a new record made slow progress. An updated version of \\"Fade to Grey\\" was produced in 2005. In 2006, Strange also collaborated with the electronic duo Punx Soundcheck and provided vocals on the track \\"In the Dark\\", which was included on the duo's debut double album When Machines Ruled the World. The first Visage mk II track was released in 2007, entitled \\"Diary of a Madman\\". Written by Strange with Visage mk II member Ross Tregenza, the track was co-produced by original Visage member Dave Formula. This song was made available for download from their official website in return for a donation to the charity Children in Need. However, no further new material surfaced from this line-up. The long-since deleted Visage VHS video collection was repackaged for release on DVD in Summer 2006, though it was mistakenly titled Visage Live. In 2008, Strange (and Visage II keyboardist Sandrine Gouriou) made an appearance in the BBC drama series Ashes to Ashes which is set in 1981. In it, they performed the song \\"Fade to Grey\\" in a scene set in the \\"Blitz\\" nightclub. In 2009, Strange and Egan appeared in Living TV's Pop Goes the Band, a series in which pop stars from the 1980s are given a complete makeover in return for a one-off performance. The Visage episode aired on 16 March 2009, and was the first time that the two men had spoken in over 20 years. The episode focused (like others in the series) more on getting them fit in the gym than on the current state of their relationship, though they appeared to get on well enough. At the culmination of the episode, they performed \\"Fade to Grey\\". In 2010, new remixes of \\"Fade to Grey\\" were produced by club DJs Michael Gray and Lee Mortimer to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the song.

Objective: how to make an easy dressing for fruit salad Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Since you provided no solutions to compare, I will first outline a simple fruit salad dressing recipe and explain it step by step using naive physics reasoning. This will help you understand how to make it and the process behind the recipe. Step 1: Gather the ingredients To follow naive physics reasoning, we need to start by gathering the ingredients required for making a fruit salad dressing. We'll need some citrus, such as lemon or lime juice, a sweetener like honey or sugar, and optionally, a little vanilla extract or cinnamon for extra flavor. Step 2: Measure the ingredients With the ingredients in hand, we need to measure them to create the right balance of flavors. Here's a suggested ratio: - 1/4 cup of citrus juice (lemon or lime) - 2 tablespoons of sweetener (honey or sugar) - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional) - 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional) Step 3: Combining the ingredients Now we need to combine the ingredients in a way that ensures equal distribution of flavors throughout the dressing. Since liquids (like citrus juice) can mix with other liquids (like honey) easily, we can use a whisk to mix the ingredients in a bowl. Step 4: Adjust the sweetness or acidity Taste the dressing and adjust the sweetness or acidity if needed, by adding more honey or citrus juice. This conforms to our naive physics reasoning that teaches us that the dressing's flavor profile can be adjusted through the addition of more ingredients. Step 5: Pour the dressing over the fruit salad Finally, pour the dressing over your prepared fruit salad, ensuring even coverage. The logic behind this is that every fruit piece should be coated with the dressing to enhance its flavor. In conclusion, using naive physics reasoning, making an easy fruit salad dressing involves gathering the ingredients, measuring and mixing them, adjusting for taste, and finally, pouring it over the fruit salad for an enhanced flavor profile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A High Court judge awarded the payout to Catherine Rooney after deciding that cleaning the cup fell within regulations on work equipment. Mrs Rooney had been washing up in the kitchen area at Anne's Primary School, Londonderry, in March 2011. The court heard that the handle on a mug broke off and sliced into her lower arm, damaging a tendon. She later underwent surgery on her injuries at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and was off work for about a year. She had taken off her gloves while drying the crockery. In her action against the Western Education and Library Board it was accepted that her induction training did not include using gloves while drying items. The claim centred on whether Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 applied to her case. Mrs Rooney's lawyers argued that a cup does constitute equipment, while the defendant contended that it did not come within a list of work tools. Ruling on the action, the judge held that pots, pans, cups and glasses being used to provide food and drink at the school fell within the regulations. \\"This plaintiff cleaning the cup in question was using it, as part of the equipment of the kitchen as it had become, in her capacity as an employee of the defendant at her work,\\" he said.

Part #4: Create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: Were there no concerns among Tajik officials about Islamic militarism in the west of the country in 2010?

Europeans, as well as Russia and the United States, sold almost any type of weapons to them. In this statement, the author is highlighting the involvement of various powerful countries in supporting autocratic governments around the world. One of the primary ways this support manifested was through the sale of weapons and military equipment. The European countries, along with Russia and the United States, have been major suppliers of arms to these autocracies, essentially helping them maintain their hold on power. These countries provided a wide range of weapons, from small arms and ammunition to more specialized and advanced systems like tanks, aircraft, and missile systems. These sales not only enabled the autocracies to maintain their grip on power by suppressing opposition and controlling their populations, but also often led to human rights abuses and armed conflicts in various regions. The role of these nations in providing arms to autocratic governments has raised some ethical questions, as well. On one hand, it can be argued that supporting autocracies for political or economic reasons is a necessary part of international relations, especially given the complex web of alliances and interests that make up the global landscape. On the other hand, critics argue that enabling autocracies through arms sales and other forms of support indirectly contributes to human rights abuses, ongoing conflicts, and general instability in the affected regions. Additionally, there is the potential for these weapons to end up in the hands of extremist or terrorist groups, further exacerbating the problem. In conclusion, supporting autocratic governments through the sale of weapons presents an ethical dilemma for powerful nations like the European countries, Russia, and the United States. While it may be inevitable within the complex realm of international relations, the implications of such support are far-reaching and have the potential to cause harm, particularly in terms of human rights abuses and prolonged conflicts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \\"activity\\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics , strength building, and flexibility exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day. On days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day. Just as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes.

Fox, a renowned Canadian-American actor, author, comedian, and advocate, is living with Parkinson's disease, a long-term degenerative disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. Fox first publicly disclosed his condition in 1998, although he was diagnosed in 1991 at the age of 29. Parkinson's disease develops due to the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a region in the brain that produces the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine plays a vital role in transmitting signals in the brain that control body movement, coordination, and balance. As dopamine levels decrease, individuals with Parkinson's may experience a range of symptoms that worsen over time. The primary motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease include: 1. Tremors: Involuntary shaking, usually starting in the hands and fingers, and eventually involving the arms, legs, and feet. 2. Rigidity: Stiffness or inflexibility in the muscles, impeding smooth movement and causing discomfort. 3. Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement and difficulty initiating voluntary movement, with the overall reduction of mobility and delayed response in daily tasks. 4. Postural instability: Impaired balance, which can lead to difficulty standing straight, falls, and loss of reflexes designed to maintain posture. Parkinson's disease can also present a range of non-motor symptoms such as: 1. Cognitive decline: Difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function, which may progress to dementia in later stages. 2. Mood disorders: Patients can experience depression, anxiety, irritability, and apathy. 3. Sleep disorders: Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, wherein individuals act out their dreams, potentially causing injury. 4. Autonomic dysfunction: This can involve constipation, urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), and sexual dysfunction. 5. Sensory abnormalities: Issues with smell, vision, pain, and other sensory disturbances may be present in Parkinson's disease. In an effort to raise awareness and support related research, Michael J.

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history. Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their \\"lucky\\" yellow and blue strip, which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

Entailment in linguistics is the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one (Sentence A) necessitates the truth of the other (Sentence B). Here, Sentence 1 states: 'Uh oh.'

There is no entailment between these two sentences because the action in Sentence 2 (ignoring White) does not necessarily follow from the action in Sentence 1 (tapping White on the shoulder). In fact, they depict contrasting behaviors. One could argue that tapping someone on the shoulder is an act of getting someone's attention rather than ignoring them.

The Ulster Gazette's front page is dedicated to schoolboy John Joe Toner, who died from a suspected heart condition. The 11-year-old died five days after collapsing in school and the paper said the village of Clady \\"came to a standstill for one of its darkest days\\". The chapel was \\"packed to overflowing\\" and mourners heard his death was a \\"terrible tragedy for the whole community\\". The border is the main concern for the Fermanagh Herald. It says officials in the Republic of Ireland are already identifying sites along the county's border to locate post-Brexit checkpoints. The paper says while the checkpoints will initially involve stops on commercial vehicles on main roads, the suggestion of cameras being placed \\"on the dozens of country roads criss-crossing the border\\" is causing local concern. But all the talk of the town has been that fiver - the one engraved with the tiny Jane Austen picture and worth an estimated £50,000. Four new plastic notes were engraved by artist Graham Short and spent in each of the home countries last year. And it turns out the artist had spent one of them in Charlie's Bar in Enniskillen. It was found by a County Donegal woman who returned it to the Scottish gallery it came from, saying she wanted any money raised from its sale to be used to help young people. Charlie's owner Gerry Burns said there had been \\"some craic in the bar\\" since the news got out. The Herald says many locals are \\"kicking themselves\\" for not examining their cash more thoroughly. In case you wondered, Mr Short bought a pint of Guinness in the bar. The Newry Reporter carries an exclusive on its front page - train services to and from Newry rail station will increase from this summer. It says additional early morning and late night services to and from Belfast are to be introduced on weekdays, with extra trains also planned for Saturdays. Elsewhere in the city, Newry Leisure Centre was forced to close its doors three times in the space of just 10 days, the paper reveals. It lists the reasons as a hydraulic acid spill in the plant room, a burst water pipe, and a more human error - nobody who had a key was available to open the centre. With a week to go, there are eight pages of election coverage in the Reporter, including in-depth interviews with many of the party leaders. In County Antrim, the Ulster Star leads with concerns over scrambler safety following the death of a man in a crash at Sprucefield. Lisburn man Ryan Phillips died after a collision involving two off-road motorbikes last weekend. The paper reports that Lisburn and Castlereagh Council is currently in talks to create a \\"properly regulated off-road motorsports facility\\" to prevent a repeat of the accident. Staying in Lisburn, residents in the Ballymacash area of the city have been kicking up a bit of a stink in a long-running dispute with NI Water. A \\"foul sewage odour\\" has led to repeated complaints, with one resident telling the company: \\"You've investigated several times over the years and never resolved this daily menace. The residents are sick of it.\\" NI Water assures the paper that it takes the concerns seriously and is to \\"review the history of odour problems at Ballymacash Road\\". The Londonderry Sentinel leads with a group of residents who are fed up with the state of their \\"patchwork\\" road and are taking matters into their own hands. A Strathfoyle \\"community empowerment\\" worker tells the paper his group are lobbying Transport NI to resurface Stradowen Drive, which has more than 30 \\"defects\\". He says the campaign has secured support from 100% of all 60 households on the street. Inside the paper, there's a call for Derry's women to dust off their wedding dresses for a record-breaking third time. In 2013, the city broke the world record for the biggest number of brides in the same place at the same time. Derry lost its tiara to the Chinese province of Guangdong last year, but the Sentinel says the city now wants the record back. So the date's been set, the invitations have gone out, and \\"Brides Across the Bridge\\" will return to the banks of the Foyle on 29 April. In Omagh, a violent assault on a couple as they walked home after a night in the town makes for grim reading in the Tyrone Constitution. It reports that Dwayne Bratton and his fiancee were attacked by a gang of up to eight men on High Street last weekend. Mr Bratton's sister tells the paper they are traumatised after the gang \\"repeatedly beat and kicked him until he was knocked unconscious\\". On a happier note, the paper joins in the birthday celebrations of a 100-year-old girl guide who once partied with Winston Churchill. Doreen Russell, who was born in Strabane on 21 February 1917, still enjoys a list of hobbies and clubs that could tire out 20 of today's twenty-somethings. Having worked in England during World War Two, she casually name-drops this bombshell: \\"I was fire watching at night and I met Winston Churchill, because I was invited to a party and he was there.\\" The sprightly centenarian, who could give most Millennials a run for their money, still fundraises for the Girl Guides and tells the paper that her secret to long life is working hard. \\"Always keep going with the young people, keep busy and don't ask yourself if you can do something, just do it.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article talks about different local news stories reported by various newspapers in Northern Ireland. It mentions the redevelopment of Armagh Gaol, the death of a schoolboy named John Joe Toner, potential post-Brexit checkpoints, a valuable £5 note, train services in Newry, the closure of Newry Leisure Centre, a scrambler safety concern in Lisburn, sewage problems in Ballymacash, a damaged road in Strathfoyle, a wedding dress event in Londonderry, a violent assault in Omagh, and a 100-year-old girl guide's birthday celebration in Tyrone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population.

Step 2: Identify the key event The key event in this scenario is the call received from the sister ship, which informed them about the orcas' presence.

In this case, the group would be unaware of the presence of orcas nearby.

Coming off of a win at Arrowhead that gave Kansas City their first win of the season, they headed to San Diego to take on the Chargers and their new head coach, Norv Turner. Much like their previous game, the Chiefs began with a weak showing offensively before getting a lot of use out of their rookie wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, and a touchdown catch by Tony Gonzalez (his record-tying 62nd). The TD by Gonzalez tied him with Shannon Sharpe for the most touchdown receptions by a tight end. After another TD catch by Bowe, cornerback Tyron Brackenridge ran back a fumble by San Diego to effectively win the game for Kansas City. Late into the fourth quarter, fans at Qualcomm Stadium voiced their displeasure with Turner by chanting \\"Marty! Marty! Marty!\\" in reference to former coach Marty Schottenheimer who was fired by the Chargers after their 2006 season. The win put the Chiefs 2-2 and tied them with the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders for first place in the AFC West. The win was also the 50th win in Herman Edwards' coaching career. Larry Johnson finally managed to get his first 100-yard game of the year with 123&#160;yards on 25 carries.

Problem:In many applications, ideas that are described by a set of words often flow between different groups. To facilitate users in analyzing the flow, we present a method to model the flow behaviors that aims at identifying the lead-lag relationships between word clusters of different user groups. In particular, an improved Bayesian conditional cointegration based on dynamic time warping is employed to learn links between words in different groups. A tensor-based technique is developed to cluster these linked words into different clusters (ideas) and track the flow of ideas. The main feature of the tensor representation is that we introduce two additional dimensions to represent both time and lead-lag relationships. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method is more effective than methods based on traditional clustering techniques and achieves better accuracy. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of our method in helping users understand the flow of ideas between different user groups on social media.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who studied Celtic culture and language? Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last name of the person who studied Celtic culture and language is Heseltine.

''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, answer the following question. When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? Available choices: i. After not consuming salt for more than 48 hours. ii. not enough information iii. When high amounts of salt were added during processing. iv. When sweet and fatty foods were offered at breakfast.

According to the theory of evolution, why do we die?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same, as they are asking about different aspects of life and death. Let's dive into each question to better understand their differences. 1. Why do we live if we are going to die? This question is an existential inquiry about the purpose of life in light of the inevitability of death. The question encourages reflection on the meaning of life, considering that every living being will eventually die. This is a deeply philosophical matter, open to various interpretations based on personal beliefs, cultural differences, and diverse worldviews. Answers to this question can stem from multiple philosophical, religious, or spiritual perspectives. For instance, some people argue that life is meant to be experienced and enjoyed, embracing both its triumphs and challenges. Others believe that life has a higher purpose, where we must fulfill certain responsibilities, moral codes, or spiritual aspirations. Ultimately, the meaning or reason behind living, even knowing that death is inevitable, depends on an individual's view about the nature and purpose of life itself. 2. According to the theory of evolution, why do we die? This question examines the phenomenon of death through a scientific lens, specifically referring to the theory of evolution. Evolutionary biologists aim to understand how species have evolved over time and how their traits and behaviors have been influenced by the process of natural selection. In this context, the question addresses why death has emerged as an inherent feature of life from an evolutionary perspective. There are several factors that contribute to death from an evolutionary standpoint: Aging and Senescence: Organisms age and undergo senescence, which is a decline in their physiological functions. This decline is the result of accumulated genetic damage, loss of cellular functionality, and systemic breakdown of the organism. Aging organisms ultimately succumb to death, allowing for younger, healthier, and more capable individuals in the population to survive and reproduce, thus promoting the spread of advantageous genes in the gene pool. Resource Allocation: Death also plays a role in resource allocation in ecosystems. In any given environment, resources like food, water, and habitats are finite. When organisms die, they free up valuable resources for the next generation, ensuring that their offspring can grow, thrive, and contribute to the survival of the species. Selective Pressure: Death is a crucial driver of selective pressure, influencing the process of natural selection. The survival of the fittest principle guides evolution, where organisms with better-adapted traits have a higher chance of survival and reproduction. If organisms did not die, natural selection would slow down and become less efficient. Death enables species to evolve by allowing more beneficial traits to enter the population and disadvantageous traits to be eliminated. Precipitated by Environmental Factors: Organisms in the wild are vulnerable to various environmental factors like predation, diseases, and adverse environmental conditions. These factors contribute to death, which in turn influences the course of evolution by placing selective pressure on certain genes and shaping the traits of species over time. In summary, the two questions differ as the first addresses the existential purpose of life despite the certainty of death, while the second explores the evolutionary basis for the existence of death itself. The first question warrants reflection on an individual's beliefs and worldviews, while the second has a more scientific approach, examining the role of death in nature and the evolutionary process."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations. The partitioning brought the creation of the modern Arab world and the Republic of Turkey.

This means that the characters are portrayed as complex and multifaceted, leaving room for various interpretations of their lives. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis proposes that Hickman and Sunraider might have lived their lives as secret agents according to some hints present in Ellison's writing. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise allows for multiple interpretations of the characters' lives, whereas the hypothesis specifically focuses on their potential secret agent lifestyles. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis Given that the premise mentions the possibility of various interpretations of the characters' lives, it is possible that Hickman and Sunraider having a secret life as agents could be one such interpretation. However, the premise does not directly support or confirm this hypothesis. Step 5: Discern what the premise tells us about the hypothesis The premise allows for the hypothesis to be a potential interpretation of Hickman and Sunraider's lives, but it does not provide direct evidence for it or rule out other interpretations.

Her stepfather was a steelworker, and she has a sister who would become a biology teacher. She began piano lessons at age seven. A childhood bicycle mishap resulted in her noticing a mailbox of a man named Macy Gray; she used the name in stories she wrote and later decided to use it as her stage name. While attending the University of Southern California, she agreed to write songs for a friend. A demo session was scheduled for the songs to be recorded by another singer, but the vocalist failed to appear, so Gray recorded them herself. I started forming bands and writing songs just for fun and then I really got into it and got attached to it. Then a friend of mine asked me to be a singer in his jazz band. He gave me all these jazz CDs and I studied all these different singers and I kind of taught myself how to sing for a gig, but I didn't take it seriously until later. She then met writer-producer Joe Solo while working as a cashier in Beverly Hills. Together, they wrote a collection of songs and recorded them in Solo's studio. The demo tape gave Gray the opportunity to sing at jazz cafes in Los Angeles. Although Gray did not consider her unusual voice desirable for singing, Atlantic Records signed her. She began recording her debut record but was dropped from the label upon the departure of A&R man Tom Carolan, who had signed her to the label. Macy returned to Ohio but in 1997 Los Angeles based Zomba Publishing Senior VP A&R man Jeff Blue, convinced her to return to music and signed her to a development deal, recording new songs based on her life experiences, with a new sound, and began shopping her to record labels.

Owner Scott Borchetta, who started the label in 2005, is looking for a price in excess of 200 million, sources said. While Borchetta has been building out the label of late — he just signed a new joint venture with Reba McEntire and Cumulus Group — the sale process is being clouded by a number of factors, including the fact that Swift is nearing the end of her contract with the label. The 24-year-old singer has just one album left on her current contract. Plus, Swift’s family owns a piece of the label. Without Swift, the label’s value is likely worth a lot less. Swift, the centerpiece of the Nashville, Tenn., label, has stunned the record industry yet again with first week sales of her latest album, “1989,” forecast to hit 1.2 million units. If those forecasts prove correct, “1989” will be the first platinum album of the year. Sales of the new offering may even top first week sales of her prior album, “Red,” which hit 1.2 million. One of the hottest acts in the music business, Taylor could be the first artist in history to have three albums sell more than 1 million units in their first week. A tireless promoter, Swift appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” and staged a live concert for Yahoo! and iHeartMedia this week to promote the album. The lanky artist does not stream her new music and drew some criticism from Spotify users for its absence this week. With music labels suffering from a drastic decline in iTunes downloads year-to-date, Swift’s performance is dominating music industry headlines as a rare piece of good news. The young singer, who recently moved to an apartment in Tribeca and is fronting a “Welcome to New York” marketing campaign, has moved away from her country roots and could opt to take her business in-house. To keep her, Big Machine may have to pony up an advance of between 10 million and 20 million, some music executives said. Only with Swift back under a long-term contract will Borchetta get his high sale price, the executives said. Big Machine is also nearing the end of its distribution partnership with Universal Music Group. Lucian Grainge’s UMG, naturally, could be a likely buyer of Big Machine, sources said. The two companies also have a joint venture label called Republic Nashville and jointly began a sister label called “Dot Records” earlier this year.

A French corporal who served with British soldiers in Afghanistan and admitted to eating the tongue and heart of a 90-year-old man had post-traumatic stress disorder, it has been claimed. Jérémy Rimbaud, 26, is said to have admitted breaking into the home of Lépold Pédébidau and using an iron rod to beat him over the head before cutting out parts of his body with a penknife. Cooked meat found on a plate with white beans was confirmed by forensic experts to be human, following the incident in Nouilhan, south-west France, on November 15 in the hamlet of 200 people. Corporal: French soldier Jérémy Rimbaud had been serving in Afghanistan in a tank regiment (file picture) The attack has drawn comparisons to Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film Silence Of The Lambs. The character, played by Anthony Hopkins, ate human organs ‘with some fava beans and a nice Chianti’. The son of Mr Pédébidau was alerted to what had happened by the flames coming from his father’s house nearby - which was set alight by Rimbaud following the attack, according to investigators. Rimbaud - who had been serving abroad in a tank regiment with British and US soldiers - is accused of attacking another man in France by hitting him against a tractor, reported The Daily Telegraph. The soldier allegedly told police he was 'acting on messages in his head' - and is set to face trial next year over charges of murder, violating the integrity of a corpse and attempted murder. Soldier: Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have 'posed no problems during his stint' in Afghanistan from December 2010 to June 2011 (file picture) Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have ‘posed no problems during his stint’ in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 - but has now been moved to a high-security unit for dangerous psychopaths. He left the army just nine days before allegedly committing the attack - and France Bleu Béarn cited a prosecutor as confirming that military doctors had diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD. PTSD is a reaction to a traumatic event where people can see they are in danger, or where they see other people dying or being injured in circumstances out of their control. Many victims of serious accidents, military combat, terrorist attacks, disasters and life-threatening illnesses have been diagnosed with suffering from the condition.

Plausibility: The other options like \\"teach class\\", \\"try to get\\", \\"go to class\\", and \\"study book\\" are less plausible in the context of the prompt.

Question 2: Does cannabis oil made from indica plant really cure cancer? Select from: A). no. B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Cannabis oil, also known as CBD oil or cannabidiol, has gained significant attention in recent years due to anecdotal claims that it may help alleviate certain symptoms or even cure certain diseases, such as cancer. It is essential to analyze the existing scientific evidence to provide a comprehensive answer to the questions posed. Question 1: Does cannabis oil cure cancer? Or are the sellers hoaxing? To date, there is no conclusive evidence to support the assertion that cannabis oil can cure cancer. While some preliminary studies have demonstrated potential benefits of cannabinoids, the active compounds found in cannabis, in treating certain symptoms and side effects of cancer and cancer treatments, these findings should not be interpreted as a definitive cure. Most of the research has focused on alleviating pain, nausea, and vomiting associated with cancer treatments rather than the disease itself. In laboratory settings, some studies have indicated that cannabinoids may have anti-cancer effects. However, these findings have not consistently translated to human clinical trials. Moreover, there is a lack of large-scale, well-conducted clinical trials to support claims that cannabis oil cures cancer. It is worth noting that some sellers may intentionally or unintentionally exaggerate the potential benefits of cannabis oil to promote their products or misconstrue the existing research. These claims may be driven by financial gain or based on a genuine belief in the product's curative properties. In any case, it is crucial for anyone considering using cannabis products, including cannabis oil, to consult a healthcare professional and rely on peer-reviewed scientific research rather than anecdotal evidence or marketing claims. Question 2: Does cannabis oil made from Indica plant really cure cancer? The answer to this question follows the same principles as the first question. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that cannabis oil derived specifically from the Indica plant, or any other variant of cannabis, can cure cancer. While some studies have investigated the potential therapeutic properties of individual cannabinoids or extracts from cannabis plants (e.g., THC, CBD), the efficacy of cannabis oil as a cancer cure remains inconclusive. It is important to approach such claims with skepticism and caution, regardless of the specific cannabis plant source. As with the claims surrounding cannabis oil in general, it is essential to rely on well-conducted, peer-reviewed scientific studies and the guidance of healthcare professionals when evaluating the potential benefits or risks associated with using products derived from the Indica plant or any other cannabis plant. In conclusion, the answer to both questions is A). No. Based on current scientific evidence, it is not accurate to claim that cannabis oil, whether derived from the Indica plant or otherwise, can cure cancer. While promising research suggests cannabinoids may have potential therapeutic value in treating specific symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and cancer treatments, it is crucial to distinguish this from a definitive cure for the disease. Individuals considering using cannabis products for cancer-related issues should always consult with their healthcare providers and be cautious of sellers' claims that may not be supported by rigorous scientific research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John was deeply suspicious of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king. Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty. The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time),[nb 13] his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218. John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the two songs Saint-Saëns wrote during his career?, using the article: From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The two song cycles that Saint-Saëns wrote during his career are Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: --open his beer; --close the lock; --mow the grass; The answer is:","completion":"Before Lee jumps back into the River after getting his beer, there are several steps he needs to take to ensure his safety and enjoyment. Although your options highlight three possible actions – opening his beer, closing the lock, and mowing the grass – Lee's priorities should encompass more than just these tasks. A comprehensive explanation of what Lee should do before leaping into the River is as follows: 1. Evaluate the safety of the area: Before jumping into any body of water, it's important to assess the surrounding environment for hazards or obstacles that might cause injury. Lee should take a moment to scan the River for any signs of potential danger. 2. Check water depth: Another crucial safety measure is to make sure the water is deep enough for diving or jumping. Depending on the nature of the river, Lee should either consult local knowledge or test the depth himself to ensure that he won't accidentally strike the riverbed or any submerged rocks. 3. Secure his belongings: To prevent losing or damaging his belongings, Lee should find a safe and dry place to store his possessions, including his beer. 4. Open his beer (if necessary): Depending on whether Lee wants to enjoy his beer before jumping or save it for after, he may need to open the bottle or can at this stage. However, he should be mindful of not littering or disrupting the natural environment with any waste or residue. If he decides to drink it within the river, he should avoid doing so immediately before jumping to reduce the likelihood of spilling or losing the beverage. 5. Close the lock (if applicable): This option assumes that Lee is at a waterway with a lock system in place. If that's the case, closing the lock may be necessary to control the water level or to prevent other boats from passing through while he's in the River. If closing the lock impacts others, Lee should make sure that doing so is permissible and won't negatively affect other users of the waterway. 6. Mow the grass (if relevant): Depending on the location, mowing the grass nearby may be a consideration for Lee, especially if it improves his access to the River or enhances the area's appearance. However, this task may not be necessary or directly related to his jump and could be unrelated to the actual purpose of his visit to the River. 7. Confirm someone is on standby: Though not mentioned in the given options, having a friend or bystander keep an eye on him as he jumps into the River can help ensure his safety and provide assistance if needed. In conclusion, Lee should take several precautionary measures before jumping back into the River after getting his beer. Assessing the safety and depth of the water, securing his belongings, opening his beer, closing the lock if needed, and mowing the grass if relevant are actions he can take to prepare for a safer and more enjoyable experience. Most importantly, having a friend or bystander nearby for support can significantly enhance Lee's overall safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \\"Boo-ick,\\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \\"Hupp\\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet's experience was similar. Durant brought him into a new car-building venture in 1911, hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver. Chevrolet left the company in 1913, apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles. But its name stuck to the new Chevrolet vehicles; Durant reportedly liked its musical lilt. It could also work the other way around. In 1925, Walter P. Chrysler got the naming rights to the Maxwell Motor Co. after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two-year period. Things turned out a little differently for Henry Ford. He suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name. But his revenge was sweet. The Henry Ford Company, which traded freely on Ford's early fame as an inventor, fired him in 1902 \\"because he was spending all his time developing a race car, not a passenger car,\\" according to the Encyclopedia of American Business and Biography. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers most important new car. After Ford was gone, the company was renamed Cadillac, after Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the French nobleman who founded Detroit in 1703; his heraldry became the model's badge and the company became a part of General Motors in 1909. After his firing, Ford quickly found investors to help him found his own firm, the Ford Motor Co., in 1903. He introduced the company's first new vehicle, the Model and followed it up with other low-cost vehicles, including his greatest achievement, the Model T, in 1908. Its price tag started at 850 and fell steadily as Ford introduced more production innovations. The young firm became phenomenally successful. AOL Autos: 10 classic American rides. In the 1920s, he got the chance to buy the five-year-old Lincoln Motor Co. out of bankruptcy. It was then owned by one of the very people, Henry Leland, who fired him in 1902. Then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the Lincoln name. For its part, General Motors almost didn't get the name it bears today. Durant actually incorporated his company under the name \\"International Motors Co.\\", in New Jersey in 1908. But his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name. \\"We might use 'United Motors Company' were it not for the fact that there is already a United Motor Car Company in that state,\\" the attorney wrote. \\"We suggest the name General Motors Company, as we have ascertained it can be used.\\" A newly coined French word, auto-mobile, inspired many vehicle names of the early years. Inventor Ransom E. Olds filed a patent for an \\"auto-mobile\\" during the mid-1890s. Names like Bugmobile, Locomobile, Hupmobile, and of course, the Oldsmobile, could not have come along without it. The origins of some names can be tricky to trace. The first use of Jeep, for instance. is shrouded in mist. Jim Allen, the author of a book called \\"Jeep,\\" concludes that it's based on early World War II slang for \\"a new, unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle.\\" It wasn't until 1950 that Toledo-based Willys-Overland, Inc., one of the producers of the early four-wheel-drive vehicle, trademarked the term. Many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry. The Toyota name came from the Toyoda loom works in Kariya, Japan; When it turned to car production, the Toyoda family changed the 'd' to a 't' to make it simpler and more elegant in Japanese script. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car names. There's little doubt about other brand names. Pontiac was an offshoot of the Pontiac Buggy Co., a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned Indian chief. Mechanic Soichiro Honda started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of World War II and eventually graduated to cars. AOL Autos: Pontiacs we'll never forget. Volkswagen, a response to Adolf Hitler's call for a car for the common folk, means 'people's car' in German, evidently beating out the prototype's name, 'Strength through Joy,' for the honors. In 1917, the Rapp Engine Works became known as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) as the four-year-old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines, with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo, according to some authorities. The first BMW cars were produced 11 years later. The legendary Jaguar name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time. It beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a British ad agency in 1935. In 1939, Ford struck gold with Mercury, the fleet-footed messenger of the gods. It tapped into Greek and Roman mythology for the name, just as it did for the similarly styled Lincoln Zephyr, the god of the wind, three years earlier. Some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms. Fiat stands for Fabbrica Italiani Automobili Torino, or Italian Automotive Works Turin. Similarly, Saab stands for Svenska Aeroplanaktiebolaget, or Swedish Aeroplane Ltd., hearkening back to the automaker's origins as an aircraft company. Ford might have done better with an acronym in 1958. The Edsel was conceived as a new, distinct Ford Motor Co. brand, with its own models, badge and division. The mission was to take on GM's Oldsmobile. After considering thousands of suggestions, Ford named the new brand after Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's only child. He had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943. The name Edsel was an immediate letdown. Ford stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced. One disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs of all time. Its name wasn't the sole reason for its failure. It didn't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on Ford and Mercury models. But all that didn't stop Edsel from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure.

On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years.

I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Rashomon Movie plot: The film opens on a woodcutter (æ¨æ¨µã; Kikori, played by Takashi Shimura) and a priest (ææ³å¸«; Tabi HÅshi, Minoru Chiaki) sitting beneath the RajÅmon city gate to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her... My question: What happened to the samurai's wife at the end of the duel? Answer:","completion":"At the end of the duel, as per Tajōmaru's account, the samurai's wife ran away. However, it is important to note that the movie \\"Rashomon\\" is renowned for its unique storytelling technique, where the same event is shown from different perspectives, and each perspective has a different interpretation of the events. In the wife's own account of the story, she mentions that Tajōmaru left after raping her. She then begs her husband to forgive her, but he looks at her coldly. In her version, she frees the samurai and pleads for him to kill her, after which she faints. When she wakes up, she discovers that her husband is already dead, killed by the dagger. Distraught, she attempts to kill herself but fails. Ultimately, \\"Rashomon\\" leaves the viewers to form their own interpretation of the events at the end of the movie, including the fate of the samurai's wife. The film emphasizes that the truth is subjective, and the accounts from the woodcutter, priest, bandit, and the wife offer different perspectives on the same events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham. - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim. - Macarius IV Tawil ( or Taouil ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1813 to 1815 . - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River.

After the book deal advance is spent, Brian realizes that he needs to start working on finishing his book. His girlfriend Carrie Laughlin (Michelle Forbes), a photographer, persuades him to move to California, and they decide to drive from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to California and visit infamous murder sites along the way. Short on funds, Brian posts a ride-share ad. Meanwhile, psychopathic parolee Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) has just lost his job. His parole officer (Judson Vaughn) learns of this and comes to the trailer park where Early lives with his young girlfriend Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis). Early refuses the officer's offer of a job as a college janitor, saying he wants to leave the state. The officer informs him that if he does not keep the appointment, he will be returned to prison. Early decides to go to the job interview. However, when he is on his way out, he is confronted by his landlord over non-payment of rent. Early grows violent and spins out in his car, chasing the man all over the park. Early spies the ride-share ad at the college and calls Brian, who agrees to meet him the following day.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture. Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it? Answer:","completion":"The Western land had fewer wetland plants growing on it. Step 1: Identify the characteristics of the lands. - Eastern land: covered in wetlands - Western land: rich soil, good for agriculture Step 2: Relate the characteristics to the presence or absence of wetland plants. - Wetland plants are commonly found in hypoxic soils, which are prevalent in wetland areas. - The Eastern land is covered in wetlands, suggesting it is more likely to have wetland plants. - The Western land has rich soil and is good for agriculture, which implies it is less likely to have wetland plants since agricultural lands typically have well-aerated and non-hypoxic soils. Conclusion: Based on the characteristics of the two lands, the Western land with rich soil suitable for agriculture is likely to have fewer wetland plants growing on it than the Eastern land, which is covered in wetlands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence follows a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) format: \\"Cynthia (subject) munched (verb) at peaches (object).\\" Step 2: Check for grammar and syntax errors. The verb \\"munched\\" is used correctly to describe the action of eating. However, the preposition \\"at\\" seems to be misplaced.

Information: - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Boba Fett is a fictional character in the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise. In \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\", he is a bounty hunter hired by Darth Vader and also employed by Jabba the Hutt. He was also added briefly to the original film \\"Star Wars\\" when the film was digitally remastered. \\"\\" establishes his origin as an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett raised as his son. His aura of danger and mystery has created a cult following for the character. - Return of the Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi) is a 1983 American epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand. The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas was from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. It was the third and final installment in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy and the first film to use THX technology. The film is set one year after \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and was produced by Howard Kazanjian for Lucasfilm Ltd. The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. - Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, centered on a film series created by George Lucas. It depicts the adventures of various characters \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\". - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Elizabeth Hand (born March 29, 1957) is an American writer. - Jabba Desilijic Tiure, commonly known as Jabba the Hutt (from a Slovak phrase, \\"Žaba a had\\", meaning \\"frog and snake\\") is a fictional character in the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise created by George Lucas. He is depicted as a large, slug-like alien. His appearance has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat. - The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back) is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner. Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay, with George Lucas writing the film's story and serving as executive producer. The second installment in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, it was produced by Gary Kurtz for Lucasfilm Ltd. and stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Boba Fett : Maze of Deception is a 2003 children 's science fiction book by Elizabeth Hand set in the Star Wars galaxy at the beginning of the Clone Wars . This 2003 sequel to Boba Fett : Hunted was published by Scholastic Press . The book takes place a month and a half after Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones , and 22 years before Episode IV : A New Hope . In August 2008 , the first three books in this series were repackaged as a Borders exclusive hardcover edition . The book is listed as \`\` Part I '' and it is expected that the second three books will receive similar treatment . - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If the Sun were to give off less radiation, it would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of radiation trapping by the atmosphere. Direct effect: With less solar radiation reaching the Earth, there would be less energy available for absorption. As a result, the overall amount of radiation going back into space and the amount trapped by the atmosphere would decrease. This could lead to lower average global temperatures and a potential decrease in the effects of global warming. Indirect effect: Lower solar radiation can affect various climate processes, like cloud formation, ocean circulation, and wind patterns. These climate processes can influence the composition of the atmosphere, including the concentration of greenhouse gases, which can either increase or decrease the amount of radiation trapped in the atmosphere. The exact outcome would depend on a complex interplay of factors and is difficult to predict without detailed analysis.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load? After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,...

Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara. In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, Ms Nierenberg found women farmers growing vegetables just outside their doorsteps in the Kibera settlement. She says they are finding ways to make their lives better. The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, \\"Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted.\\" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops.

In September 1982, Prime minister Margaret Thatcher travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong. Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, Hong Kong Island itself had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity, but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997. Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years.

On the first series of the game, the Jets drove to the Patriots' 13-yard line but the game remained scoreless after kicker Jay Feely missed a 31-yard field goal. Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game.

The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside., what would be the answer ?

It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. - The Kingdom of France was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe, the predecessor of the modern French Republic. It was one of the most powerful states in Europe, a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War. It was also an early colonial power, with possessions around the world. - The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom (\\"Teutonic Kingdom\\") developed out of the eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire. Like Anglo-Saxon England and medieval France, it began as \\"a conglomerate, an assemblage of a number of once separate and independent... \\"gentes\\" [peoples] and \\"regna\\" [kingdoms].\\" East Francia (\\"Ostfrankenreich\\") was formed by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty until 911, after which the kingship was elective. The initial electors were the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy (after 951), Bohemia (after 1004) and Burgundy (after 1032). - The Savoy-Carignano family, was a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. It was founded by Thomas Francis of Savoy, Prince of Carignano 21 December 1596 - 22 January 1656), an Italian military commander. His descendants were accepted as \\"princes étrangers\\" at the court of France, where some held prominent positions, eventually coming to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861 and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty's deposition in 1946. The Savoy-Carignanos also, briefly, supplied a king each to Spain and to Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal. - The Dauphiné or Dauphiné Viennois, formerly Dauphiny in English, is a former province in southeastern France, whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present departments of Isère, Drôme, and Hautes-Alpes. The Dauphiné was originally the County of Albon. - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. - The Jura Mountains are a sub-alpine mountain range located north of the Western Alps, mainly following the course of the FranceSwitzerland border. The Jura separates the Rhine and Rhône basins, forming part of the watershed of each. - Lake Geneva (or ' , sometimes ' ) is a lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France. It is one of the largest lakes in Western Europe and the largest on the course of the Rhône. 59.53% of it comes under the jurisdiction of Switzerland (cantons of Vaud, Geneva, and Valais), and 40.47% under France (department of Haute-Savoie). - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. - Savoy is a cultural region in southeast France. It comprises roughly the territory of the Western Alps between Lake Geneva in the north and Dauphiné in the south. - The House of Savoy is one of the oldest royal families in the world, being founded in 1003 in the historical Savoy region. Through gradual expansion, it grew from ruling a small county in that region to the attainment of the rank of king (of Sicily) in 1713. Through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, it led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946 and, briefly, the Kingdom of Spain in the 19th century. The Savoyard kings of Italy were Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II. The last monarch ruled for a few weeks before being deposed following the Constitutional Referendum of 1946, after which the Italian Republic was proclaimed. - The Kingdom of Bohemia, sometimes in English literature referred to as the Czech Kingdom ( sometimes ), was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Central Europe, the predecessor of the modern Czech Republic.

Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - The House of Habsburg, also called House of Hapsburg, or House of Austria, was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - Habsburg Spain refers to the history of Spain over the 16th and 17th centuries (15161700), when it was ruled by kings from the House of Habsburg (also associated with its role in the history of Central Europe). The Habsburg rulers (chiefly Charles I and Philip II) reached the zenith of their influence and power. They controlled territory that included the Americas, the East Indies, the Low Countries and territories now in France and Germany in Europe, the Portuguese Empire from 1580 to 1640, and various other territories such as small enclaves like Ceuta and Oran in North Africa. This period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the \\"Age of Expansion\\". - The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps (, ), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called \\"Central Alps\\". While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. - The Kingdom of Portugal was a monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of modern Portugal. It was in existence from 1139 until 1910. After 1248, it was also known as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves and between 1815 and 1822, it was known as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm's extensive overseas colonies. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Kingdom of Ireland (Classical Irish: '; Modern Irish: ') was a client state of the Kingdom of England that existed on Ireland from 1542 until 1800. It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown. - The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the twentieth century (10001946 with the exception of 19181920). The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom in about the year 1000; his family (the Árpád dynasty) led the monarchy for 300 years. By the 12th century, the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world. - Jure uxoris is a Latin term that means \\"by right of (his) wife\\". \\"Jure\\" is the ablative case of \\"jus\\", meaning a legal right. It is most commonly used to refer to a title of nobility held by a man because his wife holds it \\"suo jure\\" (\\"in her own right\\"). Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands \\"jure uxoris\\", \\"by right of [his] wife\\", as in England where, until the Married Women's Property Act 1882, married women were legally incapable of owning real estate. \\"Jure uxoris\\" monarchs are not to be confused with kings consort, who were merely consorts of their wives, not co-rulers. - Bohemia is the westernmost and largest historical region of the Czech lands in the present-day Czech Republic. In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including Moravia and Czech Silesia, especially in a historical context, such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - The Mexican Empire or Second Mexican Empire was the name of Mexico under a limited hereditary monarchy declared by the Assembly of Notables on July 10, 1863, during the Second French intervention in Mexico. It was created with the support of Napoleon III of France, who attempted to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas. A referendum confirmed the coronation of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, of the House of Habsburg as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. - The House of Kyburg was a noble family of grafen ( counts ) from Zürich in Switzerland . The family was one of the three most powerful noble families in the Swiss plateau beside the House of Habsburg and the House of Savoy during the 11th and 12th centuries . With the extinction of the Kyburg family 's male line in 1263 , Rudolph of Habsburg laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them to the Habsburg holdings , which marked the beginning of the Habsburgs ' rise to power .

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures. They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry. She asks Clarence if the chalkboard looks blurry and he says that it looks clear to him. Molly will ask her mom about it when she gets home from school today. But I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. What is an answer for this question: Which child isn't nearsighted? A:","completion":"A: Clarence is the child who isn't nearsighted.

But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\\" Question: If we fail to help children to overcome fears, they will _ .

The waiter was also very helpful and knowledgeable when choosing from the menu. He was attentive in the sense that he was watching us like a hawk, making sure each dish was properly served within precise timing. We were not overwhelmed when going from dish to dish, leaving room for rest in between. I'm not a fan of being rushed into each dish I order, as if I'm being served from an assembly line. Sitting at the counter seats facing the kitchen, I believe, made for a more enjoyable experience. I would suggest it with the intent that you'll probably have a better time than at a table... at least I did. Normally I'm not one to sit at seats facing a kitchen, but because this restaurant is very small and intimate, there are only a few chefs at work and you won't leave the restaurant smelling like the restaurant. You can watch how meticulously the chefs put together meals to perfection. I was lucky enough to try several things which were 'compliments of the Chef.' Decided to go for individual plates rather than opt for the tasting menu. I'm glad I did...

Not saying that it wasnt a good steak (its only hanger steak after all) but the winner was the potato puree. It was definitely a very small 'boutique' serving, but the flavor was amazing. I feel like an idiot because I can't remember the exact name of the butter which is used to make it, but my waiter had mentioned that it was some sort of imported French butter (if anyone knows what it is, please inform me so I can edit this!). Whatever it was, it totally made the potato puree. The decor was interesting and I kind of liked the concept of placing various vegetables in large jars/vases/bowls/etc., by color coordination. It makes for a nice touch, with pops of color spread throughout, against a stark black environment with touches of red furniture.. very contemporary. Its unfortunate that when you walk out of this small, posh oasis, you're thrown into the tackiness of Vegas culture: endless casino with disgusting, utterly tasteless decor and cheesy carpets.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed. It was white, too, but coarser than the medicine. She was very careful in tasting it, and she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : So I don't have many talents, but gaming happens to be one of them. Video games, board games, even trivia games I'm all above average at. My girlfriend also enjoys games, particularly video games, but isn't as skilled with them as I am. This is truly not a brag, it's relevant. My girlfriend is also the competitive sort. She frequently challenges me to different games and I almost always beat her. Out of 100 games, she might win 5 or 10 regardless of the type of game. This ends with her getting very angry, storming off or giving me the silent treatment for awhile. I understand it's frustrating to lose that often especially when you're a competitive person, so I've suggested that we just don't play against each other. She didn't like that idea. I've offered to help her practice so she could improve, but she felt that was insulting. I've tried to purposely play less than my ability, but she noticed and that made her even more mad. It's at the point now where gaming with her isn't even fun for me, because I know I'll win and she'll get a chip on her shoulder. It also seems to be less about having fun with me and more about being able to beat me for her which upsets me. When we do activities that she's good at (paintball, various sports, artistic things) she blows me out of the water. It doesn't upset me, I'm proud of her. She's more educated than me, has a higher paying job than me and is objectively more socially successful and attractive than me. It's not like I overshadow her in all walks of life, so I don't understand where her need to win is coming from. I've been called an asshole more times than I can count for repeatedly beating her when we play games. Not looking for validation, but honestly wondering what I'm doing wrong. Am I The Asshole for winning? Output:","completion":"Based on the post, it seems that OTHER (the girlfriend) is wrong in this situation.

Solve this instance: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Bowe Bergdahl is Positive . Americans are outraged over the Bowe Bergdahl sentencing November 3 that should have led to serious prison time or worse. But face it we now live in a country where deserters who cause fellow soldiers to be maimed or killed are treated as heroes if weak leftists are in charge. He should be in prison. The only difference between Bergdahl and the guy who used a Home Depot truck to mow down and kill people in New York recently is that Bergdahl displayed his allegiance to the enemy on foreign soil. Bergdahl walked because the military swamp remains filled with senior leaders who climbed the ranks curtseying to former President Obamaâs social experimentation and his upside-down value system whereby one treasonous deserter is worth five senior Taliban terrorists. Obama exchanged five of Gitmoâs finest for Bergdahl then hosted a sickening spectacle at the White House Rose Garden where a touchy-feely Obama spoke to Bergdahl âs parents âcourage.â Meanwhile Obamaâs favorite fact-twister former National Security Advisor Susan Rice made her rounds propagandizing that Bergdahl served with âhonor and distinction.â Now âthis punkâ walks thanks to in part the judge in charge Col. Jeffrey R. Nance who once said at a Fort Bragg hearing: âI will consider the presidentâs [Trumpâs] comments [regarding Bergdahl] as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence.â Nance was referring to Trumpâs less-than- complementary comments about Bergdahl . Obviously Col. Nance did just that essentially presenting Bergdahl a snowflake award punishing him with the equivalent of a hand slap despite six soldiers killed and others permanently maimed. I also believe Obamaâs and Riceâs comments about Bergdahl helped to tip the scales of justice in the wrong direction not Trumpâs. At times and when politics arenât in play military justice can be swift painful and fair. Not this time and especially not for the brave warriors maimed and killed while searching for Bergdahl . Col. Nance rewarded a traitor and Obama freed dangerous enemies most likely to face us once more in some future battle plain and simple.

Calls to the flower-shop were not helpful at all. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's name and just delighted in the beautiful white flower in soft pink paper. But I never stopped imagining who the giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender. My mother encouraged these imaginings.

Rebecca English. With a private jet and helicopter at their beck and call and al fresco dining at 3,500 metres (11,500 feet), it was the kind of weekend even Prince Harry is likely never to forget. Further details of the royal’s controversial - and, clearly, very lavish - ski holiday to Kazakhstan emerged yesterday and are unlikely to sit comfortably with human rights campaigners who have already condemned the trip. Friends of the fourth in line to throne have openly boasted about their four-day jaunt, even posting pictures from inside their plane on social media. Scroll down for video. The royal couple: Cressida Bonas and Harry in Kazakhstan, with his police protection officer behind them. Polar explorer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend, shared an image of his pretty wife, Anna, toasting the experience from the comfort of her leather-lined seat on Instagram he bragged: ‘Anna looks very happy for the “upgrade” from Ryanair this weekend : - ) #adventure #backtoreality’. His wife replied: ‘Best weekend ever : - )’ and Tweeted from the flight: ‘Amaaazing weekend. Feeling blessed.’ Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch, with furs thrown over their chairs and woven rugs placed on the grass. Amnesty International has accused the Queen’s grandson of exercising poor judgement by holidaying in a country with such an appalling human rights record. The country’s despotic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been accused of torturing and killing political opponents, stifling press freedom and profiteering from his country’s vast reserves of oil and gas. Kensington Palace have refused to comment on the prince’s ‘private’ trip or discuss who bankrolled it, although sources close to the prince insist he was merely ‘tagging along’ after being invited by friends. The Czech model: Tereza Maxova is the girlfriend of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country and is believed to have paid for the trip. However the Mail understands that it was paid for by Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country. It is understood that Mr Oymen, who lives in Monaco but has homes in several countries, sent his private plane to London to collect Harry, 29, his girlfriend of two years, Cressida Bonas, as well as Norwegian-born Mr Solheim and his wife. His long-term partner, Czech model Tereza Maxova, later published a picture taken during the weekend of a lavish picnic with the caption: ‘Shashlik [a type of Russian kebab] at 3,500m.’ Mr Oymen, 40, is the son of a senior Turkish politician and co-founder of commercial real estate developers Capital Partners. He and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who himself has close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed. In a recent interview he boasted how he wished to turn the once down-at-heel Soviet downhill ski training centre into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’. Sources close to the prince flatly deny any links between Harry and Mr Oymen and say he had never met him before the trip and has no plans to meet him again, despite his lavish hospitality. Anna Solheim, the wife of polar adventurer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend. Feast your eyes: Fur throws for a lunch at 11,500ft. Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch. But having the Queen’s grandson grace the developer’s fledging ski resort with his presence will clearly do little harm to its public image. Mr Oymen was also behind the building of Kazakhstan’s first luxury goods mall and hotel development which opened last year in a blaze of publicity. The property mogul flew out supermodel Eva Herzigova for the champagne-laced occasion which brought firms including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Armani to the oil-rich Kazakhstani elite. Calls to his office in Almaty were not being answered yesterday. The man behind the holiday is respected 41-year-old adventurer Inge Solheim, who recently led Prince Harry on a charity trek to the South Pole for the Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured service personnel. The prince’s team included several seriously injured servicemen and women and a documentary on the team’s remarkable achievement recently aired on ITV. His glamorous wife, Anna, who works as a luxury brand social media manager, posted a series of pictures taken during their weekend on the internet. All are on freely accessible sites. One showed the royal party boarding the Government-owned helicopter that chauffeured them to and from the slopes each day saying:. ‘First attempt at #helli-skiing. Eek! 4100 meters up. #altitudesickness.’ Prince Harry was attacked by human rights campaigners for taking a private jet to enjoy a weekend's skiing in Kazakhstan. Pose: Harry was happy to take photographs with members of the public while skiing. She also shared a video she had shot from inside the former Soviet military helicopter showing her husband and what appears to be Prince Harry skiing toward her, with the words: ‘Waiting in the #chopper for hubbie to appear over the horizon #heliski’. As recently as Sunday there was another ‘selfie’ showing her tucking into some delicacies picked up during the trip. The caption read: ‘eating #caviar from #kazakhstan with salmon & cream cheese #2spoiltgirls’. Mr Solheim’s spokesman did not return calls yesterday. Another photograph from the weekend, which emerged yesterday, shows Harry and his girlfriend accompanied by one of the prince’s most trusted personal protection officers. The same officer was pictured with him in a Jacuzzi on the prince’s notorious holiday to Las Vegas where he was photographed playing a game of naked billiards in a hotel suite. Local reports say the couple were met at their private jet by the ski resort manager, and stayed in a ‘cosy cottage’ close to the main slope. The couple also enjoyed hiking and glacier climbing and on their last day flew to the Dmitiev Glacier for a spot of heli-skiing.","completion":"Rebecca English, in her article, sheds light on Prince Harry's extravagant ski holiday in Kazakhstan that critics say raises some ethical questions vis-à-vis the host country's human rights record. The royal holiday, organised by polar explorer Inge Solheim, was marked by private jets, helicopters, and luxurious mountaintop meals, garnering strong criticism from human rights campaigners. According to the report, the attendees openly celebrated their four-day outing, sharing images of their opulent escapade on social media platforms. Solheim's wife, Anna, was among those who toasted to the weekend adventure from her leather lined seat in the aircraft, sharing her excitement over the trip on Instagram. Prince Harry's trip to Kazakhstan, ruled by controversial figure Nursultan Nazarbayev, soon sparked discussion among human rights activists. Amnesty International criticised the Prince's vacation in a country charged with a poor human rights record, including accusations of torturing and killing political opponents. Critics also raised concerns about the alleged censorship of press freedom and the profiteering from the country's oil and gas reserves under Nazarbayev's leadership. While Kensington Palace declined to comment on the royal's private trip or reveal the sponsor, the article discloses that the trip was financed by Burak Oymen, a Turkish native property developer profiting substantially from Kazakhstan's luxury development projects. Contrary to his financial involvement in the vacation, the connection between Harry and Oymen was downplayed by sources close to the Prince. They stated that he had never met Oymen prior to the trip and does not intend to do so afterward, notwithstanding his generous hosting. More details revealed that the trip was orchestrated by adventurer Inge Solheim. He is well-known to Harry, having recently led him in a charity trek to the South Pole for the 'Walking With The Wounded' charity, in support of injured servicemen and women. The choice of destination has been justified by its potential advertising value to Oymen's budding ski resort, which he aims to recast as the 'Courcheval of Kazakhstan'. The article asserts that the presence of the Queen’s grandson in Oymen's fledgling ski resort can uplift its public profile significantly. In a bid to cater to Kazakhstan's wealthy class, Oymen was also instrumental in establishing Kazakhstan's first luxury merchandise mall—a move that received massive publicity—with supermodel Eva Herzigova being present for the occasion. The holiday had its moments of thrill and adventure as well, featuring helicopter skiing. Pictures from the trip portrayed Prince Harry and his girlfriend, accompanied by one of the prince’s most entrusted personal protection officers, frolicking in the fun. Prince Harry's luxurious Kazakh adventure continues to draw flak from critics, questioning the ethical dimensions of fraternising with countries harbouring questionable human rights records.

In some of these reports, the newscasters say that authorities are dismissing some of the random explosions as accidental.

Off to one side, another man lies wounded, also out of ammunition. The wounded man asks Joshua, 'Don't let it be him.'Joshua checks a mobile device and sees a display with one dot in the center, and another dot rapidly approaching the centered one. Gene Walker (John Lynch), a long-haired man with an automatic rifle arrives on the scene, taunting Joshua and opening fire. He sprays the area with bullets, further wounding the wounded man. Joshua manages to hit a button that causes the meat hooks, some still with large slabs of meat on them, to begin moving, providing him some cover as he runs.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the main issue affecting robins' singing patterns according to the article? A) Robins are singing more frequently due to an increase in their population. B) Artificial light from street lamps, signs, and homes is disrupting robins' biological clocks, causing them to sing day and night. C) The noise from urban environments is forcing robins to change their singing patterns. D) Robins are adapting to new environments by mimicking the sounds of industrial machinery.

This step involves the process of consuming and breaking down the food through mechanical processes like chewing and chemical processes like the action of salivary enzymes. Here is a revised version of the process with the missing first step included: 1. The recognition and ingestion of food by the body: When a person consumes food, the digestion process begins through the mechanical act of chewing, which breaks the food down into smaller pieces. At the same time, salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down the food chemically. This mixture of broken-down food and saliva is then swallowed and passed down through the esophagus into the stomach. 2. They secrete digestive juice 'externally' into the small intestine: After the food has been partially digested in the stomach, the chyme (a semi-fluid mixture of partially digested food and stomach secretion) is released into the small intestine. The pancreas releases its digestive juices, containing enzymes that further break down the food components. 3. There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates: The digestive juices secreted by the pancreas contain enzymes such as lipase for breaking down fats, protease for breaking down proteins, and amylase for breaking down carbohydrates. These enzymes help break the complex macromolecules into smaller units that can be easily absorbed by the small intestine. 4. Digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine: The digestive juices released by the pancreas flow through the pancreatic duct and into the small intestine, where they mix with the chyme and continue the process of breaking down the nutrients into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body. 5. When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released: The absorption of glucose (a monosaccharide resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates) by the small intestine causes an increase in blood sugar levels. In response, the pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone which helps to regulate blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose in the body's cells, particularly in the liver and muscles. 6. When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream: In contrast, when blood sugar levels fall below normal levels, such as during periods of fasting or intense physical activity, the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon. Glucagon helps to raise blood sugar levels by stimulating the process of glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose), which is then released into the bloodstream. In summary, the missing first step in the described process is the recognition and ingestion of food, which involves the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food through chewing and the action of salivary enzymes. This initial step is crucial in initiating the various events leading to the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and the regulation of blood sugar levels by the actions of insulin and glucagon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People familiar with the matter said Tuesday that GM sees Peugeot as its \\"primary partner\\" in Europe. The sources said that France's largest carmaker had no plans to take a reciprocal stake in GM. Peugeot shares jumped seven percent in Paris afternoon trade. Earlier Tuesday, French newspaper Les Echos said Detroit-based GM was nearing a deal to purchase slightly less than five percent of Peugeot. The two automakers were first reported last week to be mulling a strategic alliance that would include some joint production in Europe. The potential-tie up comes as GM scrambles to turn around its struggling European operations. GM said earlier this month that it lost 747 million in the region during 2011, despite record profits for the fiscal year worldwide.

He seemed to be trying to shield her from touching him - not his genitals , but the wound itself . He moaned and his sweating forehead struck her shoulder when he half - sat up . What may have happened to him ?","completion":"Based on the given passage, it seems that the character, Manji, has been injured, possibly due to combat or an accident. The details provided in the text, such as the \\"streaming wound\\" in his lower belly, suggest that he has experienced a deep and severe laceration or stab wound. This type of injury would likely cause significant pain and discomfort, as well as possible blood loss, which can lead to further complications such as weakness, dizziness, and even unconsciousness. Manji's actions in the scene indicate that he is not only aware of his injury but is also trying to prevent the other person from coming into contact with it. This could be due to a concern for the individual's safety, embarrassment, or fear of vulnerability. The fact that he moans and his forehead strikes the other person's shoulder as he attempts to sit up further emphasizes the severity of his condition. It is worth noting that Manji seems more concerned about shielding the other person from his wound rather than his genitals, which highlights the gravity of the situation. There could be several factors leading to Manji's injury, such as engaging in a physical altercation or being involved in an accident. As the text does not provide further context or background information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact incident that led to his current state. Nonetheless, the given information suggests that his condition has resulted in extreme physical distress, prompting him to take precautionary measures with the other individual. In summary, it appears that Manji has sustained a serious injury in his lower abdomen that has led to intense pain and discomfort. Although the cause of the injury remains unknown, his actions signal that he is trying to protect others from his wound and cope with the severity of his condition.

How to choose the right fuel for your car Use diesel fuel if your vehicle is designed for it. Engines designed to run on diesel fuel operate differently than those designed to run on regular gasoline. Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and instead rely on the compression of the air and fuel to ignite the mixture alone. OPTIONS: A). Diesel fuel can give your vehicle the ability to warm up drastically due to low compression and the higher engine collective. It is considered diesel fuel if the fuel on the tank is less than 150 , 000 a year. B). Because of this, diesel fuel is less stable and cannot be used in engines designed for gasoline. Diesel vehicles usually have clear \\" diesel only \\" markings on the inside of their fuel doors, and traditional gas pumps won't fit in their filler necks. C). Diesel fuel tends to smell strongly of sulfur and rust often because of engine fire. Each engine is different and you should narrow down the range of various fuel types to see what types of fuel were included with your car before choosing your fuel option. D). For the sake of convenience, diesel fuel is necessary when your vehicle is built for air travel. Fuel your vehicle's fuel tank with diesel fuel.","completion":"Option B is the most logical next event in the context of choosing the right fuel for your car. Diesel fuel is specifically designed for vehicles that operate on diesel engines. These engines are built differently than gasoline engines and have special requirements that must be met in order to function properly. Because of these differences, using diesel fuel in an engine designed for gasoline can lead to severe damage and costly repairs. One of the significant distinctions between diesel and gasoline engines is that diesel engines do not rely on spark plugs for ignition. Instead, they compress air and fuel to generate the necessary heat and pressure for combustion. Due to this, diesel fuel is formulated differently than gasoline to allow for the specific conditions needed in a diesel engine. When selecting the right fuel for your car, it is vital to pay attention to the type of engine your vehicle has. Typically, diesel vehicles will have clear markings near their fuel doors indicating that they require diesel fuel only. In addition, the fuel nozzle size at most gas stations has been designed so that gasoline pumps will not fit in diesel filler necks, preventing accidental misfueling. It is important to note that using the wrong type of fuel can have serious consequences. These can include damage to the engine and other components, loss of engine power, and even a complete breakdown, necessitating expensive repairs. By ensuring you are always using the appropriate fuel for your vehicle, you can avoid these problems while maintaining optimal performance and increasing the lifespan of your car. In conclusion, when choosing the right fuel for your car, it is essential to consider the type of engine your vehicle has. Be aware of any indications or markings that point to the correct fuel type, and make sure to fuel your vehicle with the appropriate option. Diesel fuel should be used in diesel engines, as is noted in Option B, due to differences in engine design and function – preventing accidental engine damage and ensuring the best performance for your vehicle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether elevated plasma levels of biomarkers reflecting endothelial dysfunction (E-selectin; intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]; and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1]) predict development of type 2 diabetes in initially nondiabetic women. DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective, nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing US study initiated in 1976. PARTICIPANTS Of 121 700 women initially enrolled, 32 826 provided blood samples in 1989-1990; of those free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline, 737 developed incident diabetes by 2000. Controls (n = 785) were selected according to matched age, fasting status, and race. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Risk of confirmed clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes by baseline levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. RESULTS Baseline median levels of the biomarkers were significantly higher among cases than among controls (E-selectin, 61.2 vs 45.4 ng/mL; ICAM-1, 264.9 vs 247.0 ng/mL; VCAM-1, 545.4 vs 526.0 ng/mL [all P values < or =.004]). Elevated E-selectin and ICAM-1 levels predicted incident diabetes in logistic regression models conditioned on matching criteria and adjusted for body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, smoking, diet score, alcohol intake, activity index, and postmenopausal hormone use. The adjusted relative risks for incident diabetes in the top quintile vs the bottom quintiles were 5.43 for E-selectin (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.47-8.50), 3.56 for ICAM-1 (95% CI, 2.28-5.58), and 1.12 for VCAM-1 (95% CI, 0.76-1.66). Adjustment for waist circumference instead of BMI or further adjustment for baseline levels of C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, and hemoglobin A(1c) or exclusion of cases diagnosed during the first 4 years of follow-up did not alter these associations. CONCLUSION Endothelial dysfunction predicts type 2 diabetes in women independent of other known risk factors, including obesity and subclinical inflammation.

When Natalia discovers that Fritz is a Jew, despite her hurt feelings, they reconcile, accept their love for each other, and ultimately decide to get married. Natalia Landauer herself is another prominent German Jewish character in Cabaret. Natalia's family is wealthy and owns a large department store in Berlin. She becomes friends with Brian and Sally after Fritz introduces her to Brian as an English language student. Natalia represents the German Jewish community that was well-off before the rise of the Nazis, but soon faced persecution as Hitler gained power. Although other German Jews are not explicitly identified, the presence of the Nazi Party and the consequent persecution of the Jewish community in Berlin becomes tangible as the film progresses. For instance, the musical number \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\" sees a young member of the Hitler Youth singing an anthem for the emerging Nazi movement, slowly revealing the swastika on his sleeve. This scene showcases the growth of the Nazi Party's influence in Germany and the city of Berlin during this time. In conclusion, the central German Jewish characters in Cabaret are Fritz Wendel and Natalia Landauer. Although the primary storyline revolves around the relationship between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Fritz and Natalia's story serves as a reminder of the complex social, political, and cultural context in Berlin during the rise of the Nazi Party and its devastating impact on the German Jewish community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Context: B7-H1, a co-inhibitory molecule of the B7 family, is found aberrantly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and infiltrating macrophage/dendritic-like cells, and plays a critical role in immune evasion by ovarian cancer. IL-12, an inducer of Th1 cell development, exerts immunomodulatory effects on ovarian cancer. However, whether IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in human ovarian cancer associated-macrophages has not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IL-12 on the expression of B7-H1 in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages and possible mechanisms.', 'PMA induced THP-1-derived macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) or infected with adenovirus carrying human IL-12 gene (Ad-IL-12-GFP) for 24 h, then cocultured with the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line for another 24 h. Macrophages were collected for real-time PCR and Western blot to detect the expression of B7-H1, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, supernatants were collected to assay for IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-10 by ELISA. In addition, monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ were cocultured with SKOV3 and determined for the expression of B7-H1. Furthermore, the expression of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was also evaluated after blocking NF-κB signaling.', 'The expression of B7-H1 was significantly upregulated in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP compared with the control groups (p<0.05), accompanied by a remarkable upregulation of IFN-γ (p<0.05), a marked downregulation of IL-10 (p<0.05) and activation of NF-κB signaling. However, the upregulation of B7- H1 was inhibited by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway (p<0.05). Expression of B7-H1 was also increased (p<0.05) in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ and cocultured with SKOV3. By contrast, the expression of B7-H1 in THP-1-derived macrophages was significantly decreased when treated in the same way as monocyte-derived macrophages (p<0.05), and IL-10 was also significantly decreased but IFN-γ was almost absent.Question: Does iL-12 regulate B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signalling?","completion":"Task: Determine whether IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signaling based on context provided. Guidelines: 1. Read the context to understand the relation between IL-12 and B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages. 2. Identify the experiments conducted for the clarification. 3. Note the results and outcomes of the experiments. 4. Determine the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation process. Solution: 1. The context talks about IL-12 playing a role in the immunomodulation of ovarian cancer and its effect on the expression of B7-H1 in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages. 2. Experiments conducted include treating macrophages with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP, coculturing with SKOV3 cells, blocking NF-κB signaling, and analyzing cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ, and IL-10) by ELISA. 3. Results show a significant upregulation of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP, accompanied by upregulation of IFN-γ, downregulation of IL-10, and activation of NF-κB signaling. B7-H1 upregulation was inhibited when NF-κB signaling was blocked. 4. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signaling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the Beatles band member that had a son Zak? By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. On the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. George Harrison informed Epstein that he was...

What number, between two hyphens, is used by journalists, etc., to mark the end of a newspaper or broadcast story????","completion":"The number between two hyphens that is used by journalists to mark the end of a newspaper or broadcast story is \\"30.\\" This tradition has its roots in the history of journalism and the telegraph. Traditionally, \\"-30-\\" is added at the end of a news article or press release to signify its conclusion. It serves as a clear indication to the editor or reader that the story is complete and that there is no more information to follow. This practice has been carried on since the days when newsrooms relied on telegraphs for communication across long distances. It has been largely influenced by the use of Morse code within the journalistic community. The origin of the use of \\"30\\" as a concluding mark can be attributed to several explanations and theories. The most common theory is related to Morse code: In the 19th century, newsrooms made heavy use of telegraph machines to transfer information and news across the country. The number \\"30\\" in Morse code is represented by three short taps (dah-dit-dah-dit) followed by zero, which is a long and short tap (dah-dah-dah-dit). The number \\"30\\" was easy to recognize and served as a convenient way to signal the end of a transmission. When sending telegrams, a simple and quick way to denote a finished message was by ending it with \\"30.\\" Another theory suggests that in the past, U.S. papers were typically 30 inches long, so reporters were often asked to write stories that were 30 inches in length. Thus, the number \\"30\\" came to symbolize the conclusion of a story. A different theory links the tradition to older reporting and printing practices. Before computers and digital technology, journalists used handwritten symbols to instruct the typesetter on how to set up the print. These symbols gave directions on punctuation, capitalization, and other formatting instructions. The number \\"30\\" might have been one such symbol representing the end of a text. While the use of \\"-30-\\" has diminished with the emergence of modern technology and digitization of news reporting, its significance is still acknowledged among journalists, particularly within the context of historical traditions. Despite the changes in the industry, the symbol serves as a nostalgic reminder of journalism's rich past and the methods used to ensure accurate and effective communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Sabina Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge (imparted by an angel's voice that speaks in German) that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse (since her mother was unfaithful). Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin.Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleule (André Hennicker), the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients.

Answer the following question: Grasses supply most of the food consumed by people worldwide, and grasses and other herbaceous plants are preferred food. Given these facts, what do herbaceous plants supply the world with among the following options: - oxygen - growth - Energy - Crops - seeds - food - life - Carbon Answer:","completion":"Herbaceous plants, including grasses, supply the world with several essential elements that support human life and ecological balance. Among the options provided, herbaceous plants significantly contribute to the following aspects: 1. Oxygen: Like all green plants, herbaceous plants play a vital role in producing oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and in turn, release oxygen. This process helps maintain a balance of gases within the Earth's atmosphere and provides breathable air for humans and other organisms. 2. Energy: Herbaceous plants are a primary source of energy. They capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis, converting sunlight into carbohydrate molecules. These molecules act as an energy source for the herbivorous animals that consume them, which in turn are consumed by carnivores. In this manner, herbaceous plants initiate the flow of energy through various trophic levels in an ecosystem's food chain. 3. Crops: Grasses, as part of the herbaceous plants group, are a critical component of agriculture, providing staple crops such as rice, wheat, corn, barley, and millet. These crops are responsible for feeding billions of people worldwide and represent the foundation of human food systems. Moreover, many other herbaceous plants are cultivated for their leaves, roots, and tubers, contributing to the wide diversity of crops that sustain diverse human diets. 4. Seeds: Many herbaceous plants produce seeds, which serve as a primary means of reproduction for these species. Seeds are also a crucial food source for various animals, including birds and small mammals. In addition, seeds from certain herbaceous plants, such as sunflower, flax, and chia, are consumed by humans for their nutritional value and potential health benefits. 5. Food: As mentioned earlier, herbaceous plants provide most of the world's food supply. These plants are not only a source of carbohydrates, but they also offer essential vitamins, minerals, and fibers to support a healthy diet. In many parts of the world, herbaceous plants are the primary source of nutrition and sustenance for local communities. 6. Life: Beyond their direct contributions to human diets, herbaceous plants are essential in supporting diverse ecosystems and maintaining ecological balance. These plants offer food and habitat for various insects, birds, and mammals, contributing to the overall biodiversity of the planet. Furthermore, herbaceous plants help with soil formation, water retention, and maintaining soil fertility, thus playing an indispensable role in overall ecosystem health. While carbon is not a distinct contribution of herbaceous plants to the world, it is a component of the global carbon cycle. Through the process of photosynthesis, these plants absorb carbon dioxide and contribute to carbon sequestration by storing it in their biomass. In this sense, herbaceous plants can be seen as indirectly supplying the planet with carbon management benefits. Although growth was not specified in the options, herbaceous plants possess the ability to renew and regrow, which is essential for maintaining a renewable and sustainable food system, ultimately contributing to the growth and resiliency of ecosystems across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: The film is set in 1920s China during the warlord era, years before the Chinese Civil War. Nineteen-year-old Songlian ( Sònglián, played by Gong Li), whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, marries into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress ( Sì tàitai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly-lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.Songlian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine he will spend the night with; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections.The First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun ( Zhuóyún, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan ( Méishn, He Caifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.Songlian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er ( Yàn'ér, played by Kong Lin) who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.Zhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's \\"pregnancy\\". Doctor Gao ( Go-yshng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a Mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the Master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.Yan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a \\"robe\\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.As Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun; who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room on the roof of the estate and hanged to death by the master's servants.Songlian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the master's marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, having gone completely insane.

Question: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, after the breakdown of glucose and production of carbon dioxide, is the exhalation of carbon dioxide and other waste products out of the body. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Inhalation: A person inhales oxygen through their nose or mouth, which then travels into the trachea (windpipe) and further divides into bronchial tubes entering the lungs. 2. Gas exchange in the lungs: The bronchial tubes branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles, which end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. The oxygen in the inhaled air diffuses from the alveoli into the surrounding capillaries (small blood vessels) and binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. 3. Transport of oxygen: Oxygenated blood is transported from the lungs to the heart, and then pumped by the heart throughout the body via the circulatory system, delivering oxygen to cells in various tissues. 4. Cellular respiration: Inside the cells, oxygen is used to break down glucose (a simple sugar derived from food) through a process called cellular respiration. This process consists of a series of chemical reactions (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain) that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as the main energy source for the cell. 5. Production of carbon dioxide: As a byproduct of cellular respiration, carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced during the oxidation of glucose. 6. Exhalation: Carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs through the circulatory system, where it diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. The person then exhales the carbon dioxide, along with other waste products and water vapor, out of the body through the mouth or nose, completing the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As more schools and educators have adopted this unique teaching tool, it has sparked new discussions and debates on nuclear disarmament, diplomacy, and international relations among younger generations. The documentary has also attracted the interest of political leaders and diplomats, who study the events of the Cuban missile crisis to help understand the potential consequences of unchecked aggression. It has become a key reference material in crisis management training for government officials around the world. In response to the heightened interest, the John F. Kennedy Library has expanded its online resources related to the Cuban missile crisis, providing even greater access to those who wish to delve deeper into this crucial period of the Cold War. In a time when issues of nuclear proliferation and international tensions continue to make headlines, \\"Clouds Over Cuba\\" serves as both a vivid reminder of the consequences of unchecked aggression, and a call to action for present-day leaders to work tirelessly to prevent the mistakes of the past. The documentary urges its viewers to consider the importance of diplomacy, negotiation, and international cooperation in the face of escalating tensions. In recognition of the documentary's significant impact, filmmakers have been invited to present the film at several international conferences and cultural events, including the United Nations General Assembly, where it has been hailed as an important contribution to the global understanding of the importance of peace and diplomacy. Moreover, \\"Clouds Over Cuba\\" has led to renewed efforts to uncover and examine previously unknown or overlooked aspects of the Cuban missile crisis. Historians and researchers continue to work closely with the John F. Kennedy Library and other archives, discovering new materials that shed light on the intricacies of the crisis. These findings have sparked new scholarly debates and interpretations of the events, prompting historians to re-examine both Soviet and United States perspectives on the crisis. At its core, the success of \\"Clouds Over Cuba\\" lies in its unique ability to transport viewers back to a time when the threat of nuclear war loomed large, reminding us all of the dire consequences of actions taken—or not taken—in moments of crisis.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress? is inside the article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and..., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the Antonia Fortress was located in Jerusalem.

Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.

Write a title for this article: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Uriel Sinai/Getty Images) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an interview last week to the BBC's Persian-language station, which is beamed directly into Iran, in which he made a gaffe that ended up drawing quite a bit of criticism. \\"If the people of Iran were free, they could wear jeans, listen to Western music and have free elections,\\" he said. The elections might not be so free, and some Western music is officially banned, if generally tolerated. But Iranians do wear jeans -- as a great many of them pointed out by posting photos of themselves in denim online, often with a message deriding the Israeli leader for his ignorance. It's not exactly shocking that Iranians, inside the country and in the larger diaspora, would mock Netanyahu. This was an opportunity for Iranians to express their dislike of the Israeli leader as well as their own national pride, a significant force in any country but particularly in Iran. But there's more here than meets the eye, and the incident is a small but telling little flashpoint in the ongoing American-Israeli-Iranian dance over the future of Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu's comment touched on a common perception in Iran: that the country is mistreated and misunderstood by a bellicose and condescending West. Anything that entrenches that idea is not going to help with the ongoing efforts to find either a nuclear deal or a larger detente. One little incident is not going to dramatically shift the national mood in Iran, of course, but what Western leaders say and do over the next months and years of diplomacy could certainly help shape the conversation inside the country. Though Tehran and Washington are leading that effort, there's no denying that Israel will play a major role in the process. Netanyahu's comments are a reminder of that, and a sign of the sort of role he might play. Netanyahu's error, as a factual point, was not a particularly significant one. Iran does have clothing restrictions, even if he overstated them. But the comment came as part of his larger appeal to the Iranian people, in which he seemed to suggest that they overthrow their government. \\"You, the Persians, will never get rid of this tyranny if it is armed with nuclear weapons,\\" he said, alluding to the protests of 2009. Among Iran analysts, though, it's generally accepted that most Iranians within the country want to see their system reformed, not toppled, and that 2009 was a part of that. The mission of overthrowing the regime is a mostly Western one, though the Obama administration has moved away from it. It's also a goal that tends to rally Iranians around their government and against the West, not the other way around. Even if Netanyahu were the sort of person who could compellingly speak directly to Iranians, and even if Iranians were ready to hear him out, the Israeli leader's message here may not have been the sort of language likely to bring the two sides together. That goes beyond jeans, although the flub was part of it: The Israeli leader seemed to portray Iran as a totalitarian prison of a country, run by a small band of hated tyrants. But as some have noted, this sounds more like North Korea than Iran. The Islamic Republic has some of the world's worst civil rights, but it is a far cry from Pyongyang's style of rule, and is not peopled with 78 million Iranians just waiting to be liberated. The biggest obstacle to any nuclear deal or larger detente may ultimately come from the hard-liners within Tehran, up to and including the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Their largest objection is that the Westerners cannot be trusted because they're bent on the Islamic Republic's destruction, a fear that Netanyahu's framing of the matter doesn't help. Their biggest political weapon is Iranian nationalism tinged with anti-Western ideology; any time Iranians feel lectured by an Israeli leader, that sentiment risks ticking up a bit. It's a telling little irony that, when Netanyahu criticized Iran's severe restriction of civil liberties, it led Iranians not to criticize their government but Israel's -- and to do it using the very social networks, such as Facebook, that are banned by Tehran. This was a relatively minor misstep in public diplomacy, but it's a worrying indication for Washington and Tehran of the sort of role that the Israeli leader sees himself playing in their burgeoning outreach. is the Post's foreign affairs blogger.

In the 1300's, English farmers hired children to protect their crops. They were called \\"bird scares\\". The children chased birds and threw stones at them. Bird scares were replaced in the 1800's by scarecrows. A scarecrow is anything that is set in a field to scare birds away. Often it is a pole dressed like a person. Some farms with small fields still use scarecrows today. Farming became big business in the twentieth century. Scarecrows could no longer protect the huge fields of grain, so farmers used poisonous chemicals on the fields. The poison made the grain bitter. The birds usually would not eat the bitter grain. Although they can prevent crops from being destroyed by insects and birds, some chemicals can be harmful to humans. Therefore, farmers are using fewer chemicals now than they did twenty years ago. Perhaps scarecrows may be seen more often in the fields in the future.

Next question: when did england declare war on germany 1939?","completion":"On September 3, 1939, England, officially known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, declared war on Germany. This declaration came in response to the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II. The United Kingdom and France had committed to defending Poland in case of military aggression through a mutual defense agreement called the Anglo-Polish Agreement, formed in March 1939. After Germany attacked Poland, the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, sent an ultimatum to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi regime in Germany, demanding the immediate withdrawal of German forces from Poland. The ultimatum specified that if Germany failed to comply, Britain would be at war with Germany. On September 3, 1939, at around 9:00 am, the deadline of the ultimatum passed without a response from Hitler. As a result, Chamberlain announced on a national radio broadcast at 11:15 am that Britain was now officially at war with Germany. Soon after, France, Australia, New Zealand, and other Allied nations also declared war on Germany, emphasizing their commitment to protect the independence and sovereignty of Poland and to resist the aggressive expansionist policies of the Nazi regime. This crucial moment in history led to a six-year-long conflict involving most of the world's nations, during which unprecedented destruction, genocide, and other war crimes were committed. The Allies, including the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States, eventually emerged victorious, but the loss of life, infrastructure, and economic upheaval left deep scars that persisted long after the war ended in 1945."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lack of assertiveness: When someone is unable to express their feelings and needs assertively, this frustration can turn into anger over time. Anger can be a way of asserting control or expressing displeasure about a perceived injustice. 4. Unresolved emotional issues: Anger can be a symptom of underlying emotional issues that have not been addressed, such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, grief, or guilt. 5. Stress: High stress levels can make a person more susceptible to irritability and anger. Chronic stress can take a toll on your mental health, leading to a shorter fuse and a lower tolerance for frustration. 6. Feeling misunderstood: Communication problems can lead to misunderstandings, which in turn can result in anger. When someone feels misunderstood, they might become defensive and lash out in anger. 7. Physical factors: Health problems such as hormonal imbalances, sleep deprivation, and chronic pain can contribute to heightened anger. Additionally, certain medications or substances, including alcohol and drugs, can also affect mood and lead to increased irritability and anger. Answer 2: How can I control my anger? Managing and controlling anger effectively will largely depend on understanding the factors causing it. Here are some steps to follow for controlling anger: 1. Self-awareness: Become aware of situations and triggers that cause you to feel angry. Recognize the initial signs of anger in your body, such as increased heart rate and clenched fists. 2. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help to calm your body and mind when you start to feel angry. 3. Cognitive restructuring: Change the way you think about situations that make you angry. Instead of jumping to conclusions or making negative assumptions, try to see things from another perspective and focus on rational and balanced thinking. 4. Develop assertiveness: Learn to convey your feelings, needs, and boundaries in a respectful and assertive manner, without being aggressive or passive. Clear communication can help prevent misunderstandings and reduce anger. 5. Take a break: When you feel overwhelmed with anger, give yourself time to cool off before addressing the situation. Distance yourself from the trigger and engage in a calming activity, such as reading, writing, or listening to music. 6. Utilize problem-solving strategies: Focus on addressing the issue at hand and find constructive solutions rather than dwelling on the anger itself. 7. Seek professional help: If you are struggling to manage your anger on your own, consider seeking help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and techniques to help you better understand and manage your anger. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The first answer addresses the reasons why you might be getting angry easily, while the second answer provides effective strategies for controlling your anger. By understanding the root causes of your anger and following these steps, you can work towards better anger management and overall emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center? ? The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza.

A. aching back B. make mistakes C. big muscles D. lower back pain E. sore muscles The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is E. sore muscles. When a person uses their whole body for work, they are likely to experience sore muscles. This is because muscles can become sore after strenuous or unfamiliar physical activity. This could involve lifting heavy items, manual labor, or prolonged periods of physical exertion. Over time, these activities can cause fatigue and discomfort in the muscles. While the other options, such as an aching back (A) and lower back pain (D) could certainly also be a concern for people engaging in intense physical labor, option E is more comprehensive, covering the entire body rather than just the back. Option B, making mistakes, does not directly correlate to physical body usage, and option C, big muscles, is not typically a complaint as much as a possible result of rigorous physical activity. However, keep in mind that different individuals might experience different symptoms based on various factors like their health condition, the nature of their work, their fitness level etc. Hence, consistent body discomfort/pain should not be ignored and professional medical advice should always be sought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Judith Miller (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator. She worked in The New York Times' Washington bureau before joining Fox News. Accused by, among others, Edward Said, for a purported anti-Islamic bias in her writing, Miller became embroiled in controversy after her coverage of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion was discovered to have been based on the inaccurate information in the intelligence investigations, particularly those stories that were based on sourcing from the now-disgraced Ahmed Chalabi. The New York Times later determined that a number of stories she had written for the paper were inaccurate. In July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from The New York Times, Miller was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating a leak naming Valerie Plame as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Vice President Cheney's Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame's CIA identity was divulged publicly in a column by conservative political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Novak's source was revealed to have not been Libby, but Richard Armitage of the Department of State. On July 16, 2005, The Washington Post reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated. The Post suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly interested in hearing Miller's version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005. For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks before Joseph Wilson's New York Times editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his Times editorial. According to Miller's notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name \\"Valerie Flame [sic]\\". This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame's name and unmasked her as a CIA operative. Miller's grand jury account was the basis for her last article in the Times. Miller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007. The trial ended on March 6, 2007, with Libby's conviction on four of five counts, though none of the counts had to do with actually revealing Plame's name to the media. The New York Times published Miller's first-person account, \\"My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room\\", on October 16, 2005. Miller claimed she could not remember who gave her the name \\"Valerie Plame\\" but she was sure it didn't come from Libby. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what happened or was stated in the telephone call?","completion":"In the telephone call, Scooter Libby, the person Judith Miller had met earlier, confirmed to her that it was okay to stop keeping their conversation a secret.

Mark and his brother Jeffrey have to leave their cars outside because their parents' cars take up the entire garage. Mark's car has a very dark interior, while Jeffrey's car has a lighter colored interior. It is mid-afternoon on a sunny day in July, and Mark and Jeffrey are deciding which car they want to take to go to the movies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which car, Mark's or Jeffrey's, will be hotter on the inside? Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, Mark's car will most likely be hotter on the inside compared to Jeffrey's car. This is due to the dark-colored interior of Mark's car which has a higher tendency to absorb sunlight, causing the interior temperature to rise more significantly. On the other hand, Jeffrey's car has a lighter-colored interior, which means it reflects more sunlight and thus absorbs less energy, leading to a comparatively cooler interior temperature. The absorption of light energy by darker colors occurs as a result of the material properties of these colors, which are less likely to reflect or transmit the light that strikes them. When a dark interior material, such as the seats or the dashboard, is exposed to sunlight, it absorbs the light and converts it into thermal energy. This results in an increase in temperature of the material, making the car's interior hotter. In contrast, lighter colors have a natural tendency to reflect more sunlight, meaning that they are less likely to absorb the light energy and contribute to higher temperatures inside the car. This is why vehicles with lighter-colored interiors generally feel cooler compared to those with darker-colored interiors when parked in direct sunlight. Therefore, given the choice between Mark's car with a dark interior and Jeffrey's car with a lighter-colored interior, the better option for a more comfortable ride to the movies on a sunny July afternoon would be to take Jeffrey's car, as it is less likely to be excessively hot inside due to its lighter interior color."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

These actions may include warnings, fines, or even disqualification from competitions, depending on the severity of the infraction. Step-by-step process for handling this situation: 1. Analyze the allegations: FIFA will thoroughly examine the information provided by the Fare network and cross-check it with match reports, video footage, and any other available evidence. 2. Collaborate with stakeholders: FIFA will liaise with local authorities, stadium staff, and security personnel to gather more information about the incidents in question and identify any perpetrators. 3. Conduct investigations: Depending on the gathered evidence, FIFA may choose to initiate formal investigations or disciplinary proceedings. This process will involve further examination of the incidents, interviewing relevant parties, and soliciting submissions from the concerned parties. 4. Impose sanctions: If the investigations conclude that there was indeed discriminatory chanting at the mentioned matches, FIFA will impose appropriate sanctions against individuals, teams, or associations according to its disciplinary code. 5. Raise awareness: FIFA will continue to work closely with organizations like the Fare network to promote diversity and inclusivity in football, and prevent future incidents of discrimination by educating fans and stakeholders about the detrimental effects of such behavior on the sport and its community. 6.

Movie plot title: Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Movie plot: Following the events of The New Blood, two graduating high school students are aboard on a houseboat. Jim tells his girlfriend Suzy the legend of Jason Voorhees, before playing a prank on her with a hockey mask and a fake knife. The boat sails over some underwater cables, which electrocute Jason's corpse and cause his resurrection. He sneaks on board and kills Jim with a harpoon gun before impaling Suzy, who tries to hide from him, with a barb. The next morning, the SS Lazarus is ready to set sail for New York City with a graduating senior class from Lakeview High School and chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen. Van Deusen brings McCulloch's niece Rennie along for the trip despite her aquaphobia much to his chagrin. Jason sneaks on board and kills rock star wannabe J.J. with her guitar before hiding in the bowels of the ship. That night, after a boxing match, a young boxer who lost to champion Julius Gaw is killed when Jason slams a hot sauna rock into his abdomen while Rennie, searching for her pet Border Collie Toby, discovers prom queen Tamara and Eva doing drugs. McCulloch nearly catches them moments later and Tamara pushes Rennie overboard, suspecting she told on them. She then uses video student Wayne to record McCulloch in a compromising situation with her, but rejects Wayne's advances afterward. Tamara is killed by Jason with a shard of broken mirror when she goes to take a shower. Rennie begins seeing visions of a young Jason throughout the ship, but the others ignore the deckhand's warnings that Jason is aboard. Jason kills Captain Robertson and his first mate. Rennie's boyfriend, Sean, discovers them and tells the others before calling for an emergency stop. Eva is strangled as she tries to flee from Jason.

Using rhyming and even melodies can help you remember facts. By incorporating rhythm or the tune of a simple song into your memorization you can also help your understanding of how key events, people, dates, etc. fit together. The old saying “In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,” is a great example of how rhyming can help commit information to your long-term memory. By taking the first letter of a series of related key words and using to invent a silly and memorable phrase, you can recall things in a specific order. This can be especially useful when trying to remember things in the order in which they happened. For example, \\"Gill Underestimated Cliff’s Strength” is a mnemonic for remembering who the main Allied powers were during World War II: Great Britain, the United States, China and the Soviet Union. If you study while smelling a certain notable scent (like rosemary, for example), and then use that scent later when you need to recall the material, studies suggest you’ll have a greater recall ability. Similarly, studying while listening to calm music can help you recall the material again later. When trying to commit a fact to memory, try to associate it with an image in your head. It may even help to draw the image out if you are a really visual learner. The image doesn’t necessarily have to be direct in its meaning. For example, if trying to learn facts about the Boston Tea Party, you might picture a Red Sox mug filled with hot tea. Associate different historical facts, events or phrases with a different part of your home in the order that you would normally walk through it. For example, to remember the outbreak of World War I associate the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie the Duchess of Hohenberg on June 28, 1914 with your front door. Visualize your entryway to your house in relationship to the fact that Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the killings and declared war on July 28, 1914. An ancient memorization technique, the loci method has you construct a \\"memory palace\\" using a building you know well (like your home). If trying to remember a chain of historical events, you might associate the first event with the front door to your home, the second with the entryway, the third with your living room, etc.","completion":"The article emphasizes the use of various memory-enhancing techniques such as rhyming, melodies, mnemonics, notable scents, calm music, visual associations, and the loci method to improve information retention and recall for facts, dates, and events."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His role briefly made him a billionaire. After serving a brief prison term in Colombia, he was arrested and extradited to the US in 1999 and is serving a 30 year term in US federal prison.

They first came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music, but their second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music and established them as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \\"landmark\\" and \\"one of the first successful concept albums\\". The band became known internationally with singles including \\"Go Now\\", \\"Nights in White Satin\\", \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\", and \\"Question\\". In the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of Higher & Higher magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage MCs (as the 1969 \\"Caught Live + 5\\" album displayed). Before the band's 1973-74 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \\"Island\\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest. In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year. Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \\"Blue Guitar\\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \\"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise.\\" Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed up in later years by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998); Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976).

Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms.

When a plant or animal dies, it breaks down and becomes like 'food' for the trees and plants. This is done by tiny creatures called decomposers.

Explanation: To add coolant to your car, you need to wait until the car is cool so you don't get burned. If the coolant is low, you can take off the cap on the coolant reservoir and use a funnel to add a mix of coolant and water (half and half) until it reaches the fill line.

The district encompasses 266.08 mi2 of land in Lawrence, Independence, and Sharp counties and serves portions of Strawberry, Evening Shade, Poughkeepsie, Smithville, Williford, Cave City, Ravenden, Black Rock, Imboden, Saffell, Lynn, and Powhatan. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Arkansas has a school district called Hillcrest.","completion":"Yes, based on the paragraph, we can indeed confirm the sentence \\"Arkansas has a school district called Hillcrest.\\" The first sentence of the paragraph states that \\"Hillcrest School District is a school district based in Strawberry, Arkansas, United States.\\" This sentence directly confirms the claim made in your sentence because it identifies Hillcrest School District as a school district located in Arkansas. Not only is the district based in Arkansas, but explicitly within the city of Strawberry. The paragraph also provides additional details about the Hillcrest School District, mentioning that it oversees a large area of land across several counties - Lawrence, Independence, and Sharp. This information adds further credence to the notion of Hillcrest being a substantial school district within Arkansas. Furthermore, the paragraph specifies several portions of Strawberry, Evening Shade, Poughkeepsie, Smithville, Williford, Cave City, Ravenden, Black Rock, Imboden, Saffell, Lynn, and Powhatan that Hillcrest School District serves, illustrating its wide-reaching influence within these regions of Arkansas. The mention of all these specific locations alludes to the extent and significance of Hillcrest School District within the Arkansas education system. Given these details, we can not only concur that Hillcrest is a school district located in Arkansas but also that it serves multiple communities across a large geographical area, making it a significant component of the state’s educational infrastructure. It's worth noting that the paragraph does not provide much detailed information about the quality of education or the specific number of schools or students within the Hillcrest School District. If you're interested in more specific information about the Hillcrest School District's performance, student populations, or its particular schools, that information would have to be searched separately. Still, there is no doubt regarding the existence and location of the Hillcrest School District in Arkansas based on the paragraph provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If Further assume, for simplicity, that our hypothetical couple's marginal tax rate is 28 percent, so their deduction costs the federal government 1,120 (28 percent of 4,000)., can we conclude that \\"The hypothetical couple's marginal tax rate is 28 percent.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided, yes, we can conclude that the hypothetical couple's marginal tax rate is 28 percent. The marginal tax rate is the percentage of an additional dollar of income that is taken away as income tax. In this case, we are given information about the couple's tax deduction and its cost to the federal government. Let's break down the information: 1. The couple has a tax deduction of 4,000. 2. Their marginal tax rate is assumed to be 28 percent. 3. The cost of their tax deduction to the federal government is 1,120, which is 28 percent of 4,000. The cost of a tax deduction to the federal government is calculated by finding the portion of the tax deduction that is not paid as tax due to the deduction's existence. In this example, the couple's 4,000 tax deduction results in 1,120 less paid in taxes. To get this number, you simply take the tax deduction amount (4,000) and multiply it by the marginal tax rate (28% or 0.28): 4,000 * 0.28 = 1,120 This implies that the couple would have paid 1,120 more in taxes without the 4,000 tax deduction. In this situation, the tax deduction reduces their taxable income and their tax liability by 28 percent of the tax deduction value, as per the given marginal tax rate. Thus, the statement \\"The hypothetical couple's marginal tax rate is 28 percent\\" is accurate based on the provided information. The couple faces a 28 percent tax rate on their additional income and benefits from a tax deduction that effectively reduces the amount they owe in taxes to the federal government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who is reminded of Kaecilius by Strange's arrogance and ambition? is inside the article: In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life., can you guess it ?

First, we want to bring all the \\"d\\" terms to one side. To do that, let's add 2 * d to both sides of the equation: -2 * d + 2 * d = 6 * d + 2 * d + 24 Which simplifies to: 0 = 8 * d + 24 2. Now, we want to get \\"d\\" all by itself. Let's remove the 24 by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 24 = 8 * d + 24 - 24 Which becomes: -24 = 8 * d 3.

Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate.

After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The user has asked to find the city in which Dimitri Malashenkov presented a paper explaining how Laika, the first dog in space, died based on the given article.

Greece was threatened with expulsion from the European Union for at least a decade if it dared to press ahead with a referendum on the single currency rescue deal, it emerged last night. On a day of drama worthy of the Greek stage, prime minister George Papandreou hovered between defying Brussels, resigning and forming a new government of national unity. A vote of confidence, expected at around 10pm tonight in the Greek parliament, could yet see the present government collapse. Threat: Angela Merkel, pictured with Barack Obama, has warned Greece not to reject the bailout package it was offered last week. Last night it was still not entirely clear what the Greek government has decided to do – though it is certain that Mr Papandreou has been cowed into calling off his proposed referendum. Extraordinary details then emerged of how German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened the Greeks not only with an end to bailout cash and ejection from the single currency, but also expulsion from the EU for at least ten years. But hopes in Brussels that a new coalition government led by someone other than Mr Papandreou could be installed were scuppered when the opposition insisted it would not join such an administration and instead demanded elections within six weeks. Mr Papandreou had horrified other EU leaders days ago by announcing that he would seek popular support for an agreement that would see half of Greece’s towering debts written off in return for a decade of deeply unpopular austerity measures. Pension payments are being slashed by 20 per cent, VAT has been hugely increased and a new property tax is being introduced. But economists argue the debt write-down is not dramatic enough to offer Greece any hope of emerging with a stronger economy. Defiant: Greece's prime minister George Papandreou speaking in parliament yesterday, when he insisted he was the right man for the job. Last night the Greek prime minister suggested he would be ready to drop a referendum on the bailout deal, as long as he could secure opposition support in Parliament. ‘If we had a consensus we wouldn’t have to go to a referendum,’ he said. ‘If the opposition is willing to negotiate then we are ready to ratify this deal and implement it.’ However, Mr Papandreou said the government was not afraid of asking the Greek people for their opinion in a referendum if necessary. Germany and France, fearing the single currency could collapse if the Greeks voted ‘no’, had already threatened to cut off existing cash lifelines for Athens until the vote was held. They also insisted any referendum must be on the country’s future membership of the EU and eurozone, rather than a more narrow question relating to deeply unpopular austerity measures, to maximise the chances of a ‘yes’ vote. And as the day went on, their threats escalated – culminating in the suggestion that Greece would not only have to ditch the euro and reinstate the drachma unless it supported the rescue deal, but also leave the EU. On his way out: Mr Papandreou leaving the G20 summit on Wednesday. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said Greece was ‘clearly going to fall out of the eurozone’. But former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling insisted the eurozone bailout deal had unravelled and said throwing Greece out of the single currency is ‘not going to solve the problem’. He said: ‘The real problem is that the Greek fix was never going to work. Even if it had worked, it was still going to be left with a debt of 120 per cent of its GDP and that doesn’t work. ‘The deal that they were being offered should never have been on the table.’ In a lengthy speech to the Greek parliament, Mr Papandreou declared: ‘For the last two years we have waged a battle of titanic proportions. Our first duty being to fend off bankruptcy, to prevent the country collapsing. We were a guinea pig in a monetary union. ‘We are bearing a cross and, on top of that, they are throwing stones at us.’ He attacked Mrs Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy for publicly humiliating Greece by ‘telling us how to hold our referendum, defining the rules’. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article discusses the political turmoil faced by Greece in 2011, as the nation was threatened with expulsion from the EU for a decade if it went ahead with a referendum on the single currency rescue deal. During this time, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou considered defying Brussels, resigning, and forming a new government of national unity. However, he eventually called off the proposed referendum under pressure from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who threatened Greece not only with the withdrawal of bailout cash and ejection from the single currency, but also expulsion from the EU for at least ten years. The article describes the financial struggles of Greece, including slashed pension payments, a new property tax, and increased VAT, and features opposing viewpoints from former UK Chancellor Alistair Darling, who believed the Greek fix was never going to work, and former UK Chancellor Lord Lawson, who stated that Greece would fall out of the eurozone. Ultimately, Papandreou's government faced a vote of confidence in the Greek parliament, which could have resulted in its collapse, while the opposition demanded elections within six weeks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.

One example of a growing city is Wooster, Ohio, my place of residency, Wooster in the last five years has grown considerably in population, leading to a growth in commercial business. Surrounded by farmland, Wooster's planning commission chose to extend the community into these farm areas in the form of residential and commercial areas. Picture this--corn fields, old trees, clean air, country roads, and wildlife are all part of the area. Within four years, the people living on this farm step outside on their front porch to view an extensive shopping center containing Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Wendy's, TCBY, and a Cinemark movie theatre. The once quiet road is now a city street with traffic lights, busy with automobiles day and night. The air smells of car exhaust and fast food. Some destruction of farmland is unavoidable when a city expands. Instead of expanding outward, planning commissions should consider interior _ of a city. Tearing down unusable buildings could remodel many areas inside the city. In addition, commercialized buildings could extend upwards to avoid unnecessary use of land. Environmentally, commercial expansion is harmful to the land. Besides forms of pollution, wildlife, including both plants and animals, is put at risk.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens?, using the article: York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\", what would be the answer ?

Please answer the following question: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious. Which team had people getting less oxygen to their cells? A:","completion":"Team two, which had people with sickle-cell anemia, had individuals getting less oxygen to their cells. This is due to the mutated hemoglobin in their red blood cells, which causes the cells to clump together and form a crescent shape.

We have a math problem that looks like this: 663 * m = 620 * m - 344 1. Let's first find out how many more \\"m's\\" we have on the left side compared to the right side. We can do this by subtracting 620 * m from both sides of the equation. So, 663 * m - 620 * m = 620 * m - 620 * m - 344 2. Now, let's simplify: 43 * m = -344 (The left side becomes 43 * m because 663 - 620 = 43 and the right side becomes -344 as 620 * m - 620 * m equals 0.) 3. To find the value of m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 43: 43 * m / 43 = -344 / 43 4. Again, let's simplify: m = -8 (On the left side, 43 * m / 43 becomes just m, and on the right side, -344 / 43 is -8.)

Summarize this article: The Commerce Department said gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual pace of 1.1% in the quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 0.8%. The upwards revision was helped by stronger export sales. However, growth in consumer spending was revised down to 1.5%, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2014. That weaker number was a reflection of slowing spending in service sectors such as health care and weak consumer spending during a harsh winter in many regions of the US. This is the third estimate of first-quarter US GDP by the Commerce Department, which said \\"the general picture of economic growth remains the same\\". The Commerce Department also revised upwards its estimate for the growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to an annualised pace of 1.4% The upward revision is a positive sign for growth in the current quarter, but there are concerns that the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union could send shockwaves through the US economy, slowing growth in the autumn. Economists currently expect second quarter growth in 2016 to be close to 2.4% Nariman Behravesh chief economist at IHS, said: \\"Consumers will resume their role as the powerhouse of the US economy, with personal consumption expenditures in the second quarter estimated to grow by 3.7%.\\"","completion":"The big people at the Commerce Department said that the money the United States makes (we call it GDP) grew a little more than they thought in one part of the year. People sold more things to other countries, and that's good. But, people in the United States didn't spend as much money on things like going to the doctor or buying stuff during a really cold winter. The people that know a lot about money think that people will start spending more money, and that will help the United States make even more money later this year. But, they are a little worried about something that happened in a far away place called the United Kingdom, which might make it harder for the United States to make more money later on."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy.

Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing. Viewing social justice as \\"fighting to get your way\\" instead of doing the right thing means what, according to the narrator? - a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles - not enough information - something sad - something life-changing","completion":"According to the narrator, viewing social justice as \\"fighting to get your way\\" instead of doing the right thing means that it is something sad. The narrator believes that the young woman and her family were focused on trying to secure her spot at UC Berkeley, even if it meant finding ways to bend the rules and using personal hardships as an excuse. The girl, whose potential was evident and who had much to offer the world, was being taught that seeking shortcuts and bending the rules were the ways to succeed in life. This perspective on social justice reflects a misunderstanding of its true meaning. Social justice should be about working towards a fair and equal society, where people are granted opportunities and support based on their merits instead of their background or personal circumstances. It is about addressing and overcoming systemic barriers that certain individuals or groups might face. The narrator also draws a contrast between this sad view of social justice and the inspiring resilience of other students dealing with difficult circumstances. The latter group, rather than seeking a way to avoid their challenges, finds solace and strength in education, using it as a means to cope with their troubles. These students understand that life will present them with hardships, but they choose to face them head-on, with the support of a nurturing and conducive educational environment. Ultimately, the narrator feels disheartened by the girl's story, recognizing that it represents a departure from the true meaning of social justice and a missed opportunity for her to grow and develop in ways that aligned with her potential."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Rozat \\"Rusty\\" Sabich (Harrison Ford) is a prosecutor and the right-hand man of District Attorney Raymond Horgan (Dennehy). When his colleague, Carolyn Polhemus (Greta Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty takes charge of the investigation. The election for District Attorney is approaching and Tommy Molto (Joe Grifasi), the acting head of the homicide division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia (Tom Mardirosian). Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had an affair with Carolyn. When he had shown little ambition, and would have therefore been of little use in advancing her career, Carolyn abruptly dumped him. He has since made up with his wife, Barbara (Bonnie Bedelia), but is still obsessed with Carolyn. Detective Greer (Tucker Smallwood) is initially in charge of the case, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer (John Spencer), whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon realizes that Tommy Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is Type Aâthe same as Rusty's. When Nico wins the election, he and Tommy accuse Rusty of the crime and push to get evidence against him. They have Rusty's fingerprints on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body.

The latest incident took place earlier this week, when a Chevy Equinox crashed through one of the walls, narrowly missing Leigh by just a few inches. At the time of the accident, she was watching the Colts game alongside her husband, Tim McCall, in their living room. Recounting the harrowing experience, Tim informed WTHR that he was incredulous at how something hadn't hit her. Thankfully, the most recent crash did not result in severe injuries. However, a previous collision at the same spot is alleged to have caused the death of a man, according to a spokesperson from the fire department who spoke to the Star. The frequent crashes seem to originate from a problematic railroad crossing situated approximately 150 feet away from the McCall home. In the most recent accident, the driver admitted to speeding when she traversed the railroad tracks. Consequently, she lost control of her vehicle, overcorrected, and ultimately barreled through the McCall's dining room (where most of the accidents have occurred) and into their living room. A local member of the Indiana General Assembly has noted a pattern in these collisions, suggesting that drivers might be attempting to race against the train when crossing the tracks. Tim McCall agrees with this speculation and elucidates that vehicles tend to go airborne after crossing the tracks due to the elevated terrain in that area. Leigh's mother inhabits the other side of the duplex, which is also shared by the McCall couple. The trio has been relentlessly advocating for the installation of a stop sign near the perilous tracks to prevent further accidents from occurring. Implementing a strategic traffic control measure like this could enhance the safety of the area and potentially save lives in the future. As it stands, the neighborhood's residents remain vulnerable to unexpected vehicular accidents that could result in property damage, injury, or even death."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.telegram.messenger.

The documents that disappeared: how a furious CIA-Senate row erupted Dianne Feinstein has displayed no great enthusiasm for intelligence agency whistleblowers: only last June, she said leaks by Edward Snowden amounted to an “act of treason”. Yet it was with no sense of irony that the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, in an extraordinary address on the floor of the US Senate, revealed that documents at the heart of the collapse of her committee’s relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency might have been provided surreptitiously by someone who wanted her staffers to find them. The documents are known as the “internal Panetta review”, after the former CIA director who presumably ordered them. How they came into the hands of staff members working for Senate select committee on intelligence is a story of intrigue and double-dealing worthy of the agency itself. The review was a sensitive, internal assessment of the CIA’s detention and interrogation program, which included techniques such as water-boarding that most experts say amounts to torture. So furious was the CIA to have lost control of the set of documents it believed should never have become public, it is thought to have been behind the anonymous briefers who told newspapers that congressional staff had obtained them by somehow hacking into its networks – a feat that would challenge even the most determined international cyber-terrorist. The review seems originally to have been intended for CIA eyes only, but according to Feinstein, it appeared in 2010 on the computer network established by the agency at a secret location in Virginia to facilitate an extensive investigation by her committee into post-9/11 interrogation techniques. It was just one in a remarkable series of events that culminated with a printed-out portion of the review being slipped out of the custody of the CIA to the US Capitol, where it now resides in a safe in a second-floor Senate building, as an expanding controversy explodes around it. The origins of the crisis in confidence between the CIA and the Senate intelligence committee can be traced back to December 2005, when about 100 videotapes recording the CIA’s torture of terrorist suspects were destroyed. Members of committee, kept in the dark about the CIA’s controversial interrogation and detention program, knew nothing of the destruction of video tapes until it was reported in the media, and were furious. After discussions with then CIA director Michael Hayden, the committee began an initial investigation. Shocked by its “chilling” findings, which went far beyond the CIA’s misleading account of its torture program, the committee agreed to initiate a far more expansive investigation, an endeavour that would take three years and culminate in a damning 6,300-page report, which has yet to be made public. From the start, the CIA was suspicious about the inquiry, and refused to allow documents to be made available to the committee in the normal way. Instead, a highly unusual system was devised – which lies at the centre of the battle now being waged between the committee and the CIA. The agency proposed that the committee’s work would be conducted in a kind of of no-man’s land, overseen but not interfered with by the agency. Around mid-2009, a secure office space was created somewhere in northern Virginia, away from CIA headquarters in Langley. This location, described by Feinstein as “a CIA-leased facility”, was staffed by CIA information technology personnel and guarded by the agency. Under the agreement, those IT staff – mostly contracted workers – were “not permitted” to share information with other CIA officials, Feinstein said. The full text of the CIA-Senate agreement has not been released, but according to Feinstein, the idea was that congressional staff would have access to CIA material, but conduct their work behind a kind of firewall, with their own “standalone computer system” and separate “network drive” that was “walled off” and “segregated from CIA networks”. Although they were working independently from the CIA, the Senate aides were nonetheless dependent upon the agency for the material that would form the basis of their investigation. Relevant CIA documents arrived having been vetted, several times over, by CIA contractors, hired to ensure the aides were not accidentally provided with the wrong documents. What began as a trickle of CIA operational cables, internal memos and emails, quickly turned into a flood of information appearing on their computer drives. In total, there were 6.2m pages of CIA documents loaded onto the computers accessed by the Senate staff. None of them were indexed, or provided in a way that would make them easy to comprehend. The agency did, however, provide the congressional staff with a search tool, allowing them to use search terms to find and locate relevant material. “It was a true ‘document dump’ that our committee staff had to go through and make sense of,” Feinstein said. The challenge of making sense of this huge repository of evidence was made significantly harder when the Senate staff realised some of the documents they had been authorised to view were disappearing. Almost 1,000 documents went missing from the computers in the CIA-guarded facility in February and May 2010, according to Feinstein. She said when committee staff complained about the disappearance of documents, CIA personnel initially denied any documents had been removed, then blamed IT contractors, and finally claimed – falsely – that the White House had ordered the removal of the documents. Faced with vanishing evidence, the committee staff tried to keep backups. Whenever they came across documents they thought were important, or likely to feature in their final report, they routinely printed off copies or saved duplicates to their computer. Still, the disappearance of documents was an alarming development, and the issue was brought up directly with the then-White House counsel. Seemingly, it was put to rest after the CIA apologised and promised to not access the committee’s network again or remove its documents. “And that, as far as I was concerned, put the incident aside,” Feinstein said. It was in the middle of 2010 that the committee’s staff said they made their most startling and significant discovery amid the millions of CIA documents. Staffers querying the CIA database found a tranche of documents, some marked “deliberative” or “privileged”, which together formed drafts of the so-called “internal Panetta review”. It was kind of a shadow report, produced by CIA officials, apparently for the agency’s then director, Leon Panetta. Anonymous sources quoted in media reports have suggested the staff members may have entered the CIA’s networks without authorisation and obtained the material illegally – an allegation Feinstein strongly denies. “To be clear, the committee staff did not ‘hack’ into CIA computers to obtain these documents, as has been suggested in the press,” she told the Senate, adding: “We don’t know whether the documents were provided intentionally by the CIA, unintentionally by the CIA, or intentionally by a whistleblower.” Either way, the documents were an explosive find: here was the CIA’s own internal assessment of its controversial interrogation techniques used against terrorist detainees. According to Feinstein, the internal Panetta review was “written by CIA personnel to summarise and analyse the materials that had been provided to the committee for its review”. In other words, it was an assessment of the evidence being combed through by committee staff, and the conclusions that might be drawn, which included “acknowledgement of significant CIA wrongdoing”, Feinstein said. The CIA has not confirmed why the review was ordered, or by whom. It took place in 2009 and 2010 and may have been partly connected to what was then an ongoing criminal investigation into torture by a Justice Department official. In any case, the Senate staff printed copies and made electronic backups of the Panetta review, realising it was an important find. Still, the full significance of the documents would not become apparent for another three years. The work of the Senate team of staffers continued until December 2012, when the intelligence committee approved their huge study. The 6,300-page report into the CIA was a huge achievement, achieved through years of painstaking work – Feinstein said it was the most detailed and comprehensive report in the history of the Senate. It has yet to be made public, although the Senate committee is pushing for the findings, conclusions and the executive summary to be declassified by the White House in the coming months. When finally released, the report is expected to give a scathing indictment of the CIA’s detention and interrogation of terror suspects; providing a glimpse of the report’s findings on Tuesday, Feinstein described the CIA’s program as “un-American” and “brutal”. However, the CIA rejects many of the committee’s findings, and made its intentions clear in an official response to the committee in June 2013. That formal rebuttal from the CIA was a significant turning point. According to Feinstein, the CIA formally disputed “important parts” of the committee’s findings that are “clearly acknowledged” in the Panetta review. “How can the CIA’s official response to our study stand factually in conflict with its own internal review?” she asked. Crucially, this review, an essential tool in the impending battle against the CIA, was among the 1,000 documents that had been mysteriously “removed” from the committee’s computers. It was only after realising the discrepancy between the CIA’s official response and the Panetta review that congressional aides moved to ensure they had their own copy in a safe place. Conscious that the CIA had destroyed videos of past interrogations and removed documents from their computers, they decided to take a printed portion of the Panetta review out of the CIA facility in northern Virginia, without clearing it with the CIA, as was required under the arrangement agreed for their investigation. Important questions remain unanswered. Did the congressional staff decide themselves to take the document without the CIA knowing? Did they seek approval? Were senators, up to and including Feinstein, aware of the decision to take the document from the CIA facility in apparent breach of the agreement? Feinstein did not elaborate in her statement. Whatever happened, the document appears to have been sneaked out, without the CIA’s knowledge, some time between 27 June 2013 and 15 January 2014. Feinstein said the document was removed to the Hart Senate Office Building to “preserve and protect” crucial evidence she implied might otherwise have been disappeared by the CIA. “No law prevents the relocation of a document in the committee’s possession from a CIA facility to secure committee offices on Capitol Hill,” she said, adding that the document was redacted, transported safely and secured with restricted access. Still, the senator’s critics point out that squirrelling secret information out of the custody of a powerful and distrusted intelligence agency is not entirely distinct from the theft, months before, by Snowden from an NSA base in Hawaii. It was two months ago that the issue culminated in a confrontation between Feinstein and the current CIA director, John Brennan. Her committee, which only had a printed portion of the Panetta review in its possession, had formally requested the full report from the CIA. The agency refused to hand it over. According to Feinstein, Brennan informed her at a meeting on 15 January that, after concluding that the committee may have gained unauthorised access to the review, CIA personnel had conducted a “search” of the committee’s computers. The search revealed Senate aides had indeed accessed the confidential report, and Brennan said he planned further “forensic” investigation of the committee’s computers. Feinstein and other senators on the committee were furious at what they argue was the CIA overstepping its constitutional powers by conducting an unauthorised, potentially criminal search of their staff computers. They perceived the CIA’s actions as nothing less than a potentially unlawful monitoring of their staff, gravely undermining the separation of powers that divides the legislative and executive branches of government. Feinstein has since written twice to Brennan, objecting to further CIA investigations, seeking an apology and demanding answers to 12 questions about how the agency came to inspect the computers. Days after the head-to-head meeting, the CIA’s inspector general, David Buckley, began his own investigation. According to Feinstein, Buckley then referred the matter to the Department of Justice. By early March, the controversy was starting to emerge from the shadows. Senator Mark Udall, a veteran of combat against the intelligence community, had written an open letter to Obama, requesting his support and making clear the White House knew about the controversy. When Brennan appeared before an open hearing of the Senate intelligence committee, the CIA director’s comments were veiled and somewhat cryptic, but spoke to a seething resentment at the agency. “I am deeply dismayed that some members of the Senate have decided to make spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts,” Brennan said, intimating that the “legislative branch” may be the guilty party. On Tuesday, Brennan denied that the CIA was responsible for “hacking” into Senate staff computers, but did not specifically address whether the agency had gained unauthorised access to their machines. In an intriguing twist, CIA officials might not be the only individuals facing criminal investigations. According to Feinstein, the acting general counsel of the CIA filed a crimes report to the Justice Department relating to actions by Senate intelligence committee members. Feinstein cast this move as an act of intimidation by the CIA, pointing out that the acting general counsel, who she did not name but is known to be Robert Eatinger, is heavily implicated in her committee’s report. Before becoming general counsel of the CIA, Eatinger was “chief lawyer” of the very same counter-terrorism unit responsible for the agency’s interrogation and detention program and, Feinstein added, his name “is mentioned more than 1,600 times” in her committee’s report. The Democratic senator conceded she did not know the details of the allegations made by Eatinger against her staff. They could refer to the claims – denied by Feinstein – that her staff hacked into the agency’s computers to obtain the Panetta review. The allegations could also relate to the report’s removal from the CIA facility, a manoeuvre Feinstein has not denied, but argues was both lawful and justified to overcome an agency determined to escape the accountability. Feinstein’s dramatic intervention on the floor of the US Senate has blown wide open a battle that had previously been simmering beneath the surface. The unseemly fight between the CIA and a Senate committee mandated to hold it to account will now be fought on several fronts, including in the media, where there has been a cascade of leaks from both sides. The CIA’s inspector general is conducting an inquiry into the agency’s allegedly unconstitutional searches of congressional staff computers, likely to take months to conclude. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice will be deliberating two competing sets of claims that allege criminal wrongdoing by both the CIA and Senate staff. The department’s decision about whether to lodge criminal charges in the affair – and, in which case, against whom – will be a crucial moment. In the shorter term, attention is likely to fall on the White House, which has studiously avoided becoming embroiled, in public at least, in a controversy that harks back to the post 9/11 years of George W Bush. Obama ended the CIA detention program when he came into office and declared its interrogation technique amounted to torture. Now he will need to decide how much of the Senate’s excoriating report into the program should be made public – and when. That is as much a political choice as it is a legal one. Obama must pick between his hand-picked CIA director and the powerful chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee whose support he needs to ensure the smooth passage of limited reforms he proposes to that other problematic clandestine organisation: the National Security Agency.

Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. What is an answer for this question: Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous? Answer:","completion":"Jeremy is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous. This is because he works on a construction site where he operates a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines generate high-decibel sounds, which have greater intensity and loudness. As explained earlier, for every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, the loudness becomes 10 times greater. Exposure to high-decibel sounds is dangerous as it can damage the ears and cause hearing loss. On the other hand, Alexander works in a library where he is exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels. Lower decibel levels are generally not dangerous to human ears and don't typically cause hearing damage.

Van Thy says the government evicted her from her home in the Cambodian capital and trucked her and others out to a town an hour away where she now lives in a hot green metal shed with no running water and dim prospects. Many Cambodian AIDS patients and their families have been relocated to this community outside Tuol Sambo. Before the move, she had a job as a dishwasher, but now the 36-year-old woman is unemployed, penniless and her health has taken a turn for the worse. She has AIDS like many of the others in the 40 AIDS-affected families that were resettled here. \\"We were called for a meeting and when I got there, a lot of trucks were already prepared. There was no meeting. They told us to prepare our stuff for moving out,\\" she said, her voice trembling as she detailed her departure from the Phnom Penh shantytown she called home for nine years. \\"Everybody cried the day we left.\\" As Cambodia emerges from the 1970s Khmer Rouge genocide and decades of conflict, evictions for development purposes have become a hot issue, with rights groups and upset villagers living on desirable land launching protests in recent years. But what sets the families apart at Tuol Sambo is that they have AIDS. \\"The problems that this community face are not unlike problems that people face throughout the country,\\" said Kathleen O'Keefe, an independent consultant focusing on HIV/AIDS and land issues. \\"What has made these problems extreme is that they have been isolated and treated as a community\\" and their relocation has added \\"additional problems, like real health risks of many immune compromised people living far too close together. This place would be a health risk to healthy people.\\" This is the second relocation for many of these families. They had been living in a shantytown in the Cambodian capital, an area called Borei Keila that was across the street from a hospital where they received medical care and where they could find jobs to earn 1.25 or 1.50 a day. O'Keefe said they had lived dispersed throughout the community but were forced to move into one building there in 2007 when the area started to undergo development. \\"They were segregated into a green building, which very quickly became known as the ... AIDS village,\\" O'Keefe said. \\"This AIDS colony in Tuol Sambo is the second time they are being even further isolated ... it's been an extremely traumatic situation for them.\\" O'Keefe said most of the families that were moved to Tuol Sambo told her they have lost their jobs, their health is worsening due to a lack of clean water and food, and they face discrimination from their new neighbors because of their illness. \\"We feel very ashamed to go outside, they look like they [are] discriminating against us,\\" Van Thy said. Phnom Penh Deputy Governor Mann Chhoeun said those who were relocated got a plot of land, a house and 275. He also noted they were provided rice, electricity and said, \\"when the water supply can be connected to this area, then we can connect it for these people.\\" Mann Chhoeun said the people were illegally squatting in the Phnom Penh shantytown, but they were not forcefully evicted. \\"They proposed to go ... because living in that area (their previous shantytown) they had floods and they have no proper business to do in there, so that's why they proposed to us to go there,\\" he said. \\"They think that when they go there (to Tuol Sambo), they can own the land, they can own a house and they can make some business or something like that.\\" He also said he did not believe there was discrimination in the area, \\"but there is some feeling when they (people) learn that someone has been living with HIV/AIDS.\\" Van Thy said her new home has brought many challenges and a recent blood test showed that her CD4 count -- a marker of decreased immune function that is often used to demonstrate how well anti-HIV drugs are working, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had gone down. She said the doctor told her she needed to eat more, but she said having little money means eating less: \\"It means that my health is getting worse,\\" she said. The water in their new home is from a well and is undrinkable unless it is boiled or purified. \\"We are patients, we need some clean water,\\" she said. \\"They said the water cannot be drunk, just for using to wash clothes and things like that.\\" Another man, Chheang Toma, takes the temperature inside his green shed at noon every day. On average, it is 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) but one time spiked up to 50 Celsius (122). \\"This area is very difficult,\\" he said. \\"I am always sick, and I always have a headache. The weather is so hot even my son has gone to the clinic two times already.\\" Home care specialist, Oum Vicheth, has been working with this community since 1998 and holds a clinic at Tuol Sambo once a week. He said the move \\"has strongly affected them.\\" \\"This is a long-term effect, not a short-term one, because medicine alone cannot help them. It combines with other factors like food, eating enough, sleeping enough and a good environment, so all this can help make their health stable,\\" he said. \\"The problem is right now that what these people are facing is about their food, about their sleep and about the heat. It's very hot. Sometimes this affects the quality of the medicine they keep.\\" Chheang Toma said his son, who is in first grade, heard that parents of local children told them not to play with him because he has HIV. \\"He just told me that he wanted to play with those children but when they saw him they just run away,\\" he said. \\"I know right now some parents they just learning and understand about us, and they start to tolerate, but some others keep us in isolation -- like they still look at us, treating us very bad by not coming very close and not making friends with us.\\" Oum Vicheth said he was providing health care to the villagers as a way to bring them closer to the group, and they have held meetings with them about how HIV is contracted. \\"There was very little thought given to integrating the community into the larger resettlement area of Tuol Sambo,\\" said Tony Lisle, the UNAIDS country coordinator for Cambodia. \\"By basically settling the community in one contiguous place it opens the community up to discrimination.\\" The U.N. team in Cambodia also \\"was disappointed that the relocation was carried out before the site was made habitable\\" and monitors would visit the site in late August, Lisle said. Teng Kunthy, secretary-general of the Cambodian government's National AIDS Authority, said the Tuol Sambo group's worries were about the housing, not their health care, since he said they still had good access to treatment, including home-based care, medicine and the help of charities. He said the housing situation could not be changed overnight, but it would improve \\"step by step,\\" and he also noted Tuol Sambo was an area the municipality wants to develop. \\"The municipality has a plan for the future,\\" he said. \\"I asked the government to explain to them (the Tuol Sambo residents), to provide more information to them.\\" He also noted there was \\"no serious discrimination\\" in Cambodia against people with HIV/AIDS, but that the AIDS authority would try to ensure any such problems did not arise in the future. Back at Tuol Sambo, people think of the future and how they will make ends meet. One man in the community who has AIDS lost one job in the move but still has part-time work.

Hypothesis: The people are playing outdoors. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Given the premise provided, it cannot be concluded that the group of people are playing outdoors since the premise takes place indoors, specifically in a mall or train station. First, let's analyze the premise. The premise describes a group of people walking through a mall or train station. As indoor public spaces, malls and train stations provide specific purposes. Malls serve as commercial centers offering a variety of retail stores, restaurants, and leisure activities. Meanwhile, train stations are transportation hubs facilitating the movement of passengers between different trains, railways, and connecting transport options like buses or taxis. In both cases, these spaces aren't typically associated with outdoor activities or play. They are primarily constructed for ease of accessibility, functionality, and the intended purpose of either shopping or traveling, respectively. The actions taking place in these settings would more likely be associated with browsing, purchasing, commuting, waiting, or simply moving between one area to another. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the people in question are playing outdoors. This statement contradicts the premise since outdoor environments entail open-air natural or recreational spaces, such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, or even spacious backyards. These areas are specifically designed or chosen for outdoor activities and play, which involve physical exertion, recreational sports, or other types of leisure activities. Experiencing fresh air, sunlight, and nature is a significant aspect of outdoor locations and activities, setting them apart from indoor spaces like malls or train stations. Since these different settings are distinctly separate, it is not possible to conclude the hypothesis from the given premise. The group of people walking through a mall or train station is an indoor-based activity and not indicative of outdoor play. Moreover, the premise and hypothesis describe two contrasting environments and purposes, making it implausible to logically conclude that the people are playing outdoors based on the provided scenario."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: Who does Charley kill that returns the victims human again?

Question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose If healthy eating habits are practiced happens, how will it affect The liver will have bigger amounts of fat to process. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of practicing healthy eating habits can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's processes. Direct effects: 1. Reduced toxin exposure: Healthy eating habits often involve consuming fewer processed foods and artificial additives, which may reduce the overall burden of toxins entering the bloodstream. This can potentially make it easier for the liver to detoxify the blood. 2. Improved nutrient intake: Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of essential vitamins and minerals can improve the liver's ability to process those nutrients into usable forms for the rest of the body. Indirect effects: 1. Weight management: Healthy eating habits can help maintain a healthy body weight, which in turn reduces the risk of developing fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease occurs when fat accumulates in the liver, causing inflammation and impairing its function. By promoting healthy weight maintenance, the liver is less likely to be burdened with excessive fat, allowing it to function more efficiently. 2. Prevention of liver diseases: Eating a nutritious diet can help prevent liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatitis, which can otherwise damage the liver and impair its ability to perform its various functions. In conclusion, practicing healthy eating habits can positively affect the liver's processes by reducing the burden of toxins, improving nutrient intake, helping maintain a healthy weight, and preventing liver diseases. This can enhance the liver's ability to effectively perform its functions, including processing and managing fat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Polish troops then occupied northern Orava and Spiš on 17 July 1945. There were armed clashes and fatalities in some villages over the following two years. Slovaks from the Polish part of Spiš settled mainly in the newly created industrial town of Svit near Poprad, Kežmarok, Poprad, and in depopulated German villages near Kežmarok. Slovaks from the Polish part of Orava settled mainly in Czech Silesia, and in depopulated German villages in the Czech lands . On 10 March 1947 a treaty guaranteeing basic rights for Slovaks in Poland was signed between Czechoslovakia and Poland. As a result, 41 Slovak basic schools and 1 high school were opened in Poland. Most of these however were shut down in the early sixties because of lack of Slovakian teachers. On June 13, 1958, in Warsaw, the two countries signed a treaty confirming the border at the line of January 1, 1938 , and since then there have been no conflicts regarding this matter.

You will also need at least 12 ash or basswood saplings that are 15 feet (4.5 meters) tall and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick for the horizontal hoops. The saplings need to be straight as possible. Ash and basswood are the most traditional, but you can use other hardwoods, such as: cedar, chestnut, elm, or hickory. If you are making a model, use thin, bendy twigs instead. You can also use wire instead. Florist's wire coated in brown paper would work well. Start by trimming off any bark and branches. This will help reduce wood rot and help the wigwam last longer. Next, cut the ends of the saplings into points. This will make it easier to insert them into the holes. Make your poles extra-strong by hardening the pointy ends in a fire. This will also help them last longer once you drive them into the soil. If the saplings aren't flexible enough, soak them in a lake or river for at least two days first. Be sure to tie them down so that they don't float away. Gather 50 bushels of cattail leaves. A bushel is a bundle that is thick enough to wrap your arms around. Separate the cattails into 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) thick bundles. Secure each bundle at one end with some string. Set them out in the sun to dry. If you don't have access to cattails, you can use heavy canvas, which was used to cover wigwams from the late 1700s onwards. You will need 12 to 14 sheets that are 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters). If you want to be more traditional, you can sew cattail leaves into large mats. Plan on using 12 to 14 mats, each 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters).

How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot.

Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times.

Given the background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. and the situation: Guyana and Nigeria had thriving economies. Guyana's economy was based on conventional agriculture, while Nigeria attracted an enormous number of tourists to its splendid beaches each year. Answer the following question: Which country caused more marine debris? The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is difficult to definitively determine which country, Guyana or Nigeria, caused more marine debris without data on the specific waste generation and disposal practices of each country. However, we can discuss some factors that may influence the amount of marine debris produced by each country based on their economic activities and general trends observed in similar situations. Guyana's economy is primarily based on conventional agriculture, which can contribute to marine pollution through the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other agrochemicals. These chemicals can leach into water sources, such as rivers and streams, and eventually make their way into the ocean. The runoff from agriculture can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones, as mentioned in the background information provided. Additionally, agriculture can also be a source of solid waste, such as discarded packaging materials, which may also find their way into the marine environment. In contrast, Nigeria's economy relies heavily on tourism, particularly along its coastlines. Tourism can contribute to marine debris in several ways. Firstly, the infrastructure needed to support the industry, such as hotels, restaurants, and other facilities, generates waste materials that may be improperly disposed of or inadequately managed, resulting in pollution entering the marine environment. Additionally, the large number of tourists visiting the beaches increases the likelihood of littering and leaving behind waste materials that can be washed out to sea or accumulate along coastlines. Based on these factors, it is quite possible that Nigeria, with its heavy reliance on coastal tourism, may generate a higher volume of marine debris compared to Guyana. The rapid influx of tourists and potentially insufficient waste management infrastructure could result in increased amounts of waste materials entering the marine environment. However, this is not to say that Guyana does not contribute to marine pollution; the agriculture-based economy can also contribute significantly, depending on their farming practices and waste management systems. To conclusively determine which country causes more marine debris, a detailed comparative analysis of the waste generation, disposal practices, and marine pollution levels in both countries would be necessary. This would entail collecting data on the sources and types of waste produced, the effectiveness of local waste management systems, and the concentration of marine debris in their respective coastal and offshore waters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"In order to make a caramel to eat with Nutella mousse, you can follow one of the following methods: Method 1: Classic caramel sauce Ingredients: - 1 cup granulated sugar - 1/4 cup water - 1/2 cup heavy cream (room temperature) - 1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick, room temperature) - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional) - Pinch of salt (optional) Instructions: 1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Mix them gently until the sugar is evenly moistened. Don't make sugar clumps. 2. Over medium heat, cook the sugar mixture without stirring until it reaches a golden amber color. The cooking process should take around 8-10 minutes, but it can vary depending on your heat source and the saucepan's thickness. Keep a close watch to prevent caramel from burning. 3. While the sugar cooks, warm the heavy cream in a separate saucepan or microwave. This will help ensure a smoother caramel sauce. 4. Once the sugar has reached a golden amber color, remove it from the heat and carefully add the warmed heavy cream slowly. The mixture will bubble and steam, so be careful not to burn yourself. Whisk the mixture until it's smooth and well combined. 5. Add the unsalted butter to the caramel sauce, stirring it until thoroughly combined. 6. If desired, add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Allow the caramel sauce to cool for a few minutes before serving with the Nutella mousse. Method 2: Nutella caramel sauce Ingredients: - 1 cup granulated sugar - 1/4 cup water - 1/2 cup heavy cream (room temperature) - 1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick, room temperature) - 1/2 cup Nutella - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional) - Pinch of salt (optional) Instructions: 1. Follow the instructions of Method 1 to create the basic caramel sauce (steps 1-5). 2. Once you've added the unsalted butter, slowly mix the Nutella into the sauce until it's fully incorporated and smooth. 3. If desired, add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. 4. Allow the Nutella caramel sauce to cool for a few minutes before serving with the Nutella mousse. Both methods will allow you to create a delicious caramel sauce to enjoy with your Nutella mousse. The classic caramel sauce (Method 1) offers a traditional, rich caramel flavor that will complement the Nutella mousse, while the Nutella caramel sauce (Method 2) intensifies the hazelnut and chocolate flavors.

The premise states that two heavy smokers have managed in three months to make the rest of the building smell because of their smoking habits. This suggests that smoking can cause a noticeable odor in the surrounding environment. 2. Given that the rest of the building now smells due to the heavy smokers, it appears that at least some residents (or people in the building) are aware of the odor caused by smoking. There must be a noticeable change in the environment for others in the building to be affected by it. 3. The hypothesis states \\"Everyone knows that smoking does not leave an odor.\\" This statement is in direct contrast to the premise, as the premise proves there is an odor associated with heavy smoking in a shared space. Consequently, the premise does not support the hypothesis. Instead, it refutes it by illustrating that smoking can, in fact, leave an odor in a shared environment. It is highly likely that at least some individuals in the building are aware that smoking creates an odor, which goes against the hypothesis that \\"Everyone knows that smoking does not leave an odor.\\""},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"The review provided is definitely negative. The reviewer expresses a high level of dissatisfaction with the product in question. The review contains several cues that indicate that it is negative. Firstly, the title of the review, \\"Horrible release\\", indicates a negative opinion. \\"Horrible\\" is a strong word that conveys a high degree of dislike or dissatisfaction. This immediately sets a negative tone for the rest of the review. The reviewer then proceeds to express frustration with the fact that they have to stop halfway through the movie to switch discs. This inconvenience leads them to voice their dissatisfaction and affirms the negative sentiment introduced in the title. They then express regret over their inability to get a refund from Best Buy because once a DVD is opened, it cannot be returned. The disappointment at the lack of return options reinforces the negative tone of the review. The reviewer suggests not buying the DVD which is clear and direct advice fueled by overall discontent with the product. This sentiment is further cemented when the reviewer repeatedly advises potential buyers against purchasing the DVD. The line \\"Do not buy, do not buy, I can't say it enough. Do not buy...\\" demonstrates the reviewer's attempt to prevent others from experiencing the same disappointments they have with this product. Finally, the reviewer also suggests a potential only use of the product to be for disc storage which is quite undermining for the product, suggesting it is worthless aside from its physical properties.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the court that exiled people?, using the article: Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The name of the court that exiled people is the Palladion. In the 4th century BC, a suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court that dealt with cases involving the shedding of blood and religious pollution due to the act of killing. This court was responsible for prosecuting individuals for serious crimes, such as the murder of a slave, as mentioned in the article. It is important to note that in ancient Athens, slaves had limited judicial rights and were generally treated differently than free citizens. While citizens could be fined for misdemeanors, slaves would be subjected to physical punishment, such as flogging. However, there were certain protections in place for slaves, as excessively mistreating a slave could result in prosecution by any citizen on the grounds of avoiding violent excess (hubris). The Palladion court played a vital role in determining the consequences of serious crimes, including those committed against slaves. Since slaves were considered property and valuable assets, the court would ensure that the offenders were held accountable for their actions, ultimately contributing to maintaining social order and upholding the values of Athenian society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

News article: Mark Zuckerberg’s book club is off to a pretty lame start When Mark Zuckerberg invited 30 million people to his brand-new book club on Jan. 2, the Internet reacted hysterically: Sales of his first book pick, Moisés Naím’s “The End of Power,” skyrocketed overnight, jumping into Amazon’s top 10 books from its previous rank of 45,140th. The Atlantic predicted that the book club presaged some kind of big move into commerce. At the New Yorker and the New York Post and everywhere in between, pundits prepared to anoint Zuck “the new Oprah.” But the new Oprah he is not. See, when Zuckerberg actually hosted the first book club “meeting” — a Facebook Q&A yesterday with the book’s author, Moises Naím — he faced a problem familiar to far more plebeian bookclubs: Hardly anybody showed up. (And of those who did, few had actually read the book.) “We’re kicking off our Q&A now with Moisés Naím, author of The End of Power,” advised whatever poor Facebook employee runs the “Year of Books” community page. “As a reminder, please keep all questions and comments relevant to the book.” Among the 137 “questions” that followed: several requests for a pirated PDF of the book, a conspiracy theory involving Saudi social media and the price of oil and a photo of a Maltese wearing a frilly dress, along with many more on-topic, but still fairly stupid, questions. “Didn’t get the book yet,” one user commented, in fairly typical fashion, “but it definitly [sic] looks interesting.” To be fair, of course, there were also a few provocative, thoughtful questions from people who are clearly really interested in sweeping political trends, and there was some valuable — if brief, and rather shallow — discussion about topics like religion and money and war. That said: 137 questions? A mere 240 comments?! All told, fewer than 200 people participated in the chat, despite widespread media coverage and the popularity of Zuckerberg’s own Facebook page. To put those measly numbers in perspective, The Washington Post has published eight Facebook posts in the past eight hours that got that much interaction, if not much, much more. So what exactly is going wrong in Zuck’s much-touted club? Both the book and the pace of the book club may have something to do with it: “The End of Power,” while well-reviewed, isn’t exactly a sexy beach read. (“From boardrooms to battlefields and churches to states, being in charge isn’t what it used to be”!) It’s also 320 pages long, which means — since the club starts a new volume every two weeks — you’d have to read 23 pages each day to keep up. There is, however, another far more technical problem here — and that’s more interesting, for our purposes. Simply put, thanks to its ranking and filtering algorithms, Facebook just doesn’t make a good place for this type of Q&A. For starters, those algorithms guarantee that the transcript is hopelessly jumbled by default, ordered not chronologically (as it would be on Twitter) or by community votes (as it would be on Reddit), but by some more abstract and randomized measure of quality. The algorithms also mean that — though Zuckerberg advertised the book club to his 30 million followers, and though a quarter of a million people signed up for it — many of those people probably never saw the news of the Q&A with Naím in their feeds. Facebook had, in essence, hid its own news algorithmically. This is, of course, a problem that every publisher and user faces on Facebook — its whims are both all-powerful and unknown! — but it’s ironic to see Zuck himself suffer this way. Several club “members” even wrote that they would have participated in the inaugural book club “meeting,” but they didn’t know it was happening. “For some reason (algorithm?) this post only showed up in my notifications two hours after it was posted,” one woman complained. She had a good question for Naím, too: How will the power of algorithms change? Caitlin Dewey runs The Intersect blog, writing about digital and Internet culture.

Answer the above question based on the context below: At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as...

Article:","completion":"Title: Lincolnshire Health Trust Struggling with Hospital Consultant Shortage, Spends £20m on Emergency Cover Introduction The Lincolnshire health trust is tackling an ongoing challenge with a shortage of hospital consultants, leading to an expenditure of £20 million on emergency cover. Hospital consultants play a crucial role in patient care, especially in specialized areas of healthcare. Their diminished numbers are grappling healthcare institutions in Lincolnshire, ultimately resulting in suboptimal patient care and increased expenditures. Shortage of Hospital Consultants – The Crux of the Problem Hospital consultants are expert analysts responsible for overseeing patient care and are involved in a wide range of specialized medical fields, ranging from surgery to psychiatry. Their contribution to the healthcare system is invaluable in ensuring high-quality, effective treatment plans for patients. The shortage of these medical professionals in Lincolnshire has resulted in hospitals scrambling to find alternatives to ensure patient care is not compromised. Due to the lack of full-time hospital consultants, the health trust has been forced to spend a staggering £20 million to bring in emergency cover. This situation not only places immense strain on the existing healthcare resources but also impacts the overall quality of care provided to the patients. Emergency Cover – A Costly Solution To mitigate the deficit of hospital consultants, the Lincolnshire health trust is resorting to exorbitant measures – seeking emergency cover, which includes seeking temporary consultants through locum agencies or obtaining medical professionals from other regions. While this solution helps fill the immediate gaps in the medical workforce, there are various concerns surrounding this approach. Firstly, the cost of emergency cover is notably higher than regular employee wages. By spending £20 million on emergency cover, the health trust is inevitably redirecting resources away from other crucial areas of patient care. The financial burden placed on the healthcare system due to the consultant shortage is detrimental to the overall health of the community that relies on these services. Secondly, the use of temporary consultants may not guarantee the same level of expertise and experience as full-time employees. While these healthcare professionals must be qualified to perform their duties, issues regarding consistency of care and the challenges of rapidly switching between different treatment settings can negatively impact patients' overall experience and healthcare outcomes. Possible Causes and Current Efforts The shortage of hospital consultants in Lincolnshire may be attributed to various factors, including budget constraints, limited training opportunities, and the challenges associated with attracting and retaining top talent in rural areas. Given the urgent need for change, it is essential to explore long-term solutions to this crisis. One approach to addressing this issue would be to increase the investment in training, mentorship, and professional development opportunities for medical graduates and professionals. By creating an attractive environment for potential consultants, the health trust might be able to draw and retain top-tier talent. Moreover, initiatives aimed at improving the overall working conditions, such as offering competitive salaries, improving workplace infrastructure, and providing access to the latest technology, could foster a supportive atmosphere and deter staff attrition. Conclusion The Lincolnshire health trust's struggle with the shortage of hospital consultants is a pressing concern with far-reaching implications. The temporary solutions, including the £20 million spent on emergency cover, may not be a sustainable strategy for addressing the issue. By examining and addressing the root causes of this shortage, the health trust can work toward creating a sustainable and high-quality healthcare system that meets the needs of its patients and staff. In conclusion, proactive measures must be taken to minimize the effects of the consultant shortage on the patients, medical staff, and the overall healthcare system. Future efforts should consider long-term solutions that address talent attraction, retention, and development to ensure that Lincolnshire's healthcare system will be capable of providing high-quality patient care in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Last updated at 9:08 AM on 17th January 2012. A YouGov poll found that 70 per cent of Labour voters believe Ed Miliband is not fit to become prime minister. After being deemed 'too ugly' to become prime minister, Ed Miliband has been dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people don't believe in him. The YouGov poll gives him his worst rating since winning the Labour leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him. The shedding of support continued today after a blogger and Labour activist started trending on Twitter when he posted an article about why he recently switched allegiance to the Conservatives. Luke Bozier, a party member for five years, wrote: 'At a time when the nation needs strong political leadership, Labour offers nothing. The poll carried out for the Sunday Times showed that fewer Labour voters believe Mr Miliband is performing well compared to those who think he is doing a job. He received an overall rating of -3 points compared to David Cameron's 91 and Nick Clegg's 45 from Lib Dems. Further rubbing salt into the wounds, most people said they believe his elder brother, David, would do a better job but he has ruled out standing again. An MP was quoted by the newspaper as saying: '[David Miliband] said fratricide is one thing, double fratricide is quite another. It would destroy the party and [the brothers'] relationship.' In a scathing attack on the Labour party, blogger Luke Bozier trended on Twitter after switching allegiance. He has the right policies, and and also looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 16%. He has the right policies, but does NOT look or sound like a possible prime minister: 59%. His policies are wrong, but he looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 5%. His policies are wrong, and he does NOT look or sound [like] a possible Prime Minister: 11%. Don't know: 9%. Alistair Darling is the second choice for Labour voters pushing Miliband into third place with just seven per cent saying he is the best person to lead the party. Shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has been touted as the favourite candidate for the job if Miliband is replaced by the time of the next election in spring 2015. Last week it was suggested by John Humphrys that Ed Miliband did not look right for the job of PM to which he replied 'I don't accept that'. However, only 10 per cent of people said they thought that Miliband was 'too ugly' for the job. The prospect of a leadership election has been ruled out at this stage, however, with some of his harshest critics saying it is too early, instead believing autumn 2013 to be the best time for change. Embattled Ed Miliband was told by Labour MPs on Saturday night to stop copying David Cameron and start showing some leadership of his own. The Labour leader sparked a furious backlash after the party abandoned opposition to the Coalition's public-sector pay freeze and refused to reverse cuts. The U-turn was unveiled by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who insisted the party had to set a 'credible' alternative to the Coalition and be 'honest with the British people'. But Labour MPs accused the two Eds of caving into the Tory agenda. Labour veteran Austin Mitchell attacked 'barmy' Mr Balls's cuts somersaults and also lambasted 'weak' Mr Miliband. He told The Mail on Sunday: 'This is a desperate attempt to get respectability but it's barmy. Miliband is acting out of weakness. We are not the Government and we will get nowhere by going around wearing a hair shirt like this.' The poll was carried out just days after Miliband underwent a relaunch to answer those who doubted his abilities as leader. In a scathing attack on the Labour party, Mr Bozier writes in his blog that Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls were 'out-of-touch', Brownite career politicians. He criticises the wider party saying it has been taken over by student politicians and is unable to 'put aside its tribal prejudice and ideology'. He writes: 'Ed Miliband is a leader that Labour MPs and Labour members didn't want. He was forced upon them by the Trade Unions and like most people, I wasn't happy with the result. 'I tried for as long as I could to give Ed the benefit of the doubt. But look what it's come to, with the party and the leader now a national laughing stock. 'Rarely in British history has a leader become so quickly defined by humiliating questions about his looks and personality. On his new allegiance to the Tory's, Mr Bozier said: 'David Cameron, sensing the intellectual and political paralysis throughout the Labour Party, has picked up New Labour's baton of reform and is running with it. 'Cameron's Conservatives have again become the party of the aspirational classes.' He concludes: 'But the Labour Party - which has comfortably turned back into Old Labour - no longer speaks for this country. 'And it no longer speaks for me and the sort of Britain I want for my children. And that is why, today, I am joining the Conservatives.' Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Movie title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump.

I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her.

Syntax: In terms of syntax, the sentence follows a logical structure: Subject: The knee replacement candidate Verb: groaned Modifier of the verb (adverbial phrase indicating direction): up the stairs The subject is a compound noun (\\"knee replacement candidate\\") that specifies the person who requires a knee replacement. The verb (\\"groaned\\") shows the action typically accompanying discomfort or pain, and the adverbial phrase (\\"up the stairs\\") describes the direction of this action. The sentence follows standard subject-verb-object/adverbial phrase order found in English sentences. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning: a person in need of a knee replacement is experiencing difficulty or discomfort while going up the stairs. This is a plausible and coherent situation because people with knee issues often struggle with movement and experience pain while climbing stairs. In conclusion, the sentence is both syntactically and semantically acceptable as it follows standard sentence structure in the English language and conveys a clear and plausible meaning.

Problem:Hello all, I am having an issue with one of my friends (Lets call him Dave) and thought I'd see if I am handling this properly. To start I am quite upset and have decided that I will not be attending an event this weekend that we have planned awhile ago. What happened: Two weeks ago Dave invited two of his friends to his house party. I have met the one a few times but not the other. Everything was going well and the party was a fun time until these two new people decided I wasnt drunk enough for them and started pressuring me to drink shots with them. By this time I was at a perfect drunk for myself and didn't want to push my limits so I declined. They became annoyingly insistent getting everyone in the party to call me a pussy and other names and make the whole focus of the party on me drinking this nasty ass rum. Eventually I caved and drank a shot but that wasnt good enough either and these two people kept harrassing me to drink. A few more shots deep and I was at the point of no return and blacked out. I threw up and passed out and felt that hangover for two days. I know my drinking limits and I am very good at finding the right buzz for the occasion. I dont need to be told to drink and I was very pissed off both at myself for letting them pressure me and these people for forcing me to. Cut to this weekend where I was invited to another predrink and bar night. I talked to Dave and discussed the plan and whatever. We had a two hour conversation catching up and I told him how I felt about his friends he invited and I asked who was all going this time and they werent mentioned. Cool. I show up and we are all having a good time but then Dave shows up with these two friends of his. Immediately they are on my case to drink. I flat out told them no and they wouldnt let it go. 5 minutes into them joining our party I am yelling at them to leave me alone. Dave knows how I felt about last time and he is just watching this go on and also at points is encouraging them. This goes on the whole night. I told myself I wouldn't let them persuade me this time and they didn't but because of that night the whole night I was harrassed because I wouldn't drink with them. They tried every berating insult they could muster to the point people came up to me including Dave's girlfriend apologizing for their behavior. I ignored it the best I could and focused on making it a good night for myself. Well the next morning they're in one of our fb group chats mocking me even more and I am just done with these guys. I talked to our other friends and they agreed they didnt enjoy these guys' company and I called Dave and told them I didnt ever want to be involved in plans with them again. If he wants to hangout with them power to him but they're assholes who can't take no for an answer and I asked him to stop bringing them around me. He agreed and I thought the issue was over. Cut to 10 minutes later he adds them to our call and asks me to explain why I dont want to hangout with them anymore. I couldn't believe it. I felt so betrayed in that moment that Dave would sell me out like that and force a confrontation with these guys I dont even know or want to further socialize with. I hung up on him and then called him back and tried to explain how mad he would be if I betrayed him like that. He didn't understand how I was mad and didnt think it was a big deal. I haven't talked to him since and we have an event planned this weekend that I have told everyone I wont be going to. Am I overreacting? Or am I justified in not wanting to see Dave for awhile. Solution:","completion":"Answerable In this situation, it seems that Dave is in the wrong for not being considerate of the user's feelings about his friends and their behavior. The user explicitly communicated their discomfort and dislike for these friends, which Dave not only ignored but also prioritized over the user's feelings. Additionally, by forcing a confrontation between the user and these friends, Dave further disrespected the user's wishes. Therefore, the user is justified in not wanting to see Dave for a while."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Context: David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY. Question: What did David Gauntlett write about?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door. The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it. Do I get the booby prize?\\" \\"That depends on whether you intended a double entendre or not.\\" \\"Of course I did.\\" \\"Then you lose. Get your mind out of the gutter.\\" He took a drag on his cigarette, then made himself sound insulted. \\"I'm not the one sitting around naked and calling strange men in the middle of the night.\\" Question: Whose office was right behind the secretary's desk? Options: - not enough information - Ray's - the secretary's - the receptionist's A:","completion":"The correct option is Ray's office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The West's belief in peaceful democracy endures, in part, because it celebrates us, because we think that the spread of democracy will usher in a period of peace that will allow us to concentrate on our own needs and ignore those of others. Does it follow that \\"The West's belief in peaceful democracy endures because of our fear of autocratic forms of government.\\"? (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","completion":"(C). no. The statement in the question does not mention or imply a fear of autocratic forms of government as a reason for the West's belief in peaceful democracy enduring. Instead, it suggests that this belief persists partly because it celebrates the West's ideals and makes them think that spreading democracy will lead to a more peaceful environment. This would then allow the West to focus on its own needs while disregarding the needs of others. Answer (A) is wrong because the passage does not mention or imply fear of autocracy. Answer (B) is wrong because the given statement does provide an alternative reasoning for the endurance of the West's belief in peaceful democracy, which does not involve fear of autocratic forms of government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
