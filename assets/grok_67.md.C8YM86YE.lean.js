Question: Who is Tadaklan's pet that is responsible for lightning? Answer: In Philippine mythology, Kimat who is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? --yes. --no.","completion":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but I can provide a more detailed and long answer for better understanding. In Philippine mythology, each region has a unique set of gods and goddesses, spirits, and other mystic creatures. The Tagalog ethnic group, which is one of the largest groups in the Philippines, has a wealth of myths and folktales featuring various deities and mythical beings. Tadaklan and his pet Kimat are some of the figures from this rich mythology. Tadaklan, also known as \\"Dadaklan\\" or \\"Darakla\\" in some Tagalog myths, is believed to be the god of thunder. He is often depicted as a powerful deity who rides the clouds and controls the forces of thunder and storms. The concept of a thunder deity in Philippine mythology is quite common, as in many other world mythologies. Tadaklan was widely revered and feared, as the natural phenomenon of thunderstorms was considered to be a manifestation of his power and might. Kimat, on the other hand, represents the key element associated with thunderstorms - lightning. Kimat is known to be Tadaklan's loyal pet, often described as a dog or a serpent, which unleashes lightning whenever a storm approaches. It is believed that when Tadaklan cracks his whip, it signals Kimat to create lightning, causing a powerful display of electric light in the sky. As a fierce pet and loyal companion, Kimat was seen as an extension of Tadaklan's authority and strength. At the behest of Tadaklan, Kimat terrifies people and creatures below with terrifying bolts of lightning during stormy weather. These myths and stories represent the ancient Tagalog people's way of explaining natural occurrences, such as thunderstorms and lightning, through the intervention of powerful beings. In this case, the god of thunder Tadaklan and his pet Kimat were responsible for the terrifying yet mesmerizing natural events that were witnessed during intense storms. This belief system greatly influenced the ancient Tagalog's worldview and their understanding of the forces of nature. In conclusion, Kimat is the pet of Tadaklan, the god of thunder in Philippine mythology, and is responsible for creating lightning during thunderstorms. The ancient Tagalog people attributed the phenomenon of lightning to the actions of these supernatural beings as a way of explaining and understanding the natural world around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories. Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school.

Answer the following question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does Paul Ryan feel about the petition? Possible answers: (1). not enough information (2). He is sure that Trump will sign it (3).

Write a title for this article: One of Marvel Comics' brightest stars takes on the original Marvel Universe book when Fraction becomes the writer on the relaunched Fantastic Four in the fall, as well as the spinoff sister series FF, as part of the company's Marvel NOW! initiative. \\"This is the family car. Don't scratch it,\\" says Fraction, who takes on the two books while moving on from The Mighty Thor and Invincible Iron Man. He's doing some detailing on the old classic, though. His Fantastic Four, which teams Fraction with artist Mark Bagley (Ultimate Spider-Man, Thunderbolts), will take the whole family of superheroes —Reed Richards and wife Sue (aka Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman), their two kids Franklin and Valeria, plus teammates Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) and Ben Grimm, the ever-lovin' Thing — on a journey through time and space. Illustrated by Mike Allred (Madman) in his trademark pop-art style, FF will get a new look and a new replacement Fantastic Four squad, with Ant-Man heading up Reed's Future Foundation and teaming with She-Hulk, the Inhumans' Medusa and Miss Thing, an all-new female character clad in a Thing suit of armor. For the main Fantastic Four book, Fraction says, \\"it's the first family, and we're putting family first.\\" The story line to kick off both of his new books, which share a definite road map, is actually inspired by, of all people, Gov. Angus King of Maine. When he left office in 2003, he, his wife and his two kids hopped in a 40-foot RV and for six months, saw America by driving 15,000 miles over 34 states. \\"It was this intensive road-trip home-school experience,\\" Fraction says. \\"I don't really know any parent who wouldn't want to do that with the time and money available.\\" The story stuck with Fraction, and it became the root of his idea for the Richards clan: Reed builds a ship that will take his team and his children across time and space for an epic historical lesson, the writer says. \\"If they're studying ancient Rome, then by God let's go have lunch with Caesar on the Ides of March. If they're looking at the Big Bang, they're going to watch it from the front row.\\" They'll be gone for a year — which will only be four minutes in regular Earth time — and while there will be continuing plot threads, each issue will be a new adventure and new situation. \\"It's very easy to say, 'I want to stay true to what Stan and Jack did.' Well, what Stan and Jack did was invent the entirety of the Marvel Universe in 104 issues,\\" Fraction says of the original Fantastic Four comic that launched in 1961. \\"This is the place to be wildly inventive, and I would like to put as many things down on the page as humanly possible and offer up another dose next issue.\\" The Big Bang happened in less than a second, though, so four minutes is an eternity for the big brain of Reed Richards. He makes it a point for them to choose the people they want to carry on their legacy just in case something goes awry since the Earth will still need protection. Ant-Man and his group stand guard for the four minutes, but nothing happens. Three weeks later, a one-eyed, one-legged, long-haired, half-insane, bearded Johnny Storm walks through the time gateway, shuts it behind him and says, \\"We can never open this door again.\\" The new crew of FF were carefully chosen by the old team as well as Fraction. Reed Richards reaches out to Scott Lang because as Ant-Man, he's scientific, he has things to prove, he's a family man and, because he recently lost his daughter Cassie, Reed feels putting this brokenhearted hero in charge of the kids in the Future Foundation will help him. Sue wants a woman like Medusa who has a link to the Fantastic Four through the Inhumans but could also be a mother, a hero, a friend, a wife and \\"seemingly have eight arms to handle all these jobs at once,\\" Fraction says. She-Hulk has a pedigree with the team since she has been a member of the Fantastic Four, plus she'd be Ben's pick because she's \\"the one person he knew he could never lick,\\" says Fraction, who writes Red She-Hulk in Defenders, which ends its run at issue 12 in November. \\"Strong guys are easy but you need more than just a strong guy.\\" Miss Thing is the most interesting choice because, as Fraction puts it, \\"Johnny spaces it because he's Johnny.\\" She just happens to be a \\"Lohan-esque celebutante blonde\\" he's with the night before he leaves and she's thrown into the middle of this situation. \\"She's the regular person, she's the human, she's the overwhelmed 'Whaaa?' of it all,\\" Fraction says. For Fantastic Four, Bagley takes his first crack at the group and brings both warmth as well as big-time action sequences to the book, according to Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort. And with Allred, he says, FF will have a tone and a flavor that will make it different from anything else on comic shelves. \\"My hope is that it will be quirky in the same way that the Fantastic Four were quirky when they first appeared in the early '60s,\\" Brevoort explains. \\"We know who they are, we know what they're about, but when they first showed up, it was like a bomb going off in comics. \\"These were remarkable characters who were doing unexpected things and had a real element of danger to it and excitement and unpredictability. The hope is we'll be able to tap into something akin to that.\\" Ant-Man has been one of Allred's all-time favorite characters since he was a kid, and when Marvel editor in chief Axel Alonso told him he'd be doing the superhero with Fraction, \\"I did a back flip,\\" the artist says. \\"He's always in touch with the deepest part of my brain.\\" Allred \\"melted\\" when he learned Medusa was on the new team — \\"She was my first and favorite costumed comic-book crush,\\" he says — and is falling for the other two women, too. He almost pushed to replace She-Hulk, \\"but then my brain cracked open, and like many 'arranged marriages,' I saw her soul and opened my heart to her,\\" says Allred, adding that Miss Thing \\"is so weird and wild.\\" He digs the chemistry between the four and is giving them all matching uniforms — \\"except the 'new kid' who has the most 'traditional' look for obvious reasons,\\" Allred says. Brevoort reports that the new FF artist is \\"the happiest man on the face of the Earth. His enthusiasm is electrifying. He enjoys getting to play with all this stuff. It has such a nice bounce and spark to it because of that.\\" At meetings discussing the changes of Marvel NOW!, Fantastic Four received a good amount of interest from different writers because it's one of \\"the mini-crown jewels of Marvel,\\" according to Brevoort. Fraction, though, was perfect for it and FF in a couple of ways, the editor says, starting with the cutting-edge, technological aspect of Fantastic Four. \\"Matt's obviously got something of a crazy science brain.\\" Plus, like Reed Richards, he's a big family man — Fraction has two young children with wife (and Captain Marvel writer) Kelly Sue DeConnick, and part of the Fantastic Four appeal for him, he says, was \\"a chance for me to tell stories about my family through the lens of the cornerstone of the Marvel Universe.\\" In doing so, Fraction aims for the title to be entertaining for all ages, from his kids to the older comic fan. \\"I feel that one of the best Fantastic Four stories was The Incredibles, and I want to take that back. It's so arrogant to say but it should have been us. We should have done that,\\" Fraction says, laughing. \\"If this could be the Pixar version of the Fantastic Four, something that everyone can enjoy, not just our medium 30-year-old white-dude reader, I'd be happy.\\" Whereas the Fantastic Four is about the Richards family having all-new adventures, FF is about an all-new Fantastic Four getting to meet the team's greatest hits, Fraction teases. \\"Suddenly, there are imposters to the throne and they come out of the woodwork for these guys.\\" Ant-Man has an agenda of his own, too, in addition to protecting the world. He blames Doctor Doom for the death of his daughter and, with the power of the Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation, wonders what would happen if they declared war on Latveria and devoted all their time and resources to eliminating Doom once and for all. \\"It's a dark twist on what the Fantastic Four is about — it's the other side of the coin,\\" Fraction says. \\"We have this Fantastic Four with a specific mission in FF and how can he direct and bring these people along with him?\\" His favorite Fantastic Four run of all time is still Lee and Kirby's first issues in the '60s, and Fraction feels the pure raw inventive power of them is unmatched. Reading those, \\"you watch an idiom get invented, and when they really hit their stride, just page after page after page is remarkable,\\" Fraction says. \\"I can't actually read Kirby for too long. I can only go a handful of pages and I have to take a break and chew things over. \\"It's so imaginative, it just sends me spinning. I have to put it down and daydream for a little while and go back to it.\\" Fraction admits he's \\"terrified\\" he's going to screw up Fantastic Four, but he feeds off that fear and to be true to the spirit of the book, he says, \\"you've got to invent, invent, invent. \\"That's an all-too-rare occurrence in comics these days but I'm excited to get started.\\"","completion":"A Fantastic Adventure: Marvel's Superhero Family Explores Time and Space"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fatima stood still, taking in the sights and sounds of the marketplace as it transformed from a hub of activity to a quiet, flickering canvas of shadows and dancing flames. Eventually, Rashid returned to his beloved camel, his face flushed from the heat and excitement of the day. Feeling the satisfying weight of a job well done and a successful day's investment, Rashid patted Fatima affectionately on the side, and they began to make their way back through the now-quietened streets. The warm air carried a gentle breeze, which offered a faint whisper of relief from the day's earlier heat.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 5 Things Never Heard at the Most Innovative Companies My colleague Kathy Gersch explains that while it may be difficult for your company to generate innovative ideas, high-tech start-ups and other companies we consider to have innovation built into their DNA have just as much difficulty maintaining their innovative edge. The most interesting thing about the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies 2013 list isn’t who is on it. It’s who isn’t. Writing about the companies that had fallen off the list (and were obviously upset about it), Robert Safian, Editor of Fast Company magazine said, “It’s not that these businesses suddenly lost their mojo. But in a climate where the velocity of change is accelerating, these companies didn’t have a compelling-enough breakthrough for us to highlight.” Safian’s remark perfectly illustrates the essential element required for survival in today’s economic environment. If you aren’t constantly innovating, your organization is most likely losing its edge. If your innovations are incremental – not big enough to move the needle – you’re still losing. What do the companies on Fast Company’s list like Nike, Uber, and Pinterest have that others like Facebook and Twitter don’t? Better new products – which came from innovative ideas, that’s obvious. The mystery is where these ideas come from, how they rise to get noticed, and then how they are brought to market faster than anyone else. This list is a reminder that some of the companies we’ve historically associated with innovation because of their brand name (3M, Facebook, and Twitter) aren’t immune to losing their edge. While people have spilled much ink on how to create innovation, I’d like to offer an easier way to get there – by process of elimination. Let’s start with five things you will NOT hear at the most innovative organizations. Be on alert for them; These are clear indicators that your company is losing its innovation “mojo.” 1. “Can we do that?” Permission seekers are the mark of unclear company vision. If your company’s vision is clear enough, and has been communicated constantly and consistently, people do not come to you for permission, they come to show you what they’ve already done. 2. “We can’t do that.” On the flip side of the previous comment, you find the limitations or barriers people have set up in reaction to the punishment they’ve experienced for prior failures. If your people see others try, fail, then get punished, you can guarantee that people will remain in the safe spot. No one is going to try to innovate, much less try anything remotely outside the box ever again. 3. “We have to go through proper channels.” A mark of truly innovative companies is that the employees are well-networked, and they are constantly crossing silo walls to engage other departments, gather knowledge, or just get an outside opinion. Though one person may come up with the idea, nobody creates a great innovation solely on their own. 4. “That’s good enough.” In many companies, once significant progress is made, momentum slows and eventually the project fails. This is one of the key reasons 70% of change efforts fail. Yes, it’s important to celebrate incremental wins, but in innovative companies, people don’t let up – they continue to focus on the final prize. This only comes from a relentless focus on winning. 5. “That’s not my job.” This final phrase is the clearest indicator that people aren’t focused on the future of the company. If employees have a clear understanding of the vision set by leadership, no one will be talking in terms of their box on the org-chart. If you hear “us” and “them” language referring to internal teams, beware. Employees at innovative companies know it is always “our” job – we win together. Stay on the alert to these dangerous phrases that might sneak into conversations in your organization. A great brand name no longer protects you from losing your edge. Remember Kodak? Kathy Gersch is an Executive Vice President at Kotter International, a firm that helps leaders accelerate strategy implementation in their organizations. John Kotter is the chief innovation officer at Kotter International, and is the Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Leadership, Emeritus, at Harvard Business School. Read Dr. Kotter’s new article, “Accelerate!,” featured in the Harvard Business Review, in which he explains how organizations can develop the agility required to succeed in today’s rapidly changing world.

The Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list highlights this issue, with some familiar names, such as Facebook and Twitter, falling off the list. Companies like Nike, Uber, and Pinterest managed to remain on the list by constantly developing better products and staying ahead in the market. To maintain innovation, companies must eliminate certain barriers that impede progress, such as unclear company vision, fear of punishment for failure, strict adherence to proper channels, settling for \\"good enough,\\" and a lack of unity or teamwork.

Choices: - weight - resistance - energy - pressure A:","completion":"Aside from temperature, pressure also has a significant effect on the phase of a substance. Let's explore it in more detail, as well as briefly discuss the other options. A. Pressure: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the phase of a substance, affecting the balance of the intermolecular forces between particles. For example, an increase in pressure can cause a gas to condense into a liquid and a liquid to solidify. Vice versa, a decrease in pressure can cause a solid to become a liquid, or a liquid to turn into a gas. The equilibrium between phases can be described by phase diagrams, which are graphical representations of the pressure and temperature conditions under which various phases of a substance coexist. An excellent example of pressure's influence on a substance's phase is carbon dioxide, which is a solid (dry ice) at low temperatures and pressures but becomes a liquid or gas at higher pressures and temperatures. B. Weight: Weight, defined as the force exerted on an object due to gravity, does not directly impact a substance's phase. However, weight can influence processes such as sedimentation, where the particles in a substance settle due to gravity, resulting in phase separation. In such cases, weight can contribute indirectly to phase behavior, but it does not inherently affect the phase of a substance. C. Resistance: Resistance refers to the opposition a material offers to the flow of electric current. While resistance can be related to the material's properties, it does not directly affect a substance's phase. A higher or lower resistance value would not impact the state of matter of a substance, as it is not associated with the fundamental physical and chemical properties responsible for phase transitions. D. Energy: Energy plays an indirect role in determining the phase of a substance. A change in a substance's phase, such as the transition from solid to liquid, typically occurs when it absorbs or releases energy, either in the form of heat or work. This process is driven by the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transferred from one form to another. For example, when a solid melts, it absorbs energy as heat, overcoming the intermolecular forces that keep its particles in place, and allowing the particles to move more freely, thus becoming a liquid. Similarly, during freezing, a liquid releases energy as heat, and its particles slow and their intermolecular forces strengthen, forming a solid. In summary, while weight, resistance, and energy can have some indirect influences on the behavior of substances, pressure has the most direct impact on their phase. Changes in pressure can shift the equilibrium between phases, leading to phase transitions that fulfill the conditions set by phase diagrams and the thermodynamics of the substance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: A Shine of Rainbows Movie plot: Young orphan TomÃ¡s (John Bell) is harassed and ridiculed for his small size, timidity and stuttering by the other children in his orphanage. Just after freeing a pigeon from his classroom, he is called to the headmasters' office to be greeted by Maire (Connie Nielsen), who has adopted him, and takes him back to her island home, where TomÃ¡s is greeted somewhat coldly by her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), a fisherman, who had expected someone older and perhaps more confident, and TomÃ¡s is intimidated by Alec. TomÃ¡s makes friends with Nancy (Tara Alice Scully) and is greeted tepidly by Seamus (Jack Gleeson). They take him to their 'secret' cave, inhabited by bats. There, TomÃ¡s runs away, scared, after which his two friends chase after him and console him. TomÃ¡s is introduced to his new school and, unlike at his previous school, here he is generally accepted by the pupils. As Maire's influence on him begins to shine through, he starts to gain in confidence and become drawn to wildlife. Soon thereafter, Alec and TomÃ¡s get a little closer, and when Maire has to go to the mainland for some shopping, Alec and TomÃ¡s go fishing. Together they find a young seal, apparently abandoned, on the beach. Christened 'Smudge' by TomÃ¡s, he wants to care for it and feeds it regularly for the next many days. For TomÃ¡s' birthday, the couple give him a new fishing rod &amp; reel. Maire suggests that the two guys go fishing, Alec to teach TomÃ¡s how to use the tackle, and the plan is set. The next morning, they head out, but Alec, distracted with helping some friends move a stuck boat, tells TomÃ¡s, \\"I won't be long, wait down there.\\" TomÃ¡s waits around nearly all day for him to show up, but Alec, after helping, then instead goes to the pub with the friends. Maire finds TomÃ¡s and takes him out in the boat herself.

Leave home unnecessary gadgets.","completion":"Title: How to Travel Light: Tips for Leaving Unnecessary Items at Home Introduction: Traveling is an exciting and enriching experience, but packing can be a challenging task. One of the keys to a successful trip is traveling light, which means leaving unnecessary items at home. Not only does this make your journey more enjoyable, but it can also save you money on baggage fees and reduce the risk of losing valuable items. In this article, we will discuss the importance of leaving valuables, toiletries, bulky books, and gadgets at home, ensuring a stress-free and organized travel experience. 1. Leave Your Valuables at Home: The first step to traveling light is leaving your valuable items at home. Bringing expensive items such as jewelry, high-end electronics, and designer bags can make you a target for theft. In addition, losing or damaging these items during transit would be a terrible disappointment. Instead, select travel-friendly, less expensive alternatives for your journey. Tip: Use a digital wallet or prepaid debit card instead of carrying large amounts of cash or credit cards. 2. Ditch the Toiletries: Packing full-sized toiletries is a common mistake that adds unnecessary weight and takes up space in your luggage. Instead, transfer your favorite shampoo, conditioner, and body wash into small, travel-sized bottles that meet airline regulations. Better yet, consider purchasing travel-sized toiletries upon arrival at your destination. This will save space in your luggage and ensure that you only have the essentials. Tip: Opt for solid toiletries like bar soap and shampoo bars, which take up less space and eliminate the risk of spills. 3. Leave Bulky Books Behind: While books can be great travel companions, they can also weigh down your luggage. Instead of bringing heavy paperbacks or hardcover books, utilize e-books and audiobooks on your smartphone or e-reader. This will not only lighten your load but also provide you with a wide variety of reading material for your journey. Tip: Public libraries often offer free access to e-books and audiobooks through their digital lending programs. 4. Travel Without Unnecessary Gadgets: In today's technological age, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the number of gadgets available for daily use. While you may be tempted to bring along multiple devices, consider which gadgets are essential to your trip and leave the rest at home. For instance, most smartphones now have impressive built-in cameras, making it unnecessary to carry a separate digital camera. Additionally, portable chargers and multi-purpose adapters can replace multiple cables and charging devices. Tip: Invest in a dedicated travel tech organizer to keep your essential gadgets organized and easily accessible. Conclusion: Traveling light can make your journey more enjoyable, organized, and stress-free. By leaving valuables at home, ditching the toiletries, opting for digital reading material, and carefully selecting necessary gadgets, you can ensure a smooth and hassle-free travel experience. Embrace the freedom that comes with packing light, and discover the joy of exploring new places unburdened by the weight of unnecessary possessions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Knowing this information will help you tailor your efforts more effectively. Step 2: Develop strong basketball skills It is crucial to practice regularly and improve your basketball skills to showcase your talent to college coaches. Consider joining a local team or attending basketball camps to enhance your playing abilities and gain experience. Step 3: Excel academically Maintaining good grades and a high GPA is essential, as colleges and scholarship programs often consider both your athletic and academic achievements. Academic success can also lead to additional scholarship opportunities. Step 4: Create an athletic resume or portfolio Prepare a resume or portfolio that highlights your basketball achievements, statistics, awards, and any relevant experience such as team captainship. This document will be helpful when contacting coaches and applying for scholarships. Step 5: Record and compile game footage Coaches and recruiters often want to see you in action, so make sure to have game footage readily available, either through a personal website, social media, or video-sharing platform like YouTube. This will help showcase your skills and provide evidence of your talent on the court. Step 6: Attend college exposure camps and showcases Participate in exposure camps or showcases to gain visibility and network with college coaches. These events are designed to provide an opportunity for high school athletes to demonstrate their skills and receive recruiting attention. Step 7: Network and communicate with college coaches Initiate contact with college coaches by sending them your athletic resume, portfolio, and game footage. Be proactive in expressing your interest in their program and ask for feedback on how you can improve your chances of receiving a scholarship.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.

What is the best way to: Dry school notebook.","completion":"Drying a wet school notebook may require some time, patience, and specific techniques to minimize damage to the pages and ensure that the contents remain legible. Here is a step-by-step approach to dry your school notebook effectively: 1. Remove Excess Water: The first step is to remove as much water as possible from the notebook. Hold the notebook by its edge or spine, allowing gravity to drain the excess water. You can also gently shake the notebook to remove any remaining droplets. Be cautious not to tear or further damage the pages. 2. Blot and Absorb: Place the notebook on a clean, flat surface with the pages spread open. Lay some absorbent material, such as paper towels or tissue papers, between the wet pages to help absorb the moisture. Start by placing a paper towel every 10 to 20 pages. Press down gently on the pages to help the absorbent material soak up the moisture. Replace the wet towels with dry ones, repeating the process until they no longer absorb any water. Be mindful not to rub the pages as it may cause ink smudging or tearing. 3. Use a Fan or Air-dry: Set up a fan near the open notebook on a medium setting to encourage quicker evaporation of moisture. Ensure the fan is not blowing directly on the pages to avoid scattering them or further damaging the notebook. Alternatively, if you don't have access to a fan, leave the notebook in a well-ventilated area to air-dry. This process may take several hours or even days, depending on the amount of moisture and the type of paper. 4. Make Use of Heavy Books or Weights: As the pages of the notebook start drying, you may notice some warping or wrinkling. To minimize this issue, place a heavy book or a flat weight on top of the notebook. Be sure that the notebook is not completely dry before applying any weight; otherwise, it may damage the pages or cause them to stick together. 5. Use a Hairdryer or Iron (Optional): If you're in a hurry or need your notebook dried faster, you can cautiously use a hairdryer or an iron. Keep the hairdryer on a low heat or cool setting and maintain a safe distance from the pages to avoid burning or damaging them. Keep the dryer moving back and forth to evenly distribute the warm air. For the iron method, first, ensure the iron is on the lowest heat setting, and the steam function is turned off. Place a paper towel or thin cloth between the notebook page and the iron to avoid direct contact. Gently iron over the pages in a consistent motion to dry them out while avoiding any creases or burns. This method can be time-consuming as you will need to do this for each page, making it unsuitable for thick notebooks. 6. Monitor the Drying Process: Check the notebook periodically to assess the moisture level and to replace the paper towels or tissues if necessary. If using a fan, hairdryer, or iron, keep an eye on the notebook to ensure it is not over-dried or damaged. 7. Final Pressing: Once the notebook is entirely dry, close it, and place heavy books or weights on top. Leave it for at least a few hours or overnight to help flatten the pages further and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Remember, patience is key when it comes to drying a school notebook. The most effective method is allowing it to air-dry naturally, although it may take longer. Avoid microwaves or other high-heat methods, as they may cause irreversible damage to your notebook."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The story of Lady Godiva’s naked ride through the streets of Coventry has been a cornerstone of British folklore for 1,000 years. But now a Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse. The situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called The Lady Godiva last week, warning that it was infringing on its ‘intellectual property’. Owner Glen Simons was given a 90-day ultimatum to change his bar’s name and remove all references to the 11th Century noblewoman, whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend.

We understand that the inclusion of Lady Godiva's name and image in our branding and marketing efforts not only builds a strong connection to the British cultural heritage and a rich historical legacy, but also allows us to offer a unique and engaging proposition to consumers, both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. While we acknowledge that the story of Lady Godiva is a beloved part of British folklore, it is important to protect our brand identity and the significant investments we have made in developing our range of Lady Godiva-themed offerings. It is our mission to create value through our Lady Godiva brand and to continue innovating our offerings to meet the evolving taste preferences and demands of our global customer base. Legally, our company has taken significant steps to secure the rights to both the name \\"Lady Godiva\\" and the famous image of her on top of a horse. We have filed various trademark and copyright applications to protect our intellectual property and to ensure that no other business can profit from our efforts in building and promoting the Lady Godiva brand. That being said, we recognize the importance of coexistence and collaboration within the communities where our products are sold and enjoyed. We have approached the matter of The Lady Godiva pub with a great deal of sensitivity and respect, understanding that the pub owner and the local community might have a strong attachment to the historical figure and her actions against oppressive taxes. Rather than resorting to legal battles, we believe the most logical solution to this situation would be to initiate a dialogue with The Lady Godiva pub and to explore possible options that could benefit both parties without infringing on our intellectual property rights. These options could include: 1. Exploring a co-branding or licensing opportunity, where the pub could retain the use of the Lady Godiva name and image in exchange for certain brand-related commitments, potentially even incorporating our Lady Godiva-themed products and services within their establishment. 2. Offering financial or marketing assistance to the pub, helping them with the rebranding process to create a new identity that respects the historical significance of Lady Godiva but does not infringe on our intellectual property rights. 3. Encouraging the pub owner to come up with an alternative connection to British folklore or historical figures that are not under the protection of trademark or copyright law, and agreeing to collaborate on the creation of a new, shared identity that highlights the unique qualities of both The Lady Godiva pub and our Lady Godiva brand. In conclusion, while we must protect our legal rights to the Lady Godiva name and image, we believe that the most logical approach to completing this passage is to seek a resolution that embraces the shared values and interests of both our company and The Lady Godiva pub. By engaging in a respectful dialogue and exploring creative solutions, we can both maintain our commitment to promoting the rich cultural heritage of Britain, while respecting the need to protect our respective investments and brand equity."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Arenaviruses cause severe diseases in humans but establish asymptomatic, lifelong infections in rodent reservoirs. Persistently-infected rodents harbor high levels of defective interfering (DI) particles, which are thought to be important for establishing persistence and mitigating virus-induced cytopathic effect. Little is known about what drives the production of DI particles. We show that neither the PPXY late domain encoded within the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein nor a functional endosomal sorting complex transport (ESCRT) pathway is absolutely required for the generation of standard infectious virus particles. In contrast, DI particle release critically requires the PPXY late domain and is ESCRT-dependent. Additionally, the terminal tyrosine in the PPXY motif is reversibly phosphorylated and our findings indicate that this posttranslational modification may regulate DI particle formation. Thus we have uncovered a new role for the PPXY late domain and a possible mechanism for its regulation. Arenaviruses cause severe and often fatal diseases in humans yet typically establish lifelong, asymptomatic infections in their rodent reservoirs. Several families of enveloped RNA viruses, including the arenaviruses, encode short amino acid motifs, called late domains, to hijack host proteins in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to drive the release of virus particles from the host cell's outer membrane. Many late domain-containing viruses produce defective interfering (DI) particles in addition to standard, infectious virus. DI particles cannot self-replicate but interfere with the production of infectious virus and mitigate virus-induced cytopathic effect. Arenaviruses such as PLOS Pathogens | lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) generate high levels of DI particles, yet, the mechanism that drives their formation is not known. We show that LCMV's only encoded late domain, PPXY, and a functional ESCRT pathway are critical for DI particle production, but in contrast, are not absolutely required for infectious virus production. We also demonstrate that the LCMV PPXY late domain is phosphorylated and that this modification may regulate DI particle production. In summary, we have discovered a new and unexpected role for a viral late domain in selectively driving the production of DI particles independently of standard infectious virus particles. Arenaviruses are a family of rodent-borne viruses with a worldwide distribution. These viruses typically establish persistent, asymptomatic infections in rodent reservoir species [1]. In contrast, arenaviruses cause severe and often fatal diseases in humans. Several arenaviruses, including Lassa virus and Junín virus, cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes whereas infection with the prototypic arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), can lead to aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals, high lethality in immunocompromised individuals, or severe birth defects in the developing fetus [2,3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines do not exist for the prevention of arenavirus infection and effective antiviral therapies have been limited to the use of ribavirin for Lassa virus [4] or immune plasma for Junín virus [5] . Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, bi-segmented RNA genome that encodes four proteins in an ambisense manner. The small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP) while the large (L) segment encodes the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein (Z) [6] . Arenaviruses enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis [7], undergo genomic replication and transcription in the cytoplasm [6], and assemble and bud new particles at the plasma membrane [8] . The Z protein, which lines the luminal side of the viral membrane, is responsible for a number of critical functions in the virus life cycle, including driving the process of viral particle assembly and budding [9] . Accordingly, Z can form virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of other viral proteins and is thought to be both necessary and sufficient for driving the budding process [10, 11] . Several VLP-based studies indicate that Z drives viral particle release by virtue of one or more encoded viral late domain(s) (P(S/T)AP, YXXL, and/or PPXY), which can recruit proteins from the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway [10] [11] [12] . ESCRT machinery is required for most cellular membrane scission events that result in separation away from the cytosol including multivesicular body formation and cellular abscission [13] [14] [15] . Many enveloped viruses are known to hijack cellular ESCRT machinery via their late domains to complete the final membrane scission step required for virions to bud from host membranes (for review see [16] ). Viruses from diverse families, including arenaviruses, produce defective interfering (DI) particles in addition to standard, infectious virus during the normal course of infection [17] . DI particles are largely similar to standard virus particles in their appearance and viral protein content but cannot self-replicate, and interfere with the production of homologous standard virus [17] . In many cases, the primary difference between DI particles and standard virus is thought to be the presence of deletions in the viral genome [18] . With regard to LCMV, small deletions in the terminal untranslated regions of genomic and antigenomic RNAs have been PPXY Late Domain Drives the Release of LCMV DI Particles PLOS Pathogens | Title: The Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Matrix Protein PPXY Late Domain Drives the Production of Defective Interfering Particles A:","completion":"True I used the definition given in the task to determine if the title is suitable for the research paper based on the given paragraph.

Plains Indians, Interior Plains Indians or Indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have traditionally lived on the greater Interior Plains (i.e. the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies) in North America. Their historic nomadic culture and development of equestrian culture and resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for American Indians everywhere. Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the vast herds of buffalo, although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture. The earliest Spanish explorers in the 16th century did not find the Plains Indians especially warlike. The Wichita in Kansas and Oklahoma lived in dispersed settlements with no defensive works. The Spanish initially had friendly contacts with the Apache (Querechos) in the Texas Panhandle. Three factors led to a growing importance of warfare in Plains Indian culture. First, was the Spanish colonization of New Mexico which stimulated raids and counter-raids by Spaniards and Indians for goods and slaves. Second, was the contact of the Indians with French fur traders which increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. Third, was the acquisition of the horse and the greater mobility it afforded the Plains Indians. What evolved among the Plains Indians from the 17th to the late 19th century was warfare as both a means of livelihood and a sport. The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the encroaching frontier of the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were buffalo hides and beaver pelts. Although they could be tenacious in defense, Plains Indians warriors took the offensive mostly for material gain and individual prestige. The highest military honors were for \\"counting coup\\"--touching a live enemy. Battles between Indians often consisted of opposing warriors demonstrating their bravery rather than attempting to achieve concrete military objectives. The emphasis was on ambush and hit and run actions rather than closing with an enemy. Success was often counted by the number of horses or property obtained in the raid. Casualties were usually light. \\"Indians consider it foolhardiness to make an attack where it is certain some of them will be killed.\\" Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890. However, although Indians won many battles, they could not undertake lengthy campaigns. Indian armies could only be assembled for brief periods of time as warriors also had to hunt for food for their families. The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements. The basic weapon of the Indian warrior was the short, stout bow, designed for use on horseback and deadly, but only at short range. Guns were usually in short supply and ammunition scarce for Native warriors. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did the plains indians have battles with","completion":"The Plains Indians had battles with several groups. They fought with each other, as well as with the Spanish colonies, and later, with the people moving into their lands from the United States, this group of people are often referred to as the \\"Anglos\\" in history. They fought for many reasons, like getting more horses or other things they wanted, and also to show how brave and strong they were. This is a little bit like when you and your friends might race to see who is the fastest, or play a game to see who can score the most points. But it's important to remember that these were serious battles and could be very dangerous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is widely considered one of the most notable representatives of Early Netherlandish painting school. His work is known for its fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes, and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell. - Sir Peter Paul Rubens (28 June 1577 30 May 1640) was a Flemish/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter. He is widely considered as the most notable artist of Flemish Baroque art school. A proponent of an extravagant Baroque style that emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, Rubens is well known for his Counter-Reformation altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects. - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection. - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth. - Doménikos Theotokópoulos (; 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco, was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" (\\"The Greek\\") was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, (\\"Doménikos Theotokópoulos\\"), often adding the word (\\"Krs\\", \\"Cretan\\"). - The Dog is the name usually given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya , now in the Museo del Prado , Madrid . It shows the head of a small black dog gazing upwards . The dog itself is almost lost in the vastness of the rest of the image , which is empty except for a dark sloping area near the bottom of the picture : an unidentifiable mass which conceals the animal 's body . The Dog is one of the Black Paintings Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823 . He did not intend the paintings for public exhibition ( they were not removed from the house until 50 years after Goya had left ) , so it is unlikely that he gave them titles .

Q:Information: - Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFWA (or ) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers in the United States. It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was inaugurated in 1975 when Robert Heinlein was made the first SFWA Grand Master and it was renamed in 2002 after the Association's founder, Damon Knight, who had died that year.

The Commission's response to the crisis could not, therefore, be formulated globally but has taken into account the situation of each country. Translate to Romanian Romanian:","completion":"Răspunsul Comisiei la criză nu a putut, prin urmare, să fie formulat la nivel global, ci a luat în considerare situația fiecărei țări. În contextul crizei, Comisia Europeană a fost nevoită să adapteze și să formuleze măsuri specifice pentru fiecare țară în parte, în loc să adopte o abordare globală. Acest lucru a fost necesar, deoarece nivelul de impact și nevoile diferitelor țări variază în mod semnificativ, astfel încât o strategie globală ar fi fost insuficientă în abordarea problemelor cu care se confruntă fiecare națiune. Mai întâi, Comisia a trebuit să identifice zonele-cheie în care erau necesare intervenții, precum sănătatea publică, sistemul economic și piața muncii. De asemenea, a fost important să se analizeze severitatea crizei și vulnerabilitățile specifice ale fiecărei țări. Acest lucru a permis Comisiei să adopte o perspectivă multilaterală și să coordoneze eforturile la nivel național și european în contextul politicii de coeziune și al politicii economice și sociale. Un exemplu al abordării diferențiate a fost crearea de instrumente financiare la nivel european, cum ar fi: Mecanismul European de Stabilitate (MES), Fondul European pentru Investiții Strategice (FEIS) și programul SURE (Suport temporar pentru atenuarea riscului de șomaj în situația de urgență). Aceste instrumente au fost concepute pentru a ajuta statele membre să facă față impactului economic negativ cauzat de criza pandemică și pentru a facilita redresarea lor. De asemenea, pentru a aborda problemele de sănătate publică, Comisia a inclus în Planul European de Redresare și Reziliență (PERR) inițiative specifice în domeniul sănătății, cum ar fi EU4Health și fonduri dedicate reșelelor de sănătate și infrastructurii medicale. În plus, Comisia a coordonat eforturile în ceea ce privește procurarea și distribuirea vaccinurilor, precum și gestionarea frontierelor în interiorul spațiului Schengen. Pe lângă aceste măsuri, Comisia a adoptat, de asemenea, o serie de inițiative pentru a sprijini IMM-urile și pentru a proteja ocuparea forței de muncă în cadrul Programului de lucru al Comisiei Europene pentru 2021. Printre aceste inițiative se numără planurile naționale de investiții și reforme, precum și mecanisme pentru a facilita accesul la finanțare și partajarea riscului. În concluzie, Comisia Europeană a răspuns la criza generată de pandemie printr-o abordare diferențiată și adaptată situației fiecărei țări, luând în considerare circumstanțele și provocările specifice. Acest lucru a permis instituțiilor și guvernelor naționale să lucreze în tandem pentru a combate efectele crizei și a crea premisele unei redresări durabile și incluzive pe termen lung."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - become adults - wonder about - open door - became healthy - distracting Explain why a human would choose \\"distracting\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"\\"Distracting\\" would be the most feasible answer for the aforementioned question about the effects of the TV on kids, from the given options. This option directly relates to the substantial influence that television can play in children's daily lives, and has several underlying reasons pertaining to a child's mental, physical, and social development. First and foremost, when children spend substantial amounts of time in front of the television, it can detract from other important activities such as homework, reading, family conversation, or physical activity, leading to the interpretation of TV as a distraction. It absorbs time that they could use to develop necessary life skills, discover personal interests, or engage in creative play. In terms of mental development, TV can compete with quiet contemplation or reading that can foster creativity and critical thinking skills in children. This potential loss of cognitive development is a form of distraction. From a physical perspective, excess TV can promote a sedentary lifestyle and can lead to childhood obesity. This can create a mode of life that pushes physical activity into the periphery, distracting kids from the importance of maintaining their health. Moreover, social development could be hampered due to spending more time with technology than with people. Children risk losing out on essential interpersonal and communication skills. These issues frame the television as a device that distracts children from exploring and learning about the world around them in a beneficial, hands-on manner. The other options – \\"become adults,\\" \\"wonder about,\\" \\"open door,\\" and \\"became healthy\\" – don't suitably capture the broad impact television can have on children. None of these speak to common concerns about TV's effect on a child's growth and development. \\"Become adults\\" may not be accurate as watching TV doesn't necessarily precipitate maturity or take on adult responsibilities. \\"Wonder about\\" might hint at a stimulating effect, but it's less specific than \\"distracting\\" about the type of impact. \\"Open door\\" is too ambiguous - it could mean an intellectual 'opening of doors' or otherwise, but without context it's unclear. \\"Became healthy\\" could also be misleading as although there could be educational health programs, incessant TV watching is often linked to an unhealthy, sedentary lifestyle in kids. Therefore, \\"distracting\\" stands out as the best choice from the options, considering the acknowledged negative impacts excessive TV watching can have on the overall development of children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - after using water - after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - after using soap A:","completion":"After using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Although makeup can be great for hiding acne, it can also cause breakouts. Over applying makeups or using particularly oily products can clog your pores and lead to infections. If you are getting breakouts on certain parts of your face, try a different product and see if it clears up. In general, try to use products that are oil-free or noncomedogenic. You should also look for makeups that contain acne-fighting ingredients. Always remove your makeup before you go to bed. If your skin is particularly oily, you may need to use a special makeup remover instead of simply washing your face. If you suffer from breakouts on your forehead, scalp, neck, and back, the culprit may be your hair products. Products like gels, pomades, and sprays tend to block pores and irritate your skin. They can also cause allergic reactions that can result in acne. To avoid acne, experiment with different products to find one that does not irritate your skin. In general, look for products with shorter and more natural ingredient lists. In particular, look for products that are fragrance-free and noncomedogenic (non-pore clogging). To avoid using too much product, consider washing your hair two or three times a week or rinse it with conditioner daily. You might also want to consider sleeping with your hair up to avoid rolling around in your dirty hair all night. If you believe that you are having an allergic reaction to a certain product, quit using it and talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. You may want to be tested so you know what to avoid in the future. Because your hands come in contact with numerous objects during the day, they can transfer countless bacteria to your face, resulting in breakouts. If you rest your head in your hands, you may get breakouts on your chin or cheeks. To avoid this, wash your hands regularly and try to touch your face as little as possible. If you tend to get breakouts around your nose, your glasses may be the culprit. Your glasses house bacteria that can cause infections. In addition, they rub and put pressure on your skin, which can irritate it and stimulate oil production. If your glasses are causing you acne, consider using a spot treatment or ditching your glasses entirely and wear contacts. Be sure to regularly clean the nose pads of your glasses by washing them with hot soapy water. This remove any bacteria that might cause a breakout. Whenever you pull hairs from a follicle, you create an opening that is susceptible to infection. If you have your eyebrows plucked or any facial hair waxed, such as around your mouth and chin, you might see some breakouts. To avoid this, limit how often you pluck or wax any facial hairs. Shaving can have a similar effect, especially if you use a dull razor that pulls the hairs from the follicle instead of cutting them. Try sugaring or threading as alternatives to plucking or waxing. If you must pluck or wax your hair, use some basic precautions to avoid potential breakouts: Gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin before plucking or waxing. Use an anti-microbial pre-wax cleanser. Carefully clean your hands and nails before plucking and waxing, and wear disposable gloves during waxing and cleanup. Cleanse again after plucking or waxing, and gently exfoliate the next day. Keep the freshly waxed or plucked areas clean and free from sweat, dirt, or irritating products. Because most people take them everywhere (even to the bathroom) and touch them constantly, cellular phones are covered in bacteria. Whenever you talk on your phones, you are rubbing those bacteria all over your face. This can lead to breakouts on your cheeks and chin. To avoid any phone-related breakouts, consider using your phone's speaker function or getting a hands-free Bluetooth headpiece. You can also minimize phone-related breakouts by regularly cleaning your phone with antibacterial wipes. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, makeup and certain hair products can cause acne breakouts due to clogged pores, infections, and allergic reactions. To prevent acne, use oil-free, noncomedogenic, and fragrance-free products, and remove makeup before going to bed. Washing hair a few times a week and sleeping with it up can also help. Avoid touching your face with dirty hands, and clean glasses regularly to prevent breakouts around the nose. Plucking, waxing, and shaving can cause breakouts, so try alternative hair removal methods or take extra precautions before and after hair removal. Lastly, mobile phones carry bacteria that cause breakouts; using the speaker function or cleaning the phone with antibacterial wipes can help prevent acne."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ambassador Susan Rice is the leading contender to become the White House’s new national security adviser, following a failed bid to become secretary of state, a senior Obama administration official told Fox News this weekend. President Obama could appoint Rice without the Senate confirmation needed for a Cabinet post. Rice withdrew herself from consideration for the secretary of state post in the face of withering criticism by congressional Republicans and others for her handling of the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, Libya terror attacks. Five days after the attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, Rice said the attacks appeared spontaneous and sparked by an anti-Islamic video. Rice, 48, later said she gave an incorrect account, based on intelligence reports at the time. However, subsequent meetings with leading Senate Republicans appeared only to increase her lack of support for the Cabinet post. This weekend, the administration official told Fox a Rice appointment is not imminent because the president still has to find an ambassadorship or another post for current National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon. Fox first reported last year, shortly after the outcome of the November elections, that Rice might get the NSA post –- under the assumption Donilon might become the new White House chief of staff. Donilon did not get the job so the president must first find a new post for him before moving Rice.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What much was surpassed in the 20th century?\\" is in \\"Over the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five, much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What much was surpassed in the 20th century?\\" can be found in the given passage. Over the course of the 20th century, significant advancements and growth were observed in various aspects of human life, including economics, technology, and medicine. Firstly, the world's per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a factor of five during the 20th century. This growth was much more than all earlier centuries combined, including the 19th century, which is known for its Industrial Revolution. This implies that the economic progress made during the 20th century greatly surpassed that of previous centuries, making it a period of remarkable growth and development. Another important aspect highlighted in the passage is the role of technology and its impact on human life. The passage contends that many economists believe that the mere economic growth figures might actually understate the true magnitude of development that occurred during the 20th century. One reason for this is the availability and consumption of various goods and services at the end of the 20th century that were unimaginable at its beginning. Improved medicine, for instance, led to a significant increase in global life expectancy, which rose by more than two decades. Communications technologies also underwent a massive transformation, revolutionizing the way people connected with each other. However, the passage also indicates that the 20th century witnessed a widening gap between the rich and the poor. While considerable progress was made in various fields, the majority of the global population remained on the poorer side of this divide. This implies that the benefits and advancements of the 20th century were not evenly distributed or accessible to everyone. In summary, the 20th century surpassed earlier centuries in terms of economic growth, technological advancements, and improvements in medicine. However, this progress was accompanied by a growing economic divide between the rich and the poor, which left the majority of the global population struggling to access the benefits arising from these advancements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 - September 14, 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the first half of the 19th century. His historical romances draw a picture of frontier and American Indian life in the early American days which created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and contributed generously to it. James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, most of whom died during infancy or childhood. He was descended from James Cooper of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, who immigrated to the American colonies in 1679. Shortly after James' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York that had previously been occupied by the Iroquois, who had allied themselves with the British during the Revolutionary War and were forced to cede the territory after British defeat. The State of New York opened the land for sale and development after the war, and Cooper's father purchased several thousand acres in upstate along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten. Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student's door -- after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him on an officer's warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson. At 20, Cooper inherited a fortune from his father. He married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811 at age 21. She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. She and her father often edited each other's work. Among his descendants was Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899-1970), who also became a writer.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did they side with","completion":"The text provided does not have any article with a quote to answer the question \\"Who did they side with.\\" If you could provide the article, I would be more than happy to provide the quote and answer the question accordingly."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer a question about this article: Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using Latin characters and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other). What is the major limitation of traditional character encodings?","completion":"The major limitation of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, is their inability to effectively support multilingual computer processing. These character encodings were developed to accommodate the growing need for digitally representing text in different languages, but they were designed specifically for bilingual processing. This means that while they perform well when dealing with Latin characters and a local script, they struggle to handle arbitrary scripts mixed with each other. Traditional character encodings have a limited repertoire of characters – typically accommodating a specific region or a limited set of languages. As a result, they lack a unified and comprehensive character set which can address the textual needs of multiple languages simultaneously. This limitation forces computers and software systems to switch between different encodings, risking data loss, character corruption, and compatibility issues when sharing or displaying text between users with different systems, languages, or regions. Unicode was introduced to overcome these limitations by providing a universal character encoding system. It aims to assign a unique code point to every character used in written languages across the world, encompassing not only modern languages but also historical scripts and special symbols. By transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, Unicode enables more efficient, accurate, and streamlined multilingual computing, allowing computer processing of various scripts mixed seamlessly with one another. This benefits users, developers, and industries by promoting easier communication, preserving the integrity of textual content, and reducing the complexity of multilingual software development."},{"prompt":"Gary and Joe are two farmers.

Upon considering these options, they decided to disassemble the table. They carefully removed each part, ensuring that no damage was done. They then carried the individual parts through the narrow doorway and reassembled the table once inside. In conclusion, they were able to get the table into the house by analyzing the situation and finding a viable solution.

Lawrence or Diana Athill? The answer is:","completion":"The scope of profession for T. E. Lawrence and Diana Athill depends on the criteria being assessed. T. E. Lawrence, also known as Lawrence of Arabia, was a British archaeologist, military officer, diplomat, and writer. His profession had a significant impact on international relations, military strategy, and archaeology. His role in the Middle East during World War I influenced the region's politics even into the 21st century. Diana Athill, on the other hand, was a distinguished English literary editor, novelist, and memoirist with a career spanning over six decades. She played a significant role in the British literary scene, working with writers like V. S. Naipaul and Jean Rhys and shaping their manuscripts into polished literary works. In terms of the scope of profession, it could be argued that T. E. Lawrence had a more pronounced impact on international affairs and military history, while Diana Athill's work was influential in the literary sphere.

Nigerians turn out en masse to vote in tight presidential election ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigerians turned out en masse to vote in a presidential election Saturday that analysts say is too close to call between President Goodluck Jonathan and former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari. A car bomb exploded at a polling station in south-central Enugu state but police said none of the voters lining up was hurt in the 7:30 a.m. blast. Current president Goodluck Jonathan (left) and opposition candidate Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, shake hands after signing a renewal of their pledge to hold peaceful “free, fair and credible” elections.Photo: AP Police detonated two other car bombs at the scene, a primary school, said Enugu state police Commissioner Dan Bature. The explosion occurred far from the northeastern center of the Islamic uprising by Nigeria’s home-grown Boko Haram. Voters in the oil-rich south who traditionally support President Goodluck Jonathan could determine the outcome of the first election in Nigeria’s history where an opposition candidate has a realistic chance of defeating a sitting president. Polling stations opened late in many areas as official rushed across the country delivering ballot materials by trucks, speedboats, motorcycles, mules and even camels, in the case of a northern mountaintop village, according to spokesman Kayode Idowu of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Streets are deserted. Only electoral officials, observers, security officials and media with relevant stickers are allowed to use the roads. All sea and land borders are closed as a security precaution.

Jonathan and Buhari are front-runners among 14 candidates who want to govern Africa’s most populous nation beset by a northeastern Islamic uprising. Buhari, resplendent in white robes, was the first voter to have his fingerprints taken at a polling station that opened a half hour late in Daura, his hometown in northern Katsina state. The registration of Jonathan, in black with his trademark Fedora hat, was delayed in the southern oil-rich state of Bayelsa. Three newly imported card readers failed to recognize his fingerprints, and his wife’s. He returned two hours later and was accredited without the machine. Biometric cards and readers are being used for the first time to discourage the kind of fraud that has marred previous votes. Afterward, Jonathan wiped sweat from his brow and urged people to be patient as he had, telling Channels TV: “I appeal to all Nigerians to be patient no matter the pains it takes as long as if, as a nation, we can conduct free and fair elections that the whole world will accept.” Trader Angela Okele expressed concern after getting accredited in Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s southern oil capital. “The process is too slow, if it continues like this many people will not be able to cast their votes today,” she said. Men sing and hold up their ID cards as they wait in line at a polling station in Kano. Biometric cards and readers are being used for the first time to discourage the kind of fraud that has marred previous votes, but many have expressed concern that the process is much too slow.Photo: Reuters Electoral officials stressed that once voting starts it will not end until the last person in line has voted, even if it takes all night. At Jere, a town 38 miles north of Abuja, electoral officials said they had only one card reader, which has a capacity for about 700 voters, and twice as many people lined up. An official was sent by motorcycle to collect another. This is only the eighth election since Nigeria’s independence from Britain in 1960. In a country steeped in a history of military coups and bloodshed caused by politics, ethnicity, land disputes, oil theft and, lately, the Boko Haram Islamic uprising, the election is important as Africa’s richest nation consolidates its democracy. An elderly woman holds up her voter registration card. Polling stations opened late in many areas as official rushed across the country delivering ballot materials by trucks, speedboats, motorcycles, mules and even camels.Photo: Getty Images There’s a lot of international interest, especially among nervous foreign investors as Nigeria is Africa’s largest destination for direct foreign investment. Its oil-dependent economy is hurting from slashed petroleum prices. Nigeria’s military announced Friday it had destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram’s so-called Islamic caliphate and driven the insurgents from all major areas in northeast Nigeria, a claim that seems unlikely. There was no way to verify the report. Critics of Jonathan have said recent military victories after months of ceding territory to the Islamic extremists are a ploy to win votes — a charge the presidential campaign denies. The failure of Jonathan’s administration to curb the insurgency, which killed about 10,000 people last year, has angered many Nigerians especially in the north. International outrage has grown over another failure — the rescue of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram nearly a year ago. The extremists have abducted hundreds more since then, using them as sex slaves and fighters. Jonathan and Buhari on Thursday signed a peace pledge and promised to accept the results of a free and fair election. But already dozens have been killed amid hate speech highlighting the religious, ethnic and geographic divisions among Nigerians. Voters from an Internally Displaced People camp, who fled areas affected by Boko Haram violence, line up at a polling station in Maiduguri. Electoral officials have stressed that voting will not end until the very last person in line has voted.Photo: Getty Images The Islamic uprising has exacerbated relations between Christians like Jonathan, who dominate the oil-rich south, and Muslims like Buhari who are the majority in the agricultural and cattle-herding lands of the north. The population of 170 million is almost evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. Some 1,000 people were killed in rioting after Buhari lost to Jonathan in the 2011 elections. Thousands of Nigerians and foreign workers have left the country amid fears of post-election violence. In 2011, there was no doubt that Jonathan had swept the polls by millions of votes. Now the race is much closer. The game-changer that transformed Nigeria’s political landscape came two years ago when the main opposition parties formed a coalition and for the first time united behind one candidate, Buhari. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Here's the important parts of the story explained like I'm talking to a five year old: A very important event happened in Nigeria, a big country in Africa, where people were deciding who they wanted to be their big leader, the president. The two main people who could become the president were a man named Goodluck Jonathan, who was already the president, and another man named Muhammadu Buhari. Lots and lots of people came out to vote. Voting is when people pick who they want to be their leader. Sometimes, these people had to wait in long lines before they could vote. There were some scary parts too. There were car bombs at one place where people were supposed to vote. Car bombs are very dangerous and can hurt people but thankfully, no one got hurt. To stop any kind of cheating during voting, special cards and machines were used. But these new machines made the voting process a bit slow. But the officials said that everyone who wanted to vote can vote, even if it takes all day and night. This election was important because Nigeria has had some difficult times because of violence and people not getting along. The results of this vote could change a lot of things. It's a bit like when we decide on a new game to play, it could change the way we all play together. Also, a bad group called Boko Haram has been causing trouble in the country and the current president, Mr. Jonathan, has been criticized for not being able to stop them. So, people's votes might also be influenced by how they feel about that. It's just like when you choose to play with the kid who promises to stop the school bully. Lastly, this is one of the first times that the opponent, Mr. Buhari, has a good chance of winning against the current president.

The UN human rights chief on Monday slammed Myanmar's apparent \\"systematic attack\\" on the Rohingya minority, warning that \\"ethnic cleansing\\" seemed to be underway. \\"Because Myanmar has refused access to human rights investigators the current situation cannot yet be fully assessed, but the situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,\\" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council. The Rohingya are reviled in Myanmar, where the roughly one million-strong community are accused of being illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations says 294,000 bedraggled and exhausted Rohingya refugees have arrived in Bangladesh since the militants' attacks on Myanmar security forces in neighbouring Rakhine state on August 25 sparked a major military backlash. Tens of thousands more are believed to be on the move inside Rakhine after more than two weeks without shelter, food and water. \\"The operation... is clearly disproportionate and without regard for basic principles of international law,\\" Zeid said. \\"We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,\\" he said. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemns Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi's government has come in for strong international criticism over the military's treatment of the Rohingya. \\"I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,\\" Zeid said. He said he was particularly \\"appalled\\" by reports that Myanmar authorities had begun laying landmines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent those who fled from returning. He also criticised \\"official statements that refugees who have fled the violence will only be allowed back if they can provide 'proof of nationality',\\" pointing out that Myanmar since 1962 had been stripping Rohingyas of a wide range of rights, including citizenship rights. \\"This measure resembles a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return,\\" he said. Zeid urged the Myanmar government to \\"stop pretending that the Rohingyas are setting fire to their own homes and laying waste to their own villages.\\" \\"This complete denial of reality is doing great damage to the international standing of a government which, until recently, benefited from immense good will,\\" he said, calling on authorities to allow his office access to investigate the situation in the country.

Speaking as she visited a refugee camp, Sheikh Hasina urged Myanmar to view the situation with humanity, saying innocent people were suffering. Some 370,000 Rohingyas have crossed the border since violence began last month. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies it is targeting civilians. But many of those who have fled say troops responded to attacks by Rohingya militants on 25 August with a brutal campaign of violence and village burnings aimed at driving them out. The BBC has spoken to Rohingyas maimed by landmines as they fled Myanmar. Bangladeshi sources say Myanmar's army recently planted new mines - an allegation denied by Myanmar officials. The Rohingyas, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants. Bangladesh is already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Myanmar. Its two official refugee camps are full and aid agencies say the new arrivals desperately need food, shelter and medical help. 'These people... are suffering' Sheikh Hasina's comments came as she visited the Kutupalong camp, one of the official camps. \\"My personal message is very clear, that they should consider this situation with the eyes of humanity,\\" she told the BBC.

About 32,000 registered refugees live in the two official camps, but more than 300,000 undocumented Rohingyas were also estimated to be in Bangladesh before this latest influx. Bangladesh says their presence strains local resources, increases crime and deters tourists in the Cox's Bazar area. Earlier this year, it backed a plan to transfer them to an island in the Bay of Bengal, Thengar Char, but rights groups said the island was unfit for human habitation due to seasonal flooding. International condemnation grows Myanmar is facing mounting criticism over the Rohingya crisis and there have been protests in several Muslim-majority nations. UN human rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein said on Monday that the security operation in Rakhine appeared to be \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\".

But China, which competes for influence in its southern neighbor with the United States, said it backed Myanmar’s efforts to safeguard “development and stability”. The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians. The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state. The top U.N. human rights official denounced Myanmar on Monday for conducting a “cruel military operation” against Rohingya, branding it “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. The United States said the violent displacement of the Rohingya showed Myanmar’s security forces were not protecting civilians. Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar’s transition from decades of harsh military rule that is being led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. “We call on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities,” the White House said in a statement. Myanmar government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but the foreign ministry said shortly before the U.S. statement was issued that Myanmar was also concerned about the suffering. Its forces were carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order in response to acts of extremism. “The government of Myanmar fully shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest escalation of violence ignited by the acts of terrorism,” the ministry said in a statement. Myanmar’s government regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations. Attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), on police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked the military counter-offensive that refugees say is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of the country. A similar but smaller wave of attacks by the same insurgents last October also sparked what critics called a heavy-handed response by the security forces that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. Reports from refugees and rights groups paint a picture of widespread attacks on Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine by the security forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who have put numerous Muslim villages to the torch. But Myanmar authorities have denied that the security forces, or Buddhist civilians, have been setting the fires, instead blaming the insurgents. Nearly 30,000 Buddhist villagers have also been displaced, they say. ‘STOP THE VIOLENCE’ The U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time during the crisis since Aug. 25. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council on the crisis. “It is important that the Security Council plays its role in responding,” said Sweden’s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog said on Tuesday. Britain and Sweden requested the meeting. However, rights groups slammed the 15-member council for not holding a public meeting. Diplomats have said China and Russia would likely object to such a move and protect Myanmar if there was any push for council action to try and end the crisis.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui “This is ethnic cleansing on a large scale it seems, and the Security Council can’t open its doors and stand in front of the cameras? It’s appalling, frankly,” Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau told reporters on Tuesday. Sherine Tadros, head Amnesty International in New York, said if the council doesn’t act “the price is being paid.” “The danger is without some sort of public proclamation by Security Council members ... the message that you’re sending to the Myanmar government is deadly, and they will continue to do it,” Tadros told reporters. The exodus to Bangladesh shows no sign of slowing with 370,000 the latest estimate, according to a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman, up from an estimate of 313,000 on the weekend. Bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingyas. Many refugees are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season. The United Nations said 200,000 children needed urgent support. Two emergency flights organized by the U.N. refugee agency arrived in Bangladesh with aid for about 25,000 refugees. More flights are planned with the aim of helping 120,000, a spokesman said. Worry is also growing about conditions inside Rakhine State, with fears a hidden humanitarian crisis may be unfolding. Myanmar has rejected a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid there, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists. But Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable the refugees to go home. “Myanmar will have to take back all Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh,” Hasina said on a visit to the Cox’s Bazar border district where she distributed aid. Slideshow (12 Images) “Myanmar has created the problem and they will have to solve it,” she said, adding: “We want peaceful relations with our neighbors, but we can’t accept any injustice. “Stop this violence against innocent people.” Myanmar has said those who can verify their citizenship can return but most Rohingya are stateless. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, “The international community should support Myanmar in its efforts to safeguard development and stability.” ||||| [versi Bahasa Indonesia] In the past week, it has been reported that the military under Aung San Suu Kyi’s Government of Myanmar has been attacking the predominantly muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine, Myanmar. According to the reports, the Rohingyas — including women and children — have been killed and physically tortured. According to the European Rohingya Council (ERC), 3,000 Rohingyas have been killed within three days between 25 and 27 August, 2017. Their villages have been burned to the ground. The military claimed that this was an effort to eliminate terrorism. Until this second, the de facto ruler of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has done virtually nothing to stop this crime against humanity in her country. As a result, there are many of the Rohingyas fled their homes and are stranded in the Myanmar’s border with Bangladesh. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported that there are at least 18,445 Rohingya refugees currently fled the area (bbc.com). But Suu Kyi as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate appears to be deaf and have done nothing to protect her citizens. Meanwhile, in 2013, Suu Kyi made a controversial statement that appeared to be anti-Islam. “No one told me that I was to be interviewed by a muslim.” This statement was made by Aung San Suu Kyi, after her interview by a BBC Today anchor, Mishal Husain, in 2013. Suu Kyi’s disappointment may be caused by the question asked by Husain on the hardships experienced by muslims in Myanmar. Suu Kyi was also asked to condemn the anti-muslims and those who acted violently against the muslims that led the Rohingyas to leave Myanmar (from Popham, Peter, Journalist for The Independent, The Lady and The Generals — Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma’s Struggle for Freedom, 2016). Many people were caught by surprise that those words came from Suu Kyi, a democracy hero in Myanmar and a 2012 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. It might only be one racially-insensitive sentence, but that was one sentence too many, and the meaning is too much for those who love peace. Many people in many countries, including in Indonesia, respect and admire Suu Kyi. She is known as a figure of patience, of peace loving, who eventually took back the power in her country peacefully from the military dictatorship in Myanmar. Her statement made many more disappointed and angry. This opens up the prevailing question regarding Suu Kyi’s position on the muslim minority in Myanmar. There has been no official position from Suu Kyi with regards to the human right violations that have been rampant as experienced by the Rohingya minority. Over the past three years more than 140,000 Rohingya muslims have been living in grave conditions in refugee camps in Myanmar and in many other countries, including Indonesia. What is wrong with being a muslim, Suu Kyi? Doesn't democracy and human rights teach us to respect differences in beliefs and celebrate brotherhood and sisterhood? Whatever the religion, shouldn’t Suu Kyi and all of us respect each other and not discriminate against other human beings? Coming from a democratic hero, one racist statement is one too many. It destroys the democratic values that respects differences in beliefs. As a laureate of Nobel Peace Prize, a racist statement renders the peaceful values to be artificial, giving rise to suspicions even conflicts. The Nobel Prize is the highest prize only to be given to “people who have given their utmost to international brotherhood and sisterhood.” These peaceful values need to be nurtured by the laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize, including Suu Kyi, until their last days. When a laureate cannot maintain peace, then for the sake of peace itself the prize needs to be returned or confiscated by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Therefore, we hereby demand the Chair of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee confiscate or take back the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi. Only those who are serious in keeping the world peace may be awarded such a coveted Prize. ---- This petition is initiated and supported by Emerson Yuntho; Hamid Basyaib; Agus Sari; Nong Darol Mahmada; Ulin Yusron; Zainal Arifin Mochtar; Saidiman Ahmad; Ahmad Mukhlis Yusuf; Teguh Juwarno; Syamsul Munir; Naufal Firman Yursak; Kusfuardi; Ahmad Farhan; Andi Harianto Sinulingga; Andy Budiman; Goenawan Mohamad; Bonnie Triyana; Berly Martawardaya; Iwan Gunawan; Mirwan Bz Vauly; Effendi Ishak; Tatat Rahmita Utami; Fajar R.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who does Lowell speak to constantly, as if they are children? is inside the article: It is implied that, in the future, all plant life on Earth has become extinct. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous, greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to a large spaceship named \\"Valley Forge\\", forming part of a fleet of American Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn. Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen. Enlisting the aid of the ship's three \\"drones\\" (service robots), Huey, Dewey and Louie (named after Donald Duck's nephews), Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 (Louie) is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell and the surviving drones, Huey and Dewey, set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, Lowell speaks constantly to the ship's three \\"drones\\" - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as if they are children.

Is \\"ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What is the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP?\\"","completion":"The provided answer is not the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP, as it focuses mainly on ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) and their relationship with multiple upstream ISPs. Instead, the simplest case can be described by focusing on a single ISP with just one point of presence connecting to an upstream provider. Here's a detailed explanation of the simplest case: The simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves an Internet Service Provider (ISP) having only one Point of Presence (PoP) connecting to a single upstream ISP for their internet connectivity. In this scenario, the smaller ISP (also known as a downstream ISP) relies on a larger, upstream ISP to provide them with access to the global internet and to route their traffic accordingly. The connection between the two ISPs is typically established through a dedicated, high-speed physical link, such as a fiber optic cable. This enables the smaller ISP to extend its network coverage and offer its subscribers internet access. The relationship between the two ISPs is often governed by a contractual agreement known as a peering or transit agreement. These agreements outline the commercial terms, technical specifications, and service level agreements (SLAs) necessary for the ISPs to interconnect and exchange traffic efficiently. In the simplest case, the smaller ISP does not have multiple PoPs, nor does it have connections to multiple upstream ISPs. Instead, it relies solely on the single upstream ISP for its entire internet connectivity, making it vulnerable to potential issues related to the performance or reliability of the upstream ISP's network. The arrangement also limits the smaller ISP's control and flexibility in managing its traffic flow and routing decisions since they depend largely on their upstream provider. Moreover, it may affect the smaller ISP's ability to negotiate competitive service rates and terms due to the lack of alternatives. In summary, the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves a downstream ISP having just one point of presence, which is connected to a single upstream ISP for its global internet connectivity. This arrangement is characterized by a direct physical connection and a contractual relationship between the ISPs, but it may expose the smaller ISP to potential risks related to network reliability, performance, and limited control over routing decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeb Bush in Washington. (Reuters/AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

Moore, Jr., R.I.P. ARE MITT AND JEB GETTING READY TO RUMBLE? When Jeb Bush jumped in the presidential pond, it was widely assumed that it would mean the end of speculation about a possible third run for Mitt Romney. But not only has Romney continued to entertain pleas from advisers to run again, according to two senior staffers from Romney’s 2012 campaign, Bush’s exploratory move hasn’t changed the landscape for Romney that much. Romney huddled with top advisers in California on Wednesday, a group that reportedly was to include big names like Ben Ginsberg, Andrea Saul and Lanhee Chen. While we can’t know exactly what was said, top aides who spoke to Fox News First prior to the conclave said that Bush’s build-out isn’t a factor. One said that Bush and Romney were “fishing in different pools” of donors and could both proceed with explorations. The other pointed out that not even Bush would be likely to equal Romney’s potential fundraising haul. By continuing to entertain the entreaties of an increasingly enthusiastic circle of advisers, though, Romney is putting himself on a collision course with Bush. There may be enough money for both of them, but not enough votes. A shot across the bow? - Politico reports that former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is preparing to release a decade or more of personal tax returns. While others say such a bold move is “grossly premature,” there’s no doubt that Bush will be expansive in his disclosures. If and when such a move happens it is seen by many as an early way to distance himself from 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney who came under fire for such a limited release of his own returns. Romney’s first release came in late January 2012 after the undisclosed returns helped cost him the South Carolina primary. Another release came in late September 2012, a few weeks after the Republican Convention. Romney refused to go further, but offered a summary of information from the previous 20 years as prepared by Pricewaterhouse Coopers. BAIER TRACKS: PERRY 2.0… “Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry is making every move to suggest that he is running for president again. He’s hitting the trail hard in early primary states, but more importantly, Perry is touting the fact that he’s been shuttling in a broad array of policy experts to Austin to bone up. I traveled to Texas before Christmas to interview the governor and visit the southern border with him. We talked about his policy workshops, which Perry calls “listening sessions” but certainly sound like cramming for a presidential exam. Tonight on ‘Special Report,’ we’ll share that interview as part our series examining the ‘2016 Presidential Contenders.’ We’ll cover all aspects of a possible Perry run: recovering from the ‘oops’ moment, his confrontation with President Obama over immigration, his legal issues and his prescription for Texas-style prosperity for America.” - Bret Baier.

Scott Walker wasn’t just Twitter trolling his potential 2016 GOP presidential rivals on Wednesday. Walker has brought aboard one of the most sought-after presidential strategists for this cycle, Rick Wiley. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last week, Walker suggested for his potential presidential run he would hire someone he knew but had not worked closely with. Wiley fits that bill. Wiley, who is based in Austin, Texas, served as the political director and later executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, and then went on to serve in a top position in Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. From there, Wiley went to work for the Republican National Committee, eventually serving as political director.

Republicans have traditionally done a good job collecting small donations via direct mail, but email is many times cheaper. On top of that, an early start building an email list may be critical for whoever actually wins the nomination. None of this is lost on high-profile GOP hopefuls including Sen.

Asked on “The Kelly File” about White House’s initial ambivalence to call the onslaught a terrorist attack and whether there is a conscious decision not to link these types of attacks to Islam, McConnell told Megyn Kelly, “They refuse to call these attacks what they are.” “These are terrorist attacks invariably spawned by some perverted notion of Islam and to not call it what it is strikes me as not being forthcoming with the American people” Watch the interview here. [Watch the second part of McConnell’s interview on “The Kelly File” tonight at 9 p.m. ET] Unhappy precedent - David Harsanyi at The Federalist: “After the horrific and deadly terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, France, it’s worth remembering again that there is no conciliatory rhetoric or kowtowing that will stop attacks on our liberal values. They won’t stop even if we give in, which is something we’ve done. It’s something we do quite often. Surely you remember that the “Innocence of Muslims” fiasco didn’t end in Egypt. U.S. taxpayers paid for television ads in Pakistan featuring footage of Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during press a press conference – subtitled in Urdu – condemning the film. ‘We absolutely reject its content and message,’ Clinton explained. Bro-ster Tommy Vietor, then spokesman for the National Security Council, told the Washington Post that the White House has ‘reached out to YouTube to call the video to their attention and ask them to review whether it violates their terms of use.’ And due to this pressure – what amounts to no less than de facto censorship – YouTube pulled the video. The man ended up in prison and the extremists won.” A pox on media mice - Peter Beinart at The Atlantic: “But because these assaults aim to intimidate movie studios and journalists, their impact cannot be measured merely by how governments respond. Historically, terrorists and dictators have often used violence to blackmail democratic governments into changing policy. Now they are using violence to blackmail editors and studio heads into doing so. Which means that journalists and media executives, rather than merely politicians, must choose either appeasement or defiance. By first refusing to disseminate The Interview, and then agreeing to, Sony pivoted from the former to the latter. With most of its staff murdered, Charlie Hebdo itself may, tragically, not have the choice. But in deciding whether to show the images that seem to have gotten Charlie Hebdo’s cartoonists and editors killed, countless other magazines, newspapers, websites, and television networks will be acting as either hawks or doves.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Today would have been Elvis Presley’s 80th birthday and one might wonder what the King of Rock and Roll would be like today had he not died in August 1977 at age 42. Well, consider this: On December 4, 1956 there was an impromptu jam session at Sun Records Memphis studios included Elvis and three other rockabilly pioneers: Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Louis. That session and the famous photo of the four would come to be known as the Million Dollar Quartet. So to guess where The King would be today we can look at what became of the other three, who shared similar backgrounds and sadly, similar demons. Perkins, with the help of Cash, eventually confronted his alcoholism and, after a career tailspin died at age 65, esteemed by all of rock and country music as a legend. Cash has one of the best known stories of loss, redemption and love, written with his beloved wife, June Carter Cash. The Man in Black, who died at 71 in 2003, was still recording and innovating up until the end. The last rockabilly still rocking though is The Killer. Jerry Lee Louis is the subject of new book from Rick Bragg and the author makes it clear that Louis is still struggling with the same tempestuous soul that churned within him even on the day he stood with those three other giants.

House Republican leaders huddled with rank and file Wednesday in Washington to develop strategies to block the president’s executive action granting temporary amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. The Hill: “Gathered in the Capitol office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy [R-Calif.], the Republicans discussed a handful of different GOP proposals designed to prevent Obama’s order from taking effect. Emerging from that meeting, the lawmakers said they haven’t settled on a final design surrounding either the policy or the strategy for moving the language through the lower chamber.

A final rule was due by law on Jan. 8, a year after it was first proposed. But the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it would wait until midsummer, and issue the new power plant rules with a separate regulation aimed at cutting the pollution blamed for global warming from the existing coal-fired power fleet. That would put the rule weeks past the deadline set by President Barack Obama when he announced his second-term plans for climate in June 2013…Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] has vowed to overturn the emissions rules in short order to halt what he views as a war on coal, an industry important to his state but in decline there.” States will be forced to comply - NYT: “The Environmental Protection Agency will force states to comply with a federal “model rule” to cut their carbon emissions if the states do not submit customized plans under the Obama administration’s new climate change regulations, a senior official said Wednesday.” A.G. confirmation hearings set - Politico:“Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley [R-Iowa] plans to hold confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in the last week of January or the beginning of February, an aide said Wednesday. ‘He has spoken with the White House Counsel about this goal, and the White House was agreeable to this timetable,’ Grassley’s spokeswoman, Beth Levine, said in an email. The nomination of Lynch, who was chosen late last year to replace outgoing attorney general Eric Holder, will be one of the highest profile confirmations that the new GOP majority in the Senate will take up early this year.” Reid ramps up for 2016 challenge - The Hill: “Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s [D-Nev.] chief of staff David Krone is stepping down although he will still advise Reid, according to a source familiar with the staff shakeup. The source said Krone will be replaced by Drew Willison, a longtime senior aide to Reid who recently served as Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. The source added that Krone ‘will have a major role’ on Reid’s re-election campaign. The move dovetails with Reid’s plans to run for re-election in 2016 because Willison oversaw important legislative projects for Nevada while serving as a senior aide on the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee…” THE JUDGE’S RULING: Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano illustrates how over the past 100 years the country has been on a slow steady march toward the federal destruction of the presumption of liberty: “…on the transcendental issues of our day -- life, liberty, war and debt -- the leadership of both political parties and the behavior of all modern presidents have revealed a steadfast willingness to write any law and regulate any behavior or permit any evil, whether authorized by the Constitution or not.” WARREN AIMS TO SHAPE DEBATE AS 2016 RACE BEGINS AP: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] on Wednesday hammered Washington's leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, for failing to help middle-class workers since the 1980s. Left unsaid: That time period includes President Bill Clinton's administration. As Warren continues to insist she won't run for president, and all of politics is waiting for Hillary Rodham Clinton to announce her candidacy, it was a notable omission during Warren's speech at a conference sponsored by the AFL-CIO. Bill Clinton famously declared ‘the era of big government is over’ in 1996, and Warren's indictment of three decades of economic policy referenced complaints among liberals that the policies of Democrats contributed to Wall Street excess in the past decade…That sort of rhetoric has some liberals pining for Warren to enter the Democratic presidential contest, a move that would likely pit her against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the party's leading contender should she enter the campaign as is widely expected.” Podesta gets ready for Hillary kick off - WaPo: “White House counselor John Podesta will leave the White House next month, according to a senior administration official, and will help Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential bid… Clinton is likely to announce her intention to seek the Oval Office this spring, according to her advisers and Democratic strategists.” ARCH A. MOORE, JR., R.I.P. Ed. note: It was my great privilege, sometimes frustration and always fascination to cover former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore. When I came to know and ultimately befriend the former three-term Republican governor, he was seeking the restoration of his law license following completion of his sentence for corruption charges. While I thought Moore’s admirers quite right that what he had done to keep his political machine going was less bad than many Democrats had gotten away with, I resented the argument that West Virginia should somehow accept a lower threshold for public corruption. But at least he did not steal from the public. His crimes were rooted in ambition, not greed or weakness – and there was no denying that his ambition was tied to a deep love for the state I adore. Arch was, like all of us, a complicated contradiction. What made us friends, though, was that he loved and understood politics more than almost anyone I had ever known. In hour after hour of phone calls, even at 75, he was scalpel-sharp and crackling with energy. Arch lived to see his daughter elected in a landslide to the Senate and his beloved West Virginia awash in a sea of red in November, ending finally the New Deal Democrat coalition that ruled the state for four generations. It would have surely pleased him, but I doubt it would have surprised him. He could see around corners better than most of us. As to why I ultimately came to admire him, it was his refusal to be defeated. He was truly a brave man. So he should probably be best remembered not for what he did in office or politics but for what he did before he ever won his first vote: Charleston Daily Mail: “In November 1944, during a battle near Aachen, Germany, a machine-gun bullet hit Moore, then an infantry sergeant, in the face.

Greeks: Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island's colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s.

Guru Pitka is the #2 Guru in the world, after Deepak Chopra. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin.

Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents. Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the differences between asexual and sexual reproduction. - Asexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by a single parent and inherit all their traits from that single parent. - Sexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by the combination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in a mix of inherited traits from both parents. Step 2: Analyze the given information. - Billy: Born by asexual reproduction. Parent has Horkrumatis. As he inherits all traits from the single parent, this includes the genetic disease. - Jimmy: Born by sexual reproduction. One parent has Horkrumatis. Jimmy's chance of inheriting the disease depends on the pattern of inheritance of the disease, but generally, his risk of having it is reduced because he also inherits traits from the other parent who doesn't have the disease. Step 3: Determine which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis. As Billy has inherited all his traits from his parent with Horkrumatis, he has a higher chance of having the disease. In contrast, Jimmy has a lower chance because he derives genes from both parents, which serves to dilute the risk of carrying the genetic disease, assuming that it is a recessive trait. If the disease is dominant, the risk of having the Horkrumatis disease in sexual reproduction will depend on the carrier status of both parents. Therefore, Jimmy (born by sexual reproduction) is less likely to have Horkrumatis compared to Billy (born by asexual reproduction)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would Remy feel as a result?\\", is \\"Glad to get a gift\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"The validity of the answer \\"Glad to get a gift\\" as a representation of Remy's feelings depends on various factors in the given situation and Remy's personal preferences and values. To fully explore this question, it is essential to consider different perspectives and potential outcomes. 1. Remy's perspective on gifts and financial priorities: If Remy is an individual who values thoughtful and meaningful gifts, they may appreciate Lee's gesture and feel happy to receive the present. In this case, the answer \\"Glad to get a gift\\" could be valid. However, should Remy place greater importance on financial responsibility and planning over receiving material possessions, they might feel more concerned about how their money was spent, diminishing the impact of the gift and making the answer less valid. 2. The nature of the relationship between Lee and Remy: The validity of the answer may also greatly depend on the dynamics between Lee and Remy, as well as the boundaries and expectations in their relationship. For instance, if Lee is a close friend or family member with a long-standing tradition of exchanging gifts, Remy might be glad to receive the gift. Conversely, if Lee and Remy have agreed on financial management and spending boundaries that were violated by the purchase, Remy could feel betrayed instead of feeling glad about the gift. 3. The significance of the occasion: The importance of the situation surrounding the exchange of the gift might also influence Remy's emotional response. If the gift is for a significant milestone such as Remy's birthday or their anniversary, Remy might appreciate the effort Lee put into selecting an appropriate gift. On the other hand, if the gift is spontaneous and unrelated to any significant event, Remy may not be as glad to receive it, making the answer less valid. 4. Remy's financial situation: Understanding Remy's financial context is another essential aspect to consider. For instance, if Remy is financially stable and can afford to have money spent on a gift, they might not mind the expense and could feel glad to receive the present. However, if Remy is struggling financially, the act of Lee spending all their money on a gift might be seen as more of a burden than a thoughtful gesture, reducing the validity of the answer. 5. The gift's personal or emotional value: Lastly, the emotional or personal significance of the gift to Remy might affect their reaction. If Lee has chosen a gift with tremendous sentimental value or a strong connection to Remy's interests or preferences, they could feel touched and grateful, making the answer valid. However, if the gift does not resonate with Remy on a deeper level or is perceived as extravagant or unnecessary, the gift's impact may be lost, and they might not be glad about receiving it. In conclusion, while it is possible that Remy could feel \\"Glad to get a gift,\\" the validity of this answer relies on numerous factors such as Remy's personal values, the nature of their relationship with Lee, the significance of the occasion, their financial situation, and the gift's emotional value. Without understanding these factors, it is difficult to determine the validity of the answer in this specific case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre?, what is it ?

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again. When Mary then goes to Uncle Albert's workshop she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called N.C. The two become close friends, and the last shot of the film shows them ice skating together.

Sleep came very naturally for Logan but not for Adam, so Choose from: [+] Logan was always very tired.. [+] Adam was always very tired..","completion":"Adam was always very tired. It was a struggle for him to go through his day without feeling the weight of his drowsiness dragging him down at every turn. Even on the best of days, when he managed to get a few hours of restless sleep, the tiredness would still cling to him as if it were a second skin, a constant reminder of his struggle. Logan, on the other hand, seemed to have an uncanny ability to sleep soundly and effortlessly, as if it were a gift he had been given at birth. Every night, he would lay his head down on his pillow and, with a few deep breaths, his eyes would gently flutter closed, and sleep would wash over him like a warm, comforting blanket. Adam couldn't help but envy his friend for the ease with which he could escape into the world of dreams, a place where the worries and stresses of the waking world simply melted away into the night. He wondered what it would be like to possess that kind of gift, but it was something he could only experience vicariously through the stories and tales of others. There were times when Adam would sit awake in the dark, his body limp from exhaustion, his thoughts a jumbled mess of fragmented ideas and desperate prayers for sleep. He would look over at Logan, peacefully snoozing away, utterly oblivious to his friend's plight, and he would feel a curious mixture of longing and resentment, a complicated concoction of emotions that left him feeling even more restless than before. Seeing that Adam was having a hard time coping with his sleeplessness, Logan tried to offer his help and advice. He suggested they establish a bedtime routine, create a relaxing environment, and explore different relaxation techniques together. They spent their evenings doing yoga, meditation, and experimenting with herbal teas, hoping that one of them would be the key to unlocking the door to a good night's sleep for Adam. After weeks of patience and perseverance, Adam began to notice small improvements in his ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. It wasn't a magic solution, and he still had many restless nights, but the progress was enough to give him hope that things might someday change for the better. Logan remained by his side, encouraging Adam through every small step of progress that came his way. While they both knew that they would never be able to share the same deep and restful sleep, the connection they shared over this struggle brought them closer together, forging a bond that no amount of tiredness could erode. As the two friends continued down this path, they learned the true value of empathy, understanding, and unwavering support. While Adam still battled with sleepless nights and overwhelming fatigue, he no longer faced this challenge alone. And that, in itself, made all the difference in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What is the christian name of the title character in the 1857 novel Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens? Answer:","completion":"The Christian name or the full name of the title character in the 1857 novel Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens is Amy Dorrit. \\"Little Dorrit\\" is a term of endearment used for Amy Dorrit, derived from her small stature and the family name Dorrit. The novel Little Dorrit focuses on the journey and life experiences of this central character, Amy Dorrit. A significant portion of her life, as depicted in the novel, is spent in the Marshalsea prison, where her father is confined due to his debts. Despite being born and raised in this grim environment, Amy Dorrit, often referred to as \\"Little Dorrit\\", exhibits a nature of self-sacrifice, kindness, and humility. This, in part, stems from her strong sense of responsibility towards her family, especially her father, whom she looks after diligently. Her interactions with the story's many characters, such as Arthur Clennam, William Dorrit, and Fanny Dorrit, are key components of the plot progression. Amy Dorrit's character plays a crucial role in highlighting the social and economic disparities prevalent in the society of that time. She also serves as a strong female protagonist, exhibiting resilience and strength in the face of adversities. She eventually gets the chance of escaping the confines of Marshalsea prison when her family inherits a fortune. But in spite of wealth and potential social elevation, Amy Dorrit remains uncorrupted and continues to display her gentle and virtuous character. The character of Amy \\"Little\\" Dorrit, as conceived by Dickens, encapsulates the spirit of endurance and kind-heartedness. Her journey from a debtor's prison to a high social standing, and her unwavering character amidst these changes, forms the emotional core of the novel. Dickens uses her character to critique societal norms and to depict the essence of humanity that prevails regardless of one's circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy. Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents. Adolescent cultural differences are especially visible in which type of autonomy?","completion":"Adolescent cultural differences are especially visible in the behavioral autonomy category.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Austin?\\", is \\"strict\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"strict\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe Austin in this context. A good parent, like Austin, demonstrates concern for their child's well-being and takes appropriate measures to teach and correct behavior when necessary. The act of grounding Lee shows that Austin is willing to enforce rules and consequences in order to guide their child towards responsible actions. Being strict denotes a balance between setting clear expectations for behavior and ensuring that consequences follow when rules are broken. In this case, Austin's decision to ground Lee suggests that he abides by a set of guidelines pertaining to what is and isn't acceptable behavior for his child. This indicates a level of discipline and consistency, qualities that are often associated with strict parenting. However, it is important to acknowledge that being strict doesn't solely define Austin as a person or a parent. There could be other aspects of his personality or parenting style that contribute to his overall character and effectiveness as a parent. For instance, he could be loving, nurturing, and supportive while also maintaining a structured environment that encourages personal growth and accountability.

(Photo: Getty Images) School officials will continue to investigate whether a Leon high-schooler should have made the cheerleading squad. A decision was initially slated for Monday, according Leon’s head cheerleading coach, Caylen Berry. Principal Billy Epting, however, said he is “reviewing the various information” and will make a decision in the coming weeks. A girl entering her senior year recently auditioned for a spot on Leon’s award-winning cheerleading team but did not make the cut during an open tryout led by coaches. Since then, one of her parents filed a complaint with the district. Chris Petley, spokesman for Leon County Schools, did not provide details about the nature of the complaint. Berry called out the district for overturning the selection process. She pointed to previous occurrences at other schools, including Lincoln High and Montford Middle. But both principals insisted the decisions regarding cheerleading teams were made at the school level and were not the result of direct district intervention. All complaints that go to the district office must be investigated, explained Ricky Bell, LCS director of Student Activities. LCS will work with school administrators and not blindly overrule decisions, Bell added. “We work to do what’s in the best interest of the student and the school,” he said.

The team’s coach says the girl fell twice during tryouts and judges voted to cut her from the team. The girl will be a senior this year and her name is not being released. The school district has overruled cheerleading judges in the past and is still deciding how to rule in this case. “I don’t know why the district feels the need to go behind the back of the coaches and the school,” said Leon cheerleading coach Caylen Berry in an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat. Leon High will compete in the National High School Cheerleading Championship in Orlando in February. The team was state runner-up last season in the large non-tumbling division. |||||Summary:","completion":"Principal Billy Epting of Leon High School is currently reviewing a decision to exclude a female student from the cheerleading team after a complaint was filed by one of the girl's parents. The school has faced previous incidents of overturned selection processes at Lincoln High and Montford Middle, but it was clarified that these decisions were made at the school level without direct district intervention. The Leon County Schools District is now investigating this particular case and working together with the school administration to resolve the issue. The female student, who will be entering her senior year, auditioned for the cheerleading team during an open tryout led by the coaches; however, she was not selected for the team. It is known that the student fell twice during the tryouts, and the judges voted to cut her from the team. In response, one of her parents filed a complaint with the district, prompting the ongoing investigation. Chris Petley, a spokesperson for Leon County Schools, hasn't provided specific details about the nature of the complaint. Critics of the district's involvement argue that the decision should be left in the hands of the coaches, with Caylen Berry, Leon’s head cheerleading coach, voicing her opinion about the district's interference. She says, “I don’t know why the district feels the need to go behind the back of the coaches and the school.” Berry has called out the district for overturning the selection process in the past. Regarding the resolution process, Ricky Bell, the LCS Director of Student Activities, explains that all complaints received by the district office must be investigated. He adds, “We work to do what’s in the best interest of the student and the school.” LCS will work alongside school administrators and, according to Bell, will not blindly overrule decisions. The outcome of the review has the potential to impact the Leon High School cheerleading team's performance in their upcoming competitions. The team was state runner-up last season in the large non-tumbling division and is scheduled to compete in the National High School Cheerleading Championship in Orlando in February. As the situation unfolds, it serves as a reminder that balancing the fairness of competitive selection processes with addressing complaints and concerns from students and parents can be a complex and delicate task for both school districts and individual schools. Ultimately, the aim of the LCS and Leon High School's administration is to make decisions that best serve the interests of not only the student in question but also the larger community and the school's reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who roars with laughter?, using the article: Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny.

What is the answer: Who designed the wedding dress for the Duchess of Cambridge?","completion":"The wedding dress worn by Catherine Middleton, now known as the Duchess of Cambridge, for her marriage to Prince William on April 29, 2011, was designed by Sarah Burton for the fashion house Alexander McQueen. Sarah Burton is a renowned British fashion designer who took over as the creative director of Alexander McQueen in May 2010, following the tragic death of the brand's founder, Lee Alexander McQueen, in February 2010. Burton had been working closely with McQueen since 1996 when she joined the brand as an intern. Over the years, she climbed the ranks within the company and became head of womenswear in 2000. Her talent for design and her collaboration on several standout collections under McQueen's guidance made her the perfect fit for continuing the brand's design legacy. The Duchess of Cambridge's dress, crafted in luxurious satin and lace, was a highly-anticipated component of the royal wedding and garnered significant attention from the international press and public alike. The dress featured an ivory and white bodice with French Chantilly lace and English Cluny lace throughout, along with a delicate floral pattern including roses, thistle, daffodils, and shamrocks, which represented England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The full skirt of the gown cascaded in gazar (a soft, smooth silk fabric), and the back was adorned with 58 gazar-covered buttons and Rouleau loops. The dress also showcased a magnificent train measuring approximately 2.7 meters (9 feet). To complement the gown, the Duchess wore a silk tulle veil embroidered with flowers and held in place by a Cartier-designed tiara, known as the 'Halo' tiara, which was lent to her by Queen Elizabeth II. The dress paid tribute to traditional British craftsmanship, while the bridal gown's modern and elegant silhouette symbolized Sarah Burton's contemporary design approach. The gown's design, inspired by Victorian-era corsetry, featured a narrow waist and a padded hip line, evoking the aesthetics of Alexander McQueen's signature style. Furthermore, the gown incorporated sustainable and organic materials, embodying a balanced fusion of history, artistry, and environmental consciousness. In the months following the royal wedding, the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding gown was exhibited at Buckingham Palace, attracting thousands of visitors. The Sarah Burton-designed dress not only crystallized the reputation of Alexander McQueen as a preeminent British fashion house but also highlighted the beauty and elegance of British design and craftsmanship for a global audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - gain weight - wait patiently - stand erect - promise to do - washing dishes The answer to this question is:","completion":"washing dishes When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, the most suitable option to address the issue is washing the dishes. This involves a series of steps to ensure that the dishes are cleaned properly and safely returned to their designated storage spots. Below is a detailed guide on how to go about washing dishes: 1. Gather all the necessary tools: To wash dishes effectively, you will need the following materials: - Dish soap - Sponge or scrubber - Dishcloth or brush - Dish rack or towel (for drying dishes) - Warm water 2. Scrape off leftovers: Before you start washing the dishes, remove any food particles and leftovers from the dishes using a dish scraper or a paper towel. 3. Fill the sink with warm water: Fill one side of your sink with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap to create a soapy solution. If you don't have a double sink, you can use a large basin or tub as an alternative. 4. Soak the dishes: Place the dishes in the soapy water, ensuring that each item is fully submerged. Allow them to soak for a few minutes to loosen up stuck-on food residue. 5. Begin washing: Start washing the least soiled dishes first, such as glasses and cutlery, followed by plates, bowls, and finally, pots and pans. This method helps to prevent cross-contamination and ensures that the dishwashing water stays clean for as long as possible. 6. Scrub the dishes: Use a sponge or scrubber to clean the surface of each dish. Apply enough pressure to remove stubborn food particles, but be mindful not to damage delicate items like glassware or non-stick surfaces. 7. Rinse the dishes: Once a dish is clean, rinse it under running water to remove soap residue. If you're short on water, you can fill another sink or basin with clean water and use it as a rinse station for multiple dishes. 8. Inspect for cleanliness: After rinsing each dish, take a moment to inspect it and ensure that all food particles and soap residue have been removed. If necessary, rewash any items that aren't completely clean. 9. Dry the dishes: Place the clean dishes on a dish rack or a clean towel to air dry. If you prefer, you can also dry the dishes using a clean, lint-free dishcloth. 10. Put away the dishes: Once the dishes are completely dry, safely return them to their designated storage spots in your kitchen. To maintain a clean and organized kitchen, it's always recommended to wash dishes immediately after use or at the very least, establish a routine to ensure that you never have to deal with an unmanageable pile of dirty dishes again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who greatly valued the familial connections of Sissinghurst? from the following article ? Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain. The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials. Now answer this question: What is the typical speed that axons send their electrical signals?","completion":"The typical speed at which axons send their electrical signals, in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, varies depending on the specific neuron.

To do this, you can take a pst.","completion":"A Physical Screening Test, or PST, is a crucial tool in measuring your current capabilities and identifying areas that need improvement before attempting the demanding journey to become a Navy SEAL. The PST evaluates your performance in five key exercises: a 500-yard swim, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and a 1.5-mile run. To pass the minimum standards, you will need to complete the swim in 12 minutes and 30 seconds or less, perform at least 50 push-ups and 50 sit-ups within 2 minutes, achieve a minimum of 10 pull-ups, and finish the 1.5-mile run in 10 minutes and 30 seconds or less. However, it's essential to note that these are merely the minimum requirements, and excelling in these areas will significantly increase your chances of success. Before beginning any training, it is vital to consult with a healthcare professional or a qualified fitness expert to determine your readiness for such a rigorous program. Once you have been cleared to participate in physical training, focus on creating a comprehensive workout plan that targets all aspects of the PST exercises. This could include endurance events like long-distance running and swimming, as well as strength training, calisthenics, and interval workouts. Stretching and flexibility exercises should also be integrated to prevent injury and maintain overall mobility. As you progress through your fitness journey, re-evaluate your PST scores regularly to track your improvement and adjust your training program accordingly. Be prepared to face setbacks and plateaus, but always maintain a determined and resilient mindset. Don't hesitate to seek advice and guidance from qualified coaches and experienced SEALs who can offer invaluable tips and support throughout your training. In addition to your physical fitness, it's crucial to develop the mental toughness and teamwork skills required to succeed as a Navy SEAL. Engage in activities that challenge your mental fortitude, such as marathon running, mountain climbing, or participation in team sports. Embrace situations that require problem-solving, stress management, and the ability to work well with others. Understanding the importance of leadership and the ability to follow is just as essential as physical strength in becoming a Navy SEAL. Finally, fostering a deep understanding of the Navy SEAL ethos and expectations will significantly contribute to your preparedness for the challenges you will face. Research the history and values of the Navy SEALs, learn about the specific missions they undertake, and immerse yourself in the mentality and discipline required to join their ranks.

Article:","completion":"Title: 7 Effective Techniques for Pain Relief Introduction Pain is an inevitable part of life. Whether caused by injuries, illnesses, or chronic conditions, it can be a significant source of discomfort and a major hindrance to our daily activities. With various pain management options available, from over-the-counter medications to holistic therapy, it can be overwhelming to determine the most effective way to alleviate one's suffering. In this article, we will explore seven non-pharmaceutical techniques to help ease pain and discomfort in a holistic and potentially less invasive manner. 1. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises are known to be an effective means of managing pain, as they promote relaxation and increase oxygen levels in the bloodstream. One such exercise is deep breathing, in which you take slow, even breaths that engage your diaphragm rather than shallow breaths from your chest. By doing so, you can send a signal to your brain to release endorphins, which act as natural painkillers. Another technique is box breathing, where you inhale, hold your breath, exhale, and hold your breath again for equal counts. These exercises aim to help divert attention from pain and provide a sense of control over the situation. 2. Visualization Exercises Visualization, or guided imagery, is a technique in which you envision a positive and calming experience or environment. This approach aims to shift your focus from the pain to a more pleasant mental image, helping your body to relax and potentially experience pain relief. To practice this technique, find a quiet, comfortable space, close your eyes, and create a detailed picture in your mind's eye. You can also use an audio-guided visualization to help with this process. 3. Change Positions and Move Around Remaining still for extended periods can lead to increased pain, especially for individuals suffering from chronic pain conditions. By changing positions frequently and moving around, you help to stimulate blood circulation and reduce muscle stiffness. Stretching can also be beneficial in alleviating discomfort by promoting flexibility and muscle relaxation. 4. Get a Massage Massage therapy addresses various types of pain, including muscle aches, tension headaches, and joint pain. By targeting soft tissues and muscle groups connected to the affected area, massage can help improve blood flow, decrease inflammation, and release endorphins for pain relief. It's important to consult with a professional massage therapist to ensure appropriate techniques are used for your specific pain condition. 5. Use Hot or Cold Therapy Both heat and cold therapy can provide relief for different types of pain. Heat therapy is ideal for soothing muscle tension, stiffness, and chronic pain. Applying a heating pad, warm towel, or taking a warm bath can increase blood flow to the area, promoting healing and relaxation. Cold therapy, on the other hand, is effective in reducing inflammation and numbing acute pain from recent injury. Utilize ice packs or cold gel packs to deliver targeted relief to the affected area. 6. Immerse Yourself in a Bath or Take a Shower Similar to heat therapy, taking a warm bath or shower can help alleviate muscle aches, pains, and stiffness. Adding Epsom salts or essential oils, such as lavender, can also contribute to a more relaxing, therapeutic experience. Additionally, hydrotherapy – utilizing water's properties for therapeutic purposes – can aid in relieving pain through buoyancy, providing a weightless environment that relieves pressure on joints and muscles. 7. Try a TENS Unit Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive, drug-free method of pain relief that uses mild electrical currents to interrupt pain signals, stimulating endorphin production. This approach can be particularly helpful for individuals dealing with chronic pain conditions or acute pain from an injury. Consult with a healthcare professional before using a TENS unit to ensure it is appropriate for your specific needs. Conclusion While these techniques can help manage pain, it's essential to recognize that each individual has different needs and experiences with pain. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your particular situation.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Q: Head: PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>Tail: to receive PersonY's letter A:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the given phrases 'Head' and 'Tail' and the relationship between them. Usage: An example is provided in the task description: \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\". Here, 'Head' is \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter\\", and 'Tail' is \\"to receive PersonY's letter\\". The task is about figuring out if the action described in 'Tail' is a likely intention of 'PersonX' based on the 'Head'. It becomes clear that the 'PersonX' answered the letter of 'PersonY' not with the intention of receiving PersonY's letter because the PersonX has already received the letter. Part #2: Replacing the names of specific people with generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). Usage: In \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", 'PersonX' and 'PersonY' are generic replacements for specific people. By avoiding names, we ensure the task focuses on deducing intention from action, not from personal characteristics or relationship dynamics between specific persons. Part #3: Understanding that PersonX is always the subject of the event. Usage: In \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", 'PersonX' is the one performing the action, and thus is the subject. Part #4: Understanding the 'intention' of PersonX based on the 'head' phrase. Usage: The task explanation provides an example of what an intention could be: \\"given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful\\". Part #5: Classifying the answers. Usage: The result of the task must be classified into \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", indicating whether the 'Tail' is likely the intention of the 'PersonX' from the 'Head' phrases or not. For \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", the answer would be \\"No\\", as it's not likely to be the intention. Part #6: Understanding what the placeholder \\"___\\" can represent. Usage: While there is no explicit use of \\"___\\" in the provided example, it might appear in other samples. \\"___\\" could represent a missing part of the sentence that can be an object, a person and/or an action. For example, it could be something like \\"PersonX visits ___\\", where '___' can be replaced with PersonY's house, an action like a 'restaurant', or other nouns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions. Last year, more than £91 billion was spent online and that figure is expected to surpass £100 billion this year. Scroll down for video. More than 25 per cent of British people surveyed in the research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct said they shopped online while in bed (stock image used) According to new research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct, one in four British people now shop online at least once a week. The rising number of people using tablets has also played a part, with one in five of the 1,000 surveyed saying they used their device to shop and one in ten using a smartphone. Such is the enthusiasm for digital shopping, more than 25 per cent said they shop online in bed, while one in 20 said part of their morning commute involves some virtual window shopping. On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions.

This was followed by clothes and accessories with 59.6 per cent, music and entertainment with 55.7 per cent, electronics 54.3 per cent and holiday and travel 50.3 per cent. The rise of online shopping has also been quite rapid, as on average most Brits did not start to use the web for shopping until 2005 and only 12 per cent doing so before the turn of the century. Fiona Ellis Chadwick, senior lecturer in retail management at The Open University Business School, said: 'The early days of online shopping were very basic and the customer experience wasn't fantastic. 'Few Brits had a computer and those that did had very slow internet access, which would take a long time to load an image let alone order a product. 'The customer experience has drastically changed since 1994. British people have increasingly turned away from the high street and bought more items online. This year, online purchases are expected to surpass £100 billion. 'In the early days of online shopping, we would go to the high street and look through various shops and choose from what was on offer.

December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemployment. January 2009: Woolworths shut its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - which saw 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers. January 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography. January 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas. November 2013: Video and DVD chain Blockbuster entered administration.

Article: Accused cop-killer Tremaine Wilbourn surrendered to the U.S. Marshals Monday afternoon, ending an intense two-day manhunt by both local and federal authorities. Accompanied by a lawyer as well as family members, Wilbourn walked into the federal building Downtown a little after 4:30 p.m. Heavily armed U.S. Marshals blocked off part of Front Street outside the federal building during the surrender. Wilbourn, 29, was later taken to 201 Poplar to be interviewed by Memphis Police Department detectives. He is expected to make his first court appearance Tuesday morning and is expected to be charged with first-degree murder. “You have to understand, this has been an exhaustive search, both physically and mentally. This has been an around-the-clock investigation,” Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said. “I think he felt the walls closing in and felt it was in his best interests to turn himself in.” Added Mayor AC Wharton: “(Police) worked around the clock to keep the pressure on, to let the suspect know there was no hiding place, that we were not going to relent in any way, making it an imperative that he did what he needed to do.” Wilbourn is accused of shooting Officer Sean Bolton Saturday night in the 4800 block of Summerland Avenue in Parkway Village. Bolton, who would’ve turned 34 this week, pulled in front of a red 2002 Mercedes-Benz that was stopped on the side of the street, police have said. Bolton got out of his squad car and approached that car, police said, but the passenger got out and a struggle ensued. Police say that Wilbourn pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots into Bolton at close range. Police later found drug paraphernalia as well as 1.7 grams of marijuana in the Mercedes. A man who lives in the neighborhood picked up Bolton’s police radio and called dispatchers for help. Bolton was rushed to the Regional Medical Center in critical condition but did not survive. “I think you have an individual who went above and beyond to demonstrate that he’s a violent individual,” Armstrong said. “He committed a bank robbery and I think he’d committed a robbery prior to that. All the signs were there.” Armstrong said he went to homicide to talk to Wilbourn after he was brought in. “I asked him that, ‘Are you okay? Is everything okay?’ And he said yes,” Armstrong said. “He wanted to make it a point to say, ... “I want you to know that I am not a cold-blooded killer and I am not a coward,” Armstrong added. “If you remember, I called him a coward in a press conference and that did not sit too well with him.” A reward of up to 50,000 was raised for Wilbourn’s arrest, but it’s unclear what will become of that now. Wharton said there were legal issues to be sorted out. Wilbourn was on supervised release after a conviction for robbing the Friendship Bank in Covington in 2005. On June 15 of that year, Wilbourn and his uncle, Adam Mackey, then 34, hit the bank and netted 2,000. At the time of the arrest, police said the pair dropped more than 7,500 as they tried to flee the scene. Wilbourn, who was 19 at the time, was sentenced to 10 years and one month in jail. The duo was ordered to repay the 2,000, plus 200 in court fees, which they did in March, according to their plea agreement. Wilbourn was released from prison on July 1, 2014, after serving nine years. He was placed on probation for the robbery for three years. Armstrong said he met with Bolton’s family Sunday, then called them Monday to tell them of the arrest. “As you can imagine, they were relieved,” he said. “Certainly this is part of the healing process. It’s a long process, not only for the Bolton family but for the MPD family as well. This is just ones step in the healing process.” Staff reporter Yolanda Jones contributed to this story. ||||| To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Spending a lot of time watching TV, playing video games and surfing the Web causes a lot of healthy problems to children such as overweight and smoking, US researchers said yesterday. U.S. experts analyzed 173 studies on how media sources influence the physical health of children and adolescents . The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health. The studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \\"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\\" said one of the researchers in the report. For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside. One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens. A US study published in November showed that adolescents who watched more programs with sexual themes had a higher risk of becoming pregnant or causing a pregnancy. Thirteen of 14 studies that evaluated sexual behavior found a connection between media exposure and earlier sexual behavior, the researchers said.

The use of a comma and \\"and\\" implies that these are two separate clauses that could stand alone as sentences but are connected by the \\"and\\" to paint a cohesive picture of the overall narrative. In Sentence 2: \\"The Gill family sold the mill in 1968 and was closed by the new owners in 1980.\\" This sentence is structured to convey the same events as in sentence 1 but with a slightly different phrasing. The sale of the mill by the Gill family in 1968 is mentioned at the beginning of the sentence just like in sentence 1. However, the second part of the sentence is written in passive voice, \\"was closed by the new owners in 1980,\\" as opposed to the active voice used in sentence 1. Furthermore, the sentence omits the comma before \\"and,\\" making it a compound predicate instead of two separate clauses. Although the phrasing and sentence structure differ, both sentences effectively communicate that the Gill family sold the mill in 1968, and the new owners closed it in 1980. While the first sentence distinctly separates the two events with a coordinating conjunction and a comma, the second sentence combines both events into one smooth narrative. In this sense, the information conveyed is the same, but the execution varies slightly in terms of grammar and sentence construction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

George Pataki has sent word that it's time to go back to the drawing board. It is the right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far. The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown. While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed. Pataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that any plan for the site replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. More than anything else, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago. Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary. The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown. Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region. Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. But it would be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill. Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Expense\\" correctly answer the question \\"What is the issue in building a park on the world trade center site\\"?

Which continent used fewer bromine gasses? Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Small continent used fewer bromine gases. The paragraph explains that Big continent used more air polluting substances and, as a result, got a hole in its ozone layer. Small continent, on the other hand, was very protective towards the environment, which indicates that they were more conscious of their actions and likely to have used fewer harmful substances, including bromine gases. Chlorine and bromine gases are identified as the chief culprits in destroying the ozone layer. These gases are found in aerosol sprays, coolants, and various other products that contribute to air pollution. Ozone depletion leads to a rise in UV radiation reaching Earth, and this has dire consequences on humans, such as increased skin cancers and eye cataracts, as well as disturbing the nitrogen cycle, killing plankton, and disrupting ocean food webs. These harmful effects emphasize the significance of protecting the ozone layer. The rate of loss of the ozone layer has slowed down due to restrictions placed on pollutants.

Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned HÃ´tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia. As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent. The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Mokoena) for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the General with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Soon after, the family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel...

Charlton is related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were Jack Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City), George Milburn (Leeds United and Chesterfield), Jim Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City) and Stan Milburn (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer Jackie Milburn, was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie. His elder brother, Jack, initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United. His other brother, Tommy, plays walking football for the Mature Millers club in Rotherham. He played in qualifiers for the 1962 World Cup in Chile against Luxembourg and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3-1 group win over Argentina was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by Brazil, who went on to win the tournament. By now, England were coached by Alf Ramsey who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the committee-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection - it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form. Luckily for Charlton, he had all three. A hat-trick in the 8-1 rout of Switzerland in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the record jointly held by Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse and Charlton's 31st goal against Wales in October the same year gave him the record alone. Charlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the 1966 World Cup around him. When England beat the USA 10-0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England. His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed Jimmy Greaves, playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.

Seeking More Ways to Distribute Aid in Syria UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations is under pressure to ratchet up aid to nongovernmental organizations that can operate in the vast sections of Syria under opposition control, as most of the humanitarian relief sponsored by the organization ends up in the western slice of the country held by President Bashar al-Assad. More than 85 percent of food aid and more than 70 percent of medicines went to government-held areas in the first three months of this year, compared with roughly 50-50 a year ago, because of intensified conflict on the ground, according to the United Nations. That stark inequity, which Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due to reveal publicly next week in his monthly assessment to the Security Council, is likely to inflame the sentiments of Western and Arab donors who are already leaning on United Nations agencies to divert aid from the government to zones under the control of Mr. Assad’s opponents. That, senior United Nations officials say, is easier said than done. Trucking in aid from Turkey without the government’s consent would risk expulsion from the country and in turn losing the ability to deliver relief to more than four million people who live in government-held areas. John Ging, who manages field operations worldwide for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the agencies had been told by the government that they would be kicked out of government-held parts of the country if they crossed borders without the state’s consent. “The calculation of what to do in the face of such threats and obstruction is very complex; history will judge as to whether we got it right or wrong,” Mr. Ging said. “In the meantime, we will never accept being blocked from saving lives and have appealed to the Security Council for help.” Cross-border aid is a tricky matter for the United Nations agencies because of a raging debate inside the world body about whether the law allows them to enter Syrian territory without the state’s permission. But just trucking in aid from the long northern border with Turkey wouldn’t solve the problem. Some two million Syrians are deep inside the country — and getting food and medicines to them means crossing front lines and then checkpoints manned by numerous armed opposition groups. So far, a little more than a half-dozen rebel groups, including the Free Syrian Army, have agreed to let United Nations aid convoys come through their areas, though none of the extremist groups affiliated with Al Qaeda, which now dominate several key areas and roads. “Their reason is it’s not secure. Our response to that is we will take the risks,” Mr. Ging said. “We are making a careful calculation every day on what’s the best thing to do in the face of impossible circumstances.” The debates within the world body come nearly three months after the Security Council passed a legally binding resolution urging the warring parties to allow shipments of food and medicines. Since then, the United Nations humanitarian agencies have chronicled the ways in which the resolution has been repeatedly flouted. Mr. Ging’s boss, Valerie Amos, the emergency relief envoy, has urged the Council to take further steps. The Council has found itself deadlocked. Its original resolution has no enforcement provision, but it threatens to take “further steps” in the event of noncompliance. Now, Australia, Jordan and Luxembourg are drafting a new resolution that would seek to strengthen the original measure, possibly under Chapter VII of the organization’s charter, which authorizes force to back the Council’s demands. Its chances of passage are unknown. Russia has long been loathe to agree to any enforcement language — and is likely to veto a measure with any force. Separately, Britain announced last week that it would dole out a greater share of aid to nongovernmental organizations that can operate in opposition-held areas without consent of the Assad government. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday hinted Washington was considering increasing support to aid groups that can operate in rebel-held territory. United Nations officials said they were vetting smaller aid agencies that can operate in different parts of the country and were seeking to escalate donor funding so they can get relief into hard-to-reach areas. Aid groups are looking to the world body for more help in coordinating their activities, including negotiating safe passage with a variety of armed groups that set up checkpoints along the roads. Mercy Corps, which worked in several parts of Syria, was recently prohibited from operating in Damascus. Five staff members of Médicins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, were released this week after being abducted in northern Syria by an armed group that the aid organization refused to name.

The article states that more than 85% of food aid and over 70% of medicines went to government-held areas in the first three months of the year this article was written, compared to a roughly 50-50 split a year earlier.

Providing aid from Turkey without government consent could lead to expulsion from the country and the loss of the ability to deliver relief to over four million people living in government-held areas. Furthermore, crossing borders without the state's permission raises legal issues within the U.N. itself.

The article also highlights that the Security Council faces deadlock on the issue, with some countries advocating for stronger measures to enforce aid distribution, and others, like Russia, opposing the use of force. The U.N. is exploring other ways to distribute aid within Syria, such as vetting smaller aid agencies that can operate in different parts of the country and seeking to increase donor funding to enable relief in hard-to-reach areas.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines. He selected two locations. One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D. But I can use this background: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. What is an answer for this question: Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C? The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, \\"Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C?\\", let's examine the given information step-by-step: 1.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Don't Worry, Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'Fans of the completely terrible \\"Shrek\\" might enjoy, but \\"Wallace & Gromit\\" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I won't point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy's hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it. Too many, for want of a better word, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else!

Can we infer the following? Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden, also known as Robin Hobb, is an American Aquarius writer.

From this information, when referring to astrology, she would fall under the zodiac sign Pisces, not Aquarius. The astrological sign Pisces typically covers those born between February 18 and March 20. This would contradict the statement claiming she is an Aquarius, as the Aquarius sign covers those born between January 20 and February 18. In astrology, the precise dates of the signs can vary slightly year to year due to the leap year. However, with her birth date clearly falling in March, there is no variation that would place her as belonging to the star sign Aquarius.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: A. for a few hours B. for a few minutes C. not enough information D. for a few days === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"B. for a few minutes Mud masks or facial masks should typically be applied for a few minutes, usually between 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the specific product and instructions. These masks are designed to draw out impurities, add moisture, and provide essential nutrients to the skin in a relatively short period of time. It is important to follow the guidelines provided with each product to ensure proper usage and to achieve the desired results in repairing sun-damaged skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of...","completion":"The full name of the person who pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan is the Fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso. Lozang Gyatso, also known as Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, was a key figure in the establishment of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism and the political unification of Tibet under the rule of the Dalai Lamas. Born in 1617, he became the leader of the Gelugpas at a time when the Gelug school faced threats from rival Tibetan Buddhist schools and political factions. As the context describes, when an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened the Gelugpas with destruction, Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from Güshi Khan, who was the leader of the Khoshut tribe of the Oirat Mongols. Güshi Khan was a prominent figure in the 17th century, leading his tribe in various military expeditions and ultimately helping the Gelugpas establish political control over Tibet. Between 1637 and 1640, Güshi Khan defeated the enemies of the Gelugpas in the Amdo and Kham regions, effectively eliminating threats to the Gelug school and solidifying its influence. At the urging of the Gelugpa regent Sonam Chöpel, Güshi Khan attacked the Ü-Tsang king's stronghold in Shigatse, successfully capturing it after a year-long siege in 1642. This event led to the execution of Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang and King of Tibet. Following the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan presented his conquest as a gift to Lozang Gyatso, the Fifth Dalai Lama, in a ceremonious event. As a result, Lozang Gyatso was enthroned as the ruler of Tibet, with Sonam Chöpel serving as the regent and holding actual governing authority. Despite being granted the title of 'King of Tibet,' Güshi Khan maintained control over the military forces and accepted a subordinate role to the Dalai Lama, displaying the strengthened collaboration between the two. The shared rule between Lozang Gyatso, Sonam Chöpel, and Güshi Khan led to the early development of both secular and religious governance in Tibet under the authority of the Dalai Lamas. Lozang Gyatso, as the Fifth Dalai Lama, expanded his authority by emphasizing lineage reincarnation, performing religious rituals, and constructing significant religious sites, such as the Potala Palace. This established the strong foundations for the political and religious institution of the Dalai Lama that persists in Tibetan Buddhism to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who dispensed justice in the New Kingdom for both civil and criminal cases?? ? The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.

Article:","completion":"Title: Effective Tips for Writing Engaging and Informative Articles Writing an article may seem like a challenging endeavor, particularly when you want your audience to engage and take something memorable away from your piece. However, by following a set of guidelines, this can be a rewarding task. This article seeks to provide insight into how to choose a topic, decide on a call to action, answer the question, consider the length, give examples, contemplate all the question words, and avoid generalizations. The first step is selecting a topic you're knowledgeable about. The importance of this step reflects in your ability to convey your thoughts and information with authority and confidence. By choosing a subject you're well-versed in, you can ensure that you communicate your ideas effectively, thus, making your article more engaging and credible. Subsequently, deciding on a call to action is critical. Your call to action is the response you want your readers to have after they've finished reading your piece. This could vary from merely sparking a discussion on the topic to triggering a change in behavior or mindset. Your article should design to motivate your readers to respond to your call to action. After deciding on a call to action, it's crucial to answer the question. Every article should aim to resolve a problem, answer a question, or fill an information gap. By answering the question, your article becomes a valuable resource, providing information that your readers may find useful or enlightening. Next, consider the length of your article. While there may not be a set standard for article length, it’s vital to ensure your piece is long enough to cover the topic in depth but not so extensive that it bores the reader. Be Concise, but make sure to cover all necessary points to give your readers a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Incorporating examples into your article can greatly enhance its clarity and depth. Providing examples to back your points or express your ideas helps the readers visualize and better understand your concept. These real-world illustrations reinforce your arguments and provide tangible evidence to back up your ideas. Additionally, take into account all the interrogative words – who, what, when, where, why, and how, as they can help structure your article and ensure exhaustive coverage. Every question word addresses a unique aspect – perhaps the circumstance (when), or the reasons (why), or the procedures (how). Including these aspects in your article ensures a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Lastly, it’s essential to avoid generalizations. While they might seem like a shortcut to cover more information, generalizations can lead to misinformation or oversimplification of complex topics. Always strive for accuracy and specificity in your writing to provide the most reliable and comprehensive information to your readers. In conclusion, article writing is a multi-faceted task that requires careful thought and planning. By choosing a knowledgeable topic, deciding on a call to action, answering the question, considering the length, providing examples, incorporating all question words, and avoiding generalizations, you can write a more engaging and informative article. Each step in the process serves to enhance the richness, reliability, and relevance of your article, thereby making it a valuable resource for your readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although there have been hundreds of other books declaring to offer a quick look behind the Palace doors, this is the first written by someone who is closely related to the Royal Family and has shared their lives--not only throughout the Queen's reign but also through that of her father, King George VI. The Final Curtsey was written by her Majesty's cousin and childhood playmate the Honorable Margaret Rhodes. It tells in details the story of Mrs. Rhodes's relationship with the Royal family over eight decades. The book, with delightfully informal and never-before-seen pictures, has been written with the full knowledge of the Queen, who has read and approved parts of it. Born in 1925, the Honorable Margaret Rhodes has led an extraordinary life. She was the childhood playmate of her cousin, the Queen; a wartime M16 spy; and she was a lady-in- waiting to her aunt, the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, from 1991 until the latter's death in 2002.

Summarize this article: Traumatized Woman Finds Face in Car Wash BOZEMAN, Mont. (CN) - A woman who found a man's face on the floor of a car wash blames a trucking company for it, claiming its driver ran over a man and left him dead on the road, whereupon another driver ran him over again, then washed his face off her car. Kimberly Kriege sued CRST Expedited on Monday in Gallatin County Court. Aside from defendants John Does I-III, they are the only parties to the lawsuit. Kriege, a veterinarian, says she drove her truck to the Super Car Wash in Livingston on Sept. 30, 2013, and found a human face on the floor of the wash bay. She immediately called police, who \\"treated [her] as a criminal suspect,\\" impounded her truck, demanded a blood sample and held her for several hours, she says in the complaint. The face belonged to 81-year old Elgie Bedford, of Alaska, who had been en route from Wasilla to Paris, Texas to visit his children and grandchildren. Bedford, whose car had gone off the road, was walking along Interstate 90 near Big Timber on Sept. 30 when he was struck by a CRST truck driven by David Welk, according to the lawsuit and media reports. \\"Welk turned his semi-truck around and drove to the impact location, where he used a flashlight to observe objects lying on the highway,\\" Kriege says in the complaint. \\"Welk told his co-worker that he saw clothing and a duffle bag when he actually saw Bedford's body.\\" Kriege said Welk was obligated to call law enforcement to report the accident, but just \\"left the body on the highway, knowing that someone could be held responsible for the hit and run death.\\" Investigators believe Bedford's body had been struck by multiple vehicles before Montana Highway Patrol officers discovered it at about 7:30 a.m. One driver who ran over the body was 31-year-old Wryan Young, who drove to the car wash in Livingston, where she cleaned her Ford pickup and \\"left a large portion of Bedford's face on the car wash floor,\\" Kriege says in the complaint. Kriege, says that finding \\"a large recognizable part of a human face\\" traumatized her severely, necessitating \\"intensive psychological counseling.\\" Welk, 45, of Marion, Ind., was arrested in Iowa on Jan. 23, 2014 after his co-driver called to report they had hit something. He was convicted in Sweet Grass County District Court in Big Timber the following October. District Judge Katherine Bidegaray sentenced him on Jan. 6, 2015 to a 6-year deferred sentence for leaving the scene of the accident, giving him credit for the 348 days he spent in jail. Prosecutors unsuccessfully sought a 2-year jail sentence, according to The Associated Press. Young, from Oak Harbor, Wash., was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and tampering with evidence. Her father, Westley Young, 50, who had been traveling with his daughter when she hit Bedford's body, was charged with tampering with evidence. At the time, both faced up to 10 years in prison and a 50,000 fine each. Prosecutors in Sweet Grass and Park counties dismissed the charges against Wryan Young in late 2014, according to the Whidbey News-Times. She testified in Welk's trial in October 2014 and said she believed she had run over a piece of tan cloth, according to the News-Times. Courthouse News was unable to ascertain the outcome of her father's case. Kriege's attorney, Michael Sand in Bozeman, did not return a phone call Wednesday.

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny?

A Family Ski Trip Takes a Fateful Turn It was during an exciting family skiing trip to Valmorel, France, that Pickford's life changed for the better. While enjoying time on the slopes, Yvonne's daughter, Jenii, made a speedy descent on a sledge and crashed into her mother. As Yvonne examined herself for bruises, she made a startling discovery - lumps in her breasts. Little did she know that this accident would lead her to become a valuable advocate for cancer research and raise thousands for the cause. Diagnosis and Swift Action As soon as they returned from the ski trip, Yvonne visited her GP, who confirmed her worst fears. The lump on her right breast was malignant and spreading rapidly. Without wasting any time, Yvonne underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Despite the physical and emotional hardships that cancer treatment entails, she remained determined to fight the aggressive disease. As a result of her self-discovery and swift action, she overcame her battle with breast cancer. Yvonne Raises Thousands for Cancer Research UK In the wake of her life-altering experience, Yvonne transformed herself into a woman on a mission. Having won the battle against breast cancer, she found purpose in raising funds and awareness for Cancer Research UK. To date, Yvonne has managed to raise an impressive sum of more than £15,000, truly putting her passion for the cause to work.

I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling, \\"Stop dialing\\" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies.

This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict (Goldsmith and Sheptycki, 2007) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions (Hills, 2009). Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What kind of countries get assistance with policing?","completion":"Countries that typically receive assistance with policing are those that can be described as weak, failed or failing, or those that are recovering from conflict or have recently undergone significant political, socio-economic, or environmental changes. These states often face considerable challenges in terms of maintaining public order, ensuring the rule of law, and safeguarding the safety and security of their citizens. In such situations, the international community, through organizations such as the United Nations, regional organizations, or individual donor countries, may step in to provide police development aid and support. Assistance with policing is provided to countries that demonstrate the following characteristics: 1. Weak institutional capacity: These countries often have inadequate or dysfunctional law enforcement and security institutions. The police forces may lack the necessary skills, knowledge, equipment, and resources to effectively carry out their mandate, leading to poor performance and an inability to tackle crime and maintain public order. 2. High levels of crime and insecurity: Countries with high levels of crime, violence, and social unrest often require external support to strengthen their policing systems and build the institutional capacity needed to confront these challenges. Organized crime, terrorism, and other forms of transnational crime may be particularly acute in these states, further exacerbating the security situation. 3. Post-conflict or fragile states: Countries recovering from conflict or civil war typically face numerous challenges related to policing and public security. State institutions, including police forces, may have been severely weakened or even dismantled during the conflict, resulting in a lack of trained personnel and resources to maintain order and protect citizens. These states may also struggle with issues such as disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants and rebuilding trust between the police and the local population. 4. States undergoing political or economic transition: In countries experiencing significant political or economic changes, such as transitioning from autocratic to democratic systems, the existing police and security apparatus may be ill-suited to a new political environment and require substantial reform. Development aid and technical assistance may be useful in helping these countries modernize their policing systems and adapt them to be more efficient, transparent, and accountable. Transnational police development aid aims to address these challenges by enhancing the capacity of recipient countries' law enforcement and security institutions. This can include activities such as training programs, the provision of equipment and infrastructure, and the development of policy and regulatory frameworks. It is essential to recognize that the transfer of policing models and practices between jurisdictions should be done with caution, as the unique socio-political and cultural contexts of each country must be taken into consideration. Donors need to be sensitive to these factors and work collaboratively with recipient countries to ensure that the assistance provided is culturally appropriate, effective, and sustainable in the long term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The difficulty they are experiencing in completing the last rep on both days 2 and 3 of week 3 suggests that their physical endurance is being challenged. This challenge could stem from not having enough energy to perform at the required level. It is important to consider factors that might be affecting their energy levels, as well as ways to address this issue. Some possible reasons for their lack of energy could be an inadequate diet, insufficient sleep, overtraining, or even potential underlying health issues. To overcome the \\"wall\\" they have encountered, they might need to reevaluate and modify their current lifestyle habits, such as incorporating a well-balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and allowing for adequate recovery between workouts. Additionally, it is crucial for them not to feel discouraged by their current struggle, as recognising their limitations and being willing to adapt their training schedule reflects a healthy approach to their fitness journey. By repeating week 3, they are giving themselves the opportunity to build greater endurance and resilience gradually, rather than expecting immediate results and risking potential injury from overexertion. In conclusion, the reason they have hit a wall appears to be a lack of energy, which could be a consequence of various factors like inadequate diet, sleep, or recovery time. Addressing these issues and remaining flexible in adjusting their training plan will likely help them overcome the current hurdle and progress towards their goal of increasing their physical capacity and endurance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In cookery Sauce Mousseline, Sauce Dijon & Sauce Foyot are all derivatives of which ‘mother’ sauce????","completion":"Sauce Mousseline, Sauce Dijon, and Sauce Foyot are all derivatives of the \\"mother\\" sauce called Sauce Hollandaise. Sauce Hollandaise is one of the five fundamental \\"mother\\" sauces in French cuisine as defined by Auguste Escoffier in his classic culinary guide, \\"Le Guide Culinaire\\". These mother sauces are the base for many various sauces used in French cookery. Sauce Hollandaise is an emulsion of egg yolks, melted butter, and lemon juice or vinegar, typically seasoned with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper. It is a rich and creamy sauce with a pale yellow color and is often served over eggs Benedict, fish dishes, and steamed vegetables like asparagus. 1. Sauce Mousseline: Also known as Sauce Chantilly, this sauce is a variation of Sauce Hollandaise, with one additional ingredient – whipped cream. To make Sauce Mousseline, prepare a classic Hollandaise sauce and gently fold in whipped cream at the end. The resulting sauce is lighter, airier, and has a delicate texture compared to the original. It is typically served with fish, seafood, and even some poultry dishes or vegetables like asparagus and artichokes. 2. Sauce Dijon: As the name suggests, this sauce is made by adding Dijon mustard to the base Hollandaise sauce. In a traditional recipe, Sauce Dijon contains about 2-3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard per cup of Hollandaise sauce. The Dijon mustard adds a tangy and slightly spicy flavor, making it an excellent accompaniment for fish, like grilled or poached salmon, as well as for vegetables and certain meat dishes. 3. Sauce Foyot: Also known as Sauce Valois or Sauce Béarnaise au Beurre, this sauce is a combination of Sauce Hollandaise and Sauce Béarnaise, which itself is a derivative of hollandaise. To make Sauce Foyot, add a generous amount of reduced meat glaze (called \\"glaçage\\" in French) or veal demi-glace to a classic Sauce Béarnaise. The meat glaze gives this sauce a slightly more intense flavor and a richer texture, making it suitable for more robust dishes, like grilled or roasted meats, particularly steak and lamb. So, in summary, Sauce Mousseline, Sauce Dijon, and Sauce Foyot are all derivatives of the mother sauce, Sauce Hollandaise. Each of these sauces has its own unique taste and texture, making them versatile additions to a range of dishes in French cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: Chester Gould created which comic character, which first appeared in 1931?","completion":"Chester Gould created the iconic comic character Dick Tracy, which first appeared on October 4th, 1931. Dick Tracy is a long-running American comic strip featuring a hard-hitting, intelligent, and highly skilled detective. The character made its debut in the Detroit Mirror newspaper and was later syndicated by the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. The strip achieved massive popularity and was eventually picked up by more than 650 newspapers across the United States. Dick Tracy is known for his unwavering dedication to upholding the law and his relentless pursuit of the most dangerous criminals in his city. The comic strip revolves around Tracy's crime-solving adventures, which often feature a diverse cast of grotesque and morally corrupt villains. Eventually, the character's fame spread beyond the newspapers, and Dick Tracy was adapted into various other media, including radio shows, movies, and television series. One of the unique aspects of the Dick Tracy series is its use of cutting-edge technology, both in the context of the character's crime-solving methods and the inventions created by Chester Gould. Dick Tracy famously sported a two-way wrist radio, which later evolved into a two-way wrist TV, and eventually became a wrist computer. This gadget allowed him to communicate with colleagues and receive important information quickly. Gould's vision of futuristic technology in his comic inspired some real-world gadget innovations, such as smartwatches and handheld computers. Throughout the years, numerous comic artists and writers have taken over the task of creating Dick Tracy stories. Nevertheless, the character remains a classic and beloved detective figure, often cited as a significant influence on the creation of other crime-fighting heroes in popular culture. As an early pioneer of the detective genre in comics, Chester Gould's Dick Tracy has earned a place among the pantheon of renowned comic characters and continues to endure as a symbol of justice and ingenuity in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Economic; The importance of trade and economic interests to the participants is often under estimated; contemporaries viewed Dutch and English support for the Habsburg cause as primarily driven by a desire for access to the Spanish American markets. Modern economics generally assumes a constantly growing market whereas the then dominant theory of Mercantilism viewed it as static. As a result, increasing your share of trade implied taking it from someone else, with the government's role being to restrict foreign competition. Trade was often used as a policy weapon; between 1690-1704, English import duties increased by 400%, while the 1651-1663 Navigation Acts were a major factor in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. On 6 September 1700, France banned the import of English manufactured goods like cloth and imposed prohibitive duties on a wide range of others. Military; the armies engaged in the Nine Years War often exceeded 100,000 men and proved too large for the pre-industrial economies of its participants. Those of 1701-1714 averaged around 35,000 - 50,000 but a dependence on water-borne transport accentuated the importance of rivers like the Rhine in Germany or the Adda in Northern Italy.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rex Tillerson arrives at the Atlantic Council policy forum to discuss North Korea The US is \\"ready to talk any time\\" with North Korea without preconditions, says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. His statement appeared to shift the US position away from previous demands that North Korea must disarm before any talks can be held. But hours later the White House said President Donald Trump's views on North Korea \\"had not changed\\". North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons technology has led to heavy US-led sanctions against the regime. Separately, the UN's political chief Jeffrey Feltman, who recently visited Pyongyang, told reporters that North Korean officials felt it was \\"important to prevent war\\". China and Russia both welcomed Mr Tillerson's comments. The Chinese foreign ministry hoped there would now be \\"meaningful steps towards dialogue and contact\\" between the US and the North. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said: \\"Such constructive statements impress us far more than the confrontational rhetoric that we have heard up to now.\\" Diplomatic relations between the US and North Korea have been strained by recent North Korean nuclear and missile tests, and by a war of words between Mr Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Speaking at the Atlantic Council policy forum on Tuesday, Mr Tillerson said the US \\"simply cannot accept a nuclear armed North Korea\\". Appearing to soften the US stance towards potential future talks, he said: \\"Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. \\"Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How could war with North Korea unfold? But he insisted that there needed to be a \\"period of quiet\\" first, without any nuclear or missile tests. He added that economic and diplomatic sanctions would continue until \\"the first bomb drops\\", and Mr Trump still wanted China - Pyongyang's main economic ally - to cut off oil supplies to North Korea. Mr Tillerson also said China had made contingency plans to accommodate North Korean refugees in the event of a conflict, a major concern for China. Several hours after his comments, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views \\"have not changed\\". \\"North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.\\" On Wednesday, North Korean state media said Kim Jong-un had vowed his country would become \\"the strongest nuclear power and military power in the world\\". Speaking at a munitions industry conference, he cited North Korea's recent launch of intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-15 as a \\"great historic victory\\". 'Left the door ajar' The UN's Jeffrey Feltman said that while senior North Korean officials did not offer any commitments, they had agreed that discussions should continue. \\"They agreed that it was important to prevent war,\\" he said, in his first briefing since his four-day trip last week. \\"We've left the door ajar and I fervently hope the door to a negotiated solution will now be opened wide.\\" ||||| Tillerson Wants To Start Talks With North Korea With No Conditions Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP Updated at 7:55 p.m. ET Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday the U.S. would be willing to enter negotiations with North Korea without requiring that it agree beforehand to give up its nuclear weapons program. The willingness to engage in talks without that understanding is a significant change in the U.S. approach. \\"It's not realistic to say we are only going to talk if you come to the table ready to give up your program,\\" Tillerson said in an address to the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. \\"They have too much invested in it, and [President Trump] is very realistic about that as well.\\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later released a statement saying, \\"The President's views on North Korea have not changed. North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.\\" Tillerson said the U.S. is ready to talk whenever North Korea is. \\"We are ready to have the first meeting without precondition. Let's just meet. We can talk about the weather if you want. We can talk about whether it's going to be a square table if that's what you are excited about,\\" Tillerson said. \\"It's really about how do you begin the process of engagement. Because we are dealing with a North Korean leader that no one has ever engaged with. He's clearly not like his father,\\" said Tillerson. \\"And we don't know what it will be like to engage with him.\\" It will also be tough to talk, Tillerson says, if North Korea continues to fire off missiles or test nuclear devices. The idea of talks about talks is something Suzanne Dimaggio supports. A senior fellow at a think tank called New America, Dimaggio has been part of so-called track two diplomacy with North Korea and says the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals with the president once tweeting that Tillerson is wasting his time. \\"Clearly there's a need for this adminsitration to speak with one voice and stop this contradictory signaling,\\" she says. \\"It is high time to move from a dithering approach and have a real strategy and empower our diplomats to carry that strategy out.\\" Tillerson plans to go later this week to the United Nations for a high-level Security Council meeting on North Korea. A top U.N. diplomat and former State Department official, Jeffrey Feltman, is just back from Pyongyang, and the U.N. says he is calling for open channels to reduce the risks of conflict. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that the US is ready to hold talks with North Korea without preconditions, a statement that appears to mark a shift in the country's stance.

With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. In August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\" McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today. In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions. McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than 10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than 11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was she sick prior to being diagnosed with cancer?","completion":"Yes, Hattie McDaniel was sick before being diagnosed with cancer. In August 1950, she suffered a heart ailment and entered the hospital in a semi-critical condition.

Prince Harry proved just how serious he is about Suits actress Meghan Markle after making a top-secret visit to her home in Toronto, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal. With just one protection officer in tow, the 32-year-old royal kept a low profile as he caught a commercial flight to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport on October 28 for a romantic trip to the Canadian city. “He was buzzing with excitement when he arrived,” a Harry pal tells the new issue of Us Weekly, adding that a “car was waiting at the airport so he could be driven to Meghan’s house.” For the next several days, including Halloween night, the couple holed up inside 35-year-old Markle’s suburban pad, forgoing nights out at her favorite city spots in favor of cooking together at home and playing with her rescue dogs, Lab-shepherd mix Bogart and beagle Guy. Adds the pal, “It’s very serious.” For the couple — who met through a mutual friend in June — the visit has been one of many transatlantic travels in their relationship. Markle quietly went on dates with Harry on trips to London in July, September and October, often sharing cryptic snaps of her British travels on Instagram. “She’s met his closest circle of friends, and they all love her,” a source adds of the U.N. Women advocate, who has spent time with a number of his nearest and dearest, including a double date with Harry’s cousin Princess Eugenie and her love Jack Brooksbank. “It’s an exciting time.” And while it’s too early for engagement talk, the source adds that Markle is perfect for the philanthropic prince: “Harry’s in a really good place. Being able to find his true purpose through his work and now being able to share it with someone else. Everyone is so happy for him.” For more about the Prince’s blossoming relationship — including how he broke the news to Kensington Palace aides — pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!

As is the way with these things, Ms Markle - best known for her role in the legal drama, Suits - combines her acting career with being a UN advocate and style blogger, boasting a million followers on Instagram, where she describes herself as a “lover of handwritten notes”. Breathless reports declare that the two have been an item for six months, share a love of yoga, and sport matching friendship bracelets. The 32-year-old prince is described as “besotted”. One detail that no one seems unduly concerned about is that Markle is a divorcee, following a marriage to a film producer that ended in 2014. “And why should they be?” those of a more nipperish persuasion may demand. Yet to anyone hoary enough to remember the sacrifice made in the Fifties by Princess Margaret, the nonchalance about such matters will represent a significant sea change. ||||| Prince Harry is so serious with actress Meghan Markle that an engagement could be in the not-so-distant future, insiders suggest.

It’s pretty serious, so we will see.” The prince, 32, and the Suits star, 35, have been dating seriously for about two months, another source confirms. Things are moving so quickly, in fact, that Harry has already introduced Markle to his father (and the future king of England), Prince Charles, PEOPLE has learned. “Harry is pretty serious about her and she is pretty serious about him,” says the pal. Adds a close friend: “It’s great. They have a lot in common and I’m sure they will get on very well.” Markle, a Northwestern University grad and the founder of the “inspired lifestyle” site The Tig, has intriguingly posted as series of Instagram clues in recent months—including a cheeky photo on Tuesday of two cuddling bananas.

The shift is part of a rough-draft report coming out of a two-week synod aimed at familial issues, reports the New York Times, and the bishops gathered are advising that the Church do things like find \\"positive aspects of civil unions and cohabitation\\" and embrace \\"those who participate in (the Church's) life in an incomplete and imperfect way, appreciating the positive values they contain rather than their limitations and shortcoming.\\" While a Church official emphasizes that the report is \\"a work in progress,\\" NPR notes that Pope Francis stirred \\"heated debate\\" on the issue of divorced Catholics earlier this year, and asked a moderate cardinal to address his peers. \\"And many people say this is not the God of Jesus, because Jesus was very merciful—he forgives us—and the church does not,\\" says German Cardinal Walter Kasper. When the pope himself was asked last year about it, he replied, \\"I believe that this is the season of mercy.\\" A complete report is due next week, and while the Times notes that it's unlikely to toss doctrine on its head, this change in tone will reverberate in parishes globally. Expand this summary.","completion":"The Vatican, under the leadership of Pope Francis, seems to be moving towards a more inclusive stance regarding gay and divorced Catholics, encouraging priests to make \\"courageous pastoral choices\\" that embrace diverse family models. This apparent shift in attitude is part of a preliminary report emerging from a two-week synod that focuses on familial issues. Bishops attending the synod have suggested that the Church should recognize the \\"positive aspects of civil unions and cohabitation\\" and welcome individuals who participate in the Church's life in an \\"incomplete and imperfect way\\", acknowledging the values they bring rather than focusing on their limitations. While the report is still a work in progress, it reflects a growing change in tone and approach within the Catholic Church, primarily driven by Pope Francis himself. Earlier this year, the pope initiated a heated debate about the Church's treatment of divorced Catholics, and he asked a moderate cardinal to address his fellow clergy members on the issue. German Cardinal Walter Kasper remarked that many people argue that the current stance of the Church doesn't align with the teachings of Jesus, who was known for his mercy and forgiveness. Pope Francis' vision of a more merciful and inclusive Church was evident when he was asked about the issue of divorced Catholics last year; he responded by saying, \\"I believe that this is the season of mercy.\\" Although the final report expected next week is unlikely to result in a dramatic change in doctrine, the change in tone and approach will have far-reaching effects on Catholic parishes worldwide. Under Pope Francis' guidance, the Catholic Church appears to be gradually moving away from strict and exclusive interpretations of its teachings, promoting a more open and compassionate attitude toward those it formerly shunned, such as gay and divorced Catholics. This development is significant, as it reflects an institution willing to adapt to the evolving needs of its members and maintain its relevance in modern society. In embracing diverse family models and recognizing the positive aspects that civil unions and cohabitation can bring, the Church seems to be taking a step towards a more compassionate and understanding environment that may encourage more people to engage with it. While the final report is still to be released, the shift in emphasis from judgment and exclusion to mercy and inclusion is undeniably significant. This change in perspective within the Catholic Church has the potential to impact the lives of many people, both within and beyond its congregation. It could help to break down barriers and prejudices that have long existed around topics such as homosexuality and divorce, encouraging a more inclusive and understanding society. In conclusion, the Vatican's move towards a more inclusive approach regarding gay and divorced Catholics, driven by Pope Francis, highlights a changing attitude that may eventually lead to a more compassionate and understanding Catholic Church. While final decisions have not yet been made, the synod's preliminary report indicates a willingness to adapt, promoting mercy and inclusion over strict adherence to traditional doctrines. This change in tone will likely have wide-reaching implications for Catholic parishes across the globe, fostering a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - sign checks - talk to each other - like popcorn - disagree with each other - read a newspaper Answer:","completion":"At the end of the week, the most suitable option from the given choices that a boss does is to sign checks. This is the most logical and relevant action given the context of the question, which revolves around ensuring people are paid for the job they've done. Sign checks: A boss, especially in smaller organizations, may be responsible for signing off on paychecks to ensure their employees receive their remuneration or wages for the work they've completed throughout the week. This is an essential part of a job, as timely and accurate payment is crucial to maintaining a positive work environment and good employer-employee relationships. Depending on the size and structure of the company, signing checks might also include validating timesheets, reviewing expenses, and ensuring all the payroll details are accurate. The other options are not directly related to employees getting paid for their work and don't necessarily make sense in this context: Talk to each other: While communication between a boss and their employees or colleagues is essential in any organization, it doesn't directly address the issue of ensuring employees are paid for their work. Effective communication may result in better overall work performance and smooth operations, but it doesn't necessarily relate to people getting paid at the end of the week. Like popcorn: This option holds no relevance to the context of the question. Liking popcorn is an individual preference and has no connection to ensuring employees are paid for their work. Disagree with each other: Similar to talking to each other, disagreeing with one another may occur naturally within an organization as people discuss work matters, propose ideas, and make decisions. However, this is not directly related to the payment of employees and is not a suitable answer to the question. Read a newspaper: While a boss might choose to read a newspaper during their downtime, breaks, or outside of work, this action doesn't address the issue of employees receiving payment for their work. It is unrelated to the main context of the question. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question of what the boss does at the end of the week to ensure people have to get paid for the job is to sign checks. This directly correlates with the remuneration process and emphasizes the boss's responsibility in overseeing payroll and employee compensation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I didn't care how uncomfortable he was; the suit was perfect.\\"On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were travelling by limousine to a New York airport for their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then reminded him that they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: \\"Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs.\\" Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: \\"Trust me, Bob, no one is going to recognize me\\", to which he replied: \\"Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you.\\" Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication. contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person whose defense lawyer was Bob Levine., what is it ?","completion":"The first name of the person whose defense lawyer was Bob Levine in the given article is Jimi, referring to Jimi Hendrix, the renowned guitarist and singer-songwriter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The T20 Blast quarter-final line-up: With both sides needing to win to have any chance of making the quarter-finals, Surrey's game against Kent was always likely to be full-blooded - and England limited-overs opener Jason Roy did not disappoint. His unbeaten 120 from 62 deliveries included 15 fours and a further three sixes, helping propel the hosts to 212-4 at The Oval. His opening partnership of 187 with Australia batsman Aaron Finch (79) was just five runs short of the biggest partnership in Twenty20 cricket in this country - and only 14 shy of the best opening stand of all time. It might have been enough to put the hosts through had Essex lost, but in the end the big-hitting was in vain as the abandonment at Chelmsford sent both Surrey and Kent out.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Does \\"Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2 – December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5 A but does not allow concurrent data transmission.\\" correctly answer the question of What is a downfall of the Battery Charging Specification?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2 – December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5 A but does not allow concurrent data transmission\\" does provide a correct answer to the question of what the downfall of the Battery Charging Specification is. However, let's expound on this topic further for better understanding. The Battery Charging Specification (BCS) is a standard developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) to enhance the charging capabilities of USB ports. It was introduced as a response to the evolving power requirements of modern devices, which led to the need for faster and more efficient charging methods. Version 1.2 of the Battery Charging Specification, introduced in December 2010, aimed to further improve the power handling capability of USB ports, raising it to an output of 1.5 A. While this increase in power output significantly reduced the time required to charge devices, it came with a notable drawback that can be considered as a major downfall of the BCS Version 1.2. This drawback is the inability to allow concurrent data transmission while charging a device. In practical terms, this means that when a device is connected to a BCS 1.2-compliant USB port for fast charging, it cannot transfer data simultaneously. The lack of concurrent data transmission support in BCS 1.2 raises potential issues for users who need to charge their devices and transfer data at the same time. This can lead to reduced productivity and inconvenience, particularly for those who use their devices frequently or rely on them for work. However, it is important to note that BCS 1.2 was meant to work primarily on dedicated charging ports (DCPs). These charging ports are designed specifically for charging purposes and do not have data transmission capabilities, making the compromise of losing data transfer functionality during charging less significant. In summary, the downfall of the Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2) is the inability to support concurrent data transmission while charging. Although this limitation is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it primarily affects dedicated charging ports, it can still be a source of inconvenience for users who require simultaneous data transfer and charging capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which country became landlocked as a result of the War of the Pacific (1879 to 1883)?","completion":"The country that became landlocked as a result of the War of the Pacific (1879 to 1883) was Bolivia. The War of the Pacific, also known as the Saltpeter War, was a conflict fought among Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. The primary reason for the war was a dispute over the possession of resource-rich territories in the Atacama Desert, particularly those containing valuable sodium nitrate (saltpeter) deposits, which were crucial for the production of fertilizers and explosives. Before the War of the Pacific, Bolivia had a coastline along the Pacific Ocean, with Atacama as part of its territory. The coastline played a significant role in Bolivia's international trade and provided an important source of national pride and identity. However, the war changed the geographical and geopolitical landscape of this region. The War of the Pacific began in 1879 when Bolivia attempted to impose taxes on a Chilean company operating in the area, violating an earlier boundary treaty between the two countries. In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia, and Peru was drawn into the conflict as well due to a secret defensive alliance with Bolivia. Over the course of the war, Chilean forces defeated both Peru and Bolivia, eventually occupying Lima, the Peruvian capital, in 1881. The war officially ended in 1883 with the signing of the Treaty of Ancón between Chile and Peru, and later in 1884, the Truce of Valparaíso between Chile and Bolivia. As a result of these treaties and the subsequent Treaty of Lima in 1929, Chile gained permanent control over the disputed territories, including the province of Tarapacá from Peru and Antofagasta from Bolivia. The loss of its coastal territory left Bolivia landlocked, which has had profound and lasting implications for the country's economic, political, and social development. Bolivia's landlocked status has negatively impacted its access to global trade and hampered its economic growth. Furthermore, the country has struggled to maintain efficient transportation and communication networks without direct access to the sea, resulting in increased reliance on neighboring countries for these needs. In the years since the War of the Pacific, Bolivia has made several attempts to regain a sovereign corridor to the Pacific Ocean through diplomatic means and negotiations with Chile, but these efforts have been unsuccessful. The issue of Bolivia's lack of coastal territory remains a matter of national concern and is a recurrent theme in the country's foreign policy, serving as a source of tension between Bolivia and Chile to this day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to who is the oldest bank in the world??","completion":"The oldest bank in the world is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, also known as BMPS or simply Monte dei Paschi. Located in Siena, Italy, it was founded on February 27, 1472. The bank was initially established as a mount of piety, which is a type of institutional pawnshop operated by a charity or benevolent institution, typically run by a religious group, intending to provide credit to individuals in the community. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was created to grant loans to the underprivileged at a more modest interest rate than what private lenders offered at the time. The founding of the bank can largely be attributed to the ordinance of the Magistrate for Public Order, which was formulated by the government of the Republic of Siena. The bank started its operations under the name \\"Monte di Pietà of Siena,\\" with its main goal being to fight usury. The idea for Monte dei Paschi came primarily from the Franciscan monk Bernardino of Feltre, a passionate advocate for helping people break free from the usurious lending practices he had seen in his travels. On December 10, 1472, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena made its first loans to eight borrowers, marking the beginning of its long history in the banking industry. As the bank grew, so did its activities, expanding to include deposits, financial investments, and granting loans to local institutions. During the following centuries, the bank took part in various economic and social changes, including the unification of Italy in the 19th century and the transformation of the banking system in the 20th century. Through its Monte dei Paschi Foundation, the bank has maintained its tradition of social responsibility, supporting culture and education in Siena and other parts of Italy and the world. Throughout its long history, the bank has faced various challenges, such as the global financial crisis in 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2010-2012. In recent years, the bank has struggled with financial difficulties, bad loans, and recapitalization needs, leading to European Union and Italian government interventions to ensure its stability. Despite these setbacks, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena remains a significant institution in the Italian and European banking landscape. In conclusion, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is the oldest bank in the world, founded in 1472 in Siena, Italy. Its origins are rooted in a benevolent and charitable mission to combat usury, but it has evolved to become a significant player in the banking industry. Though it has faced challenges in its storied history, the bank's longevity speaks to its resilience and ability to adapt to changing and sometimes tumultuous economic environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Published in 1998, the book is centered around the concept of change management and dealing with it in both work and life. The story features four characters, two mice named Sniff and Scurry, and two little people called Hem and Haw, who live in a maze. They all depend on cheese for their survival, which represents the goals, desires, or needs in real life. One day, the cheese supply they rely on starts to dwindle. The mice, Sniff and Scurry, anticipate the change and quickly adapt to search for a new source of cheese. They find a new cheese station and continue to thrive. On the other hand, the little people, Hem and Haw, initially resist change and struggle to accept the reality of their situation. Hem becomes frustrated and refuses to search for new cheese, while Haw slowly realizes that he must adapt to find new cheese or risk perishing. Haw eventually embarks on a journey to seek new cheese, learning valuable lessons about adapting to change along the way. In the end, Haw finds success in a new cheese station, reunited with Sniff and Scurry, while Hem's fate remains unknown, still resistant to change.

The chieftain (Manu Respall) demands Lando to give back something that belongs to them which he refuses. Angered, he and his tribesmen savagely killed him.Bikbok (Bugoy Carino) moved to an isolated town with his blind mother Isay (Maricar Reyes), his baby brother and his discontented stepfather Allan (Zanjoe Marudo) to survive poverty where Allan can take charge at the farm after his uncle Lando died earlier. The next day, Allan finds something under the house where he encounters an object that was buried by Lando earlier which reveals to be a crystal. At night, Bikbok watches outside and noticed the white creatures watching him.The next day, Allan's cousin Pey (Ervic Vijandre) takes Isay, Allan and Bikbok to Aling Epang (Celia Rodriguez) to cure their baby. After they leave when Bikbok began to collect some water, he saw a group of sparks and decide to follow it. He stops by where he finds a waterfall and began venturing it. When he plays at the waterfall, he notices the same creatures earlier are watching him. The chieftain orders his tribe to catch him as Bikbok runs. He attempts to escape but the creatures cornered him. The chieftain tells him to give back something which it was stolen but Bikbok assures that he and his family didn't steal anything. The chieftain tells him that if he didn't return it otherwise in the third day at night when the new moon arrives, he and his family will be in danger. Bikbok runs to Aling Epang for help and tells her on what he saw. Epang realizes the white creatures were the Tamawos, a group of fairy people who were creatures and tribal warriors who always take away people even children. After Bikbok tells her on what they have steal, Epang tells him that he need to find out what they have stolen because the tamawos will never stop until it was returned.

A:","completion":"Lando, a character from the movie \\"Shake, Rattle & Roll 13,\\" buries something under his house. This object turns out to be a crystal, which is later found by Allan, Bikbok's discontented stepfather. The movie's plot revolves around a family who moves to an isolated town to survive poverty and then comes into contact with a group of white creatures known as the Tamawos. The Tamawos are a group of fairy people who are also tribal warriors known for kidnapping people, including children. They confront Lando, the old man, and demand him to return something that belongs to them, but Lando refuses. Due to this, the chieftain and his tribesmen savagely kill Lando. As the story progresses, Bikbok, the protagonist, encounters the Tamawos and is informed that if he does not return the stolen object by the night of the third day when the new moon arrives, his family will be in danger. Bikbok, realizing the severity of the situation, seeks help from Aling Epang who informs him about the Tamawos and their history. In order to resolve the conflict, Bikbok must first find out what the stolen object is and why it is so important to the Tamawos. This will involve uncovering the truth behind the crystal that Allan discovered beneath the house and discovering what Lando's connection to the Tamawos was. The quest to return the stolen object to the Tamawos and protect Bikbok's family from grave danger will drive the movie's plot.

In this case, there is a \\"-\\" between \\"M\\" and \\"1600\\". So, the first segmentation is: \\"M - 1600LaserCutterMachineforfoils\\" 2. Next, I will identify the numeric part, \\"1600\\", which is most likely separate from the surrounding text. So, the segmentation becomes: \\"M - 1600 LaserCutterMachineforfoils\\" 3. Now, I will look for capital letters that can indicate the beginning of a new word. In this case, I see \\"Laser\\", \\"Cutter\\", and \\"Machine\\". The segmentation will look like this: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machineforfoils\\" 4. Continuing to identify capital letters for new words, I find the word \\"for\\". The segmentation now becomes: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machine forfoils\\" 5.

Background: Herbert Sutcliffe (24 November 1894 - 22 January 1978) was an English professional cricketer who represented Yorkshire and England as an opening batsman. Apart from one match in 1945, his first-class career spanned the period between the two world wars. His first-class debut was delayed by the First World War until 1919 and his career was effectively terminated in August 1939 when he was called up for military service in the imminent Second World War. He was the first cricketer to score 16 centuries in Test match cricket. Context: Sutcliffe and Len Hutton opened the Yorkshire innings in one championship match in 1934 and then, with Sutcliffe's Test career ending the following year, became the regular Yorkshire pairing until 1939 when the outbreak of war effectively ended Sutcliffe's career. Especially given that he was from Pudsey, Hutton was often portrayed as Sutcliffe's protege but Hutton maintained that it was the coaching of George Hirst that did most to develop his career. He said of Sutcliffe: \\"You do learn a lot from watching a player of Herbert's class. It was an enriching and invaluable experience to bat with him\\". Sutcliffe's view of Hutton was that he was \\"a marvel - the discovery of a generation\\". Hutton said that his shyness and the fact that he was twenty years younger than Sutcliffe made it difficult for him to approach his partner when he needed help, which he more readily got from Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity. About Sutcliffe he said: \\"I did not find it easy to talk to him\\". The master-apprentice relationship changed after Hutton scored a world record 364 for England against Australia at The Oval in 1938. Future Yorkshire captain Ronnie Burnet reckoned that Sutcliffe had been the dominant partner until then and their scores would be something like 60 to 40 in Sutcliffe's favour. After Hutton made his record, his confidence increased and Burnet said the ratio was reversed \\"to 70:30 in Len's favour\\". Burnet said that Hutton was \\"tearing attacks apart in 1939 and Herbert was by then playing second fiddle\\". Comparisons of the two Pudsey masters have been inevitable but there were essential differences in style. Bill Bowes said that Sutcliffe readily acknowledged the superior ability of Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond and Len Hutton but what Sutcliffe did have were the concentration and willpower to make the best of his abilities in any given situation. Hutton pinpointed the key difference by explaining that, when Sutcliffe was taking guard, \\"his weight was on the (front) left foot, enabling him to play the hook shot so well\\" whereas Hutton put his weight onto his (back) right foot. Hence Sutcliffe more easily moved back while Hutton developed a forward style. Another view, expressed by Sutcliffe's son Billy, who also played with Hutton for Yorkshire, was that Sutcliffe was \\"probably better in a crisis\\", as his numerous successes on bad or \\"sticky\\" wickets would suggest. Sutcliffe and Hutton made 16 century opening partnerships together, 15 of them for Yorkshire. Their highest was 315, which they achieved twice. Question: Did he bowl as well.

In a domestic violence case (in which I was the accused, but by God I was innocent) with my ex girlfriend, the lawyer whom I hired and paid his dues, openly played a wheeling and dealing game for two and a half years with the prosecutor and had mercilessly thrown me in front of the prosecutor. My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles’ child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled. After all these and after having me pushed into loosing my otherwise strong case, I was sentenced with restriction order to my own home, loosing all I had paid for it, loosing my stuff inside home, aforced probation and a forced domestic violence course for no good reason, my so called bloody lawyer also sent to the court a paper indicating that I owed to him and never had paid his dues. Disgusting wheeling and dealing quite often happen between such disgusting lawyers and greedy, heartless prosecutors; unfortunately! My psychologist friend at the time said, “If you are in Illinois, in Champaign County and you have a penis, you are already accepted as guilty by birth to start with dude”.

This led to unfair sentencing, including a restraining order, loss of property, probation, and mandatory participation in a domestic violence course. Furthermore, the lawyer falsely claimed that he was not paid, worsening the situation. The man also feels that there is a general prejudice against men in the legal system of his jurisdiction, as his psychologist friend suggested that being male is equated to guilt in Champaign County, Illinois."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" is \\"nerves\\", given that dilation makes the pupils sensitive? OPTIONS: (I) Yes; (II) No; The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: No. The question, \\"What makes the pupils sensitive?\\" requires a more detailed explanation rather than simply answering with \\"nerves.\\" It is important to understand the key components involved in the process of pupil sensitivity, such as the role of light, muscles, and the nervous system. Pupil sensitivity is primarily controlled by the amount of light entering the eyes and the ability of the iris (the colored part of the eye) to constrict or dilate the pupil in response to changes in light conditions. The process is called pupillary response or pupillary reflex, and it enables the eyes to adjust to different light levels to protect the retina and ensure optimal vision. The pupil is a small aperture in the center of the iris, which can change in size depending on the lighting conditions. Bright light causes the pupil to constrict (become smaller), limiting the amount of light entering the eye, whereas dim light causes the pupil to dilate (become larger), allowing more light to enter the eye. The whole process of pupillary response is controlled by a combination of nerves, muscles, and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has two main components: the sympathetic division (responsible for activating the \\"fight or flight\\" response) and the parasympathetic division (responsible for \\"rest and digest\\" activities). During the pupillary response, the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions work together to constrict or dilate the pupil. The parasympathetic division works via the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) to stimulate the circular muscle fibers of the iris, causing the pupil to constrict. In contrast, the sympathetic division stimulates the radial muscle fibers of the iris, leading to pupil dilation. In conclusion, while mentioning \\"nerves\\" is partially correct, it does not fully explore the depth and complexity of the factors that make pupils sensitive. A more comprehensive answer would consider how the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions, the muscles of the iris, and environmental light conditions all contribute to pupil sensitivity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: \\"I think,\\" he says, \\"I've cracked my rib.\\" Kerr sustained his injury \\"falling off the drum riser\\" in Brighton during the band's first show in 18 months, the night before our interview - but he's surprisingly blasÃ© about it. \\"I had enough whiskey to fall asleep,\\" he grins, \\"and a good friend of mine is a paramedic, so I had a shower at my house and went to see him. \\"I'm sure it's fine.\\" It's not the first time the band have been maimed in the line of duty. On their first UK tour four years ago, drummer Ben Thatcher dislocated his finger in the middle of a show. \\"He just got some gaffer tape and gaffered his two fingers together and played the rest of the set,\\" Kerr says, matter-of-factly. Later, on a US tour, their sound technician \\"lost a testicle\\", requiring emergency surgery. The details of that trauma are not up for discussion. Hopefully, then, the band will remain injury-free in the run-up to Glastonbury, where they're third on Friday's main stage bill, just behind Radiohead and The xx. \\"Glastonbury is such a big deal,\\" marvels Thatcher. \\"The Pyramid Stage is the biggest stage in the world.\\" The set will rely heavily on their second album, How Did We Get So Dark?, released this Friday. It's a record that takes their rampaging rock riffs and pushes them in unexpected directions. Lead single Lights Out contains bursts of 1970s T-Rex backing vocals, while the piano-led Hole In Your Heart reflects the band's love of R&B. The BBC sat down with the duo to talk about the perks of fame; the perils of touring; and why they have \\"a delicate sound\\". Here are six of their best stories. Recording How Did We Get So Dark? gave the band the opportunity to experiment with new sounds and techniques. It did not go well. \\"One thing we learned is we have quite a delicate sound and once you add things - the wrong things - our whole sound sort of shrivels,\\" says Mike. \\"Or it capsizes and it doesn't sound like us any more. We've realised a lot of the identity of our music is when me and Ben play together.\\" \\"Even the backing vocals - we did try having girls come in and sing, but it just didn't work. It had to be my voice. It had to be just about me and Ben.\\" Royal Blood are a compact unit. Ben plays drums. Mike plays bass and sings. For some reason, though, this set-up has mystified journalists everywhere. \\"'Why are you just a two-piece band?'\\" Mike sighs. \\"We get asked that all the time. I guarantee Kings Of Leon have never been asked why they're a quartet.\\" \\"Our whole two-piece thing really was not thought about at all,\\" he explains. \\"Once I plugged in [the bass] and showed Ben the sound, it was like, 'Cool, let's write the songs'. \\"I wasn't thinking, 'what if it wasn't just the two of us?'\\" \\"Making a record and writing for that long, you kind of forget what you're doing. And the whole premise of our band is that we're a live band. That's Royal Blood in its purest form.\\" As they toured the world, Royal Blood picked up a few celebrity hangers-on. After a show in San Franciso, Metallica's Lars Ulrich knocked on their dressing room door, bundled them into the back of a car and gave them a tour of his hometown. When Ben turned 27, Led Zeppelin star Jimmy Page turned up to his birthday party and ate an apple crumble. Best of all, the drummer was invited to play Tommy Lee's giant \\"drum rollercoaster,\\" which travelled, upside down above the audience's heads on Motley Crue's 2015 farewell tour. \\"It's insane. He's insane,\\" laughs Ben. \\"I went down to Wembley Arena, they strapped me in and then, when it started going up, I just thought, 'What am I doing?' \\"I hadn't thought about it properly. I was like, 'This is going to be so much fun' and then it was terrifying.\\" Still, he managed to compose himself and thrash out a few solos. \\"It's a different kind of playing. When you're upside down you're fighting the gravity. But it's a roller-coaster. The adrenalin lets you do things that you can't normally do.\\" Back in 2015, Mike told Q Magazine he'd written \\"about 50\\" new songs for Royal Blood's second album. A claim which turns out to have been a big fat whopper. \\"I said that two days after we came off tour,\\" he laughs. \\"They went, 'How many songs have you written?' and I said 50. \\"I thought it was funny because we'd only been working on the album for two days.\\" In the end, though, the band wrote more than that, recording a procession of demos and rough drafts in a rehearsal space in Burbank, Los Angeles. \\"A lot of our songs start as very small ideas - something as little as a drumbeat or a riff,\\" says Mike. \\"Anything creative gets recorded, basically. \\"We build a library of ideas, and the ones that really get into our heads and stick around, we usually see them through and build them into songs.\\" Cracked ribs and broken fingers aside, the band have upped the stakes at their live shows by trying to replicate the layered textures of their second album. \\"I was worried we'd snookered ourselves,\\" admits Mike, \\"I considered getting other musicians in, and then Ben saved the day. It's so impressive when you watch it.\\" On stage, the drummer not only has to play his own, intricate rhythm tracks, but triggers all the sampled backing vocals and sound effects that pepper the new record. He does this without playing to a click-track, locked to the tempo of the recorded elements, to stop him drifting out of time. \\"There's one sample that's 16 bars long,\\" says Mike, looking worried by the mere thought of it. \\"It's a long, slow pitch bend that if you play the song too fast, you miss it. \\"But Ben's a wizard, so that helps.\\" \\"We've stopped playing some of the songs from the first album,\\" says Mike. \\"There's a few that we've grown out of. There might be the odd lyric that I wouldn't say any more. I guess I don't agree with myself like I used to!\\" In fact, confesses Ben, they dropped Careless during their 2015 tour, despite only having 10 songs to choose for the set list from their debut album. \\"It is a good song,\\" he says. \\"We just don't get the buzz from playing it live.\\" Similarly, Ten Tonne Skeleton, frequently a highlight of their live shows \\"isn't much fun to play, for some reason\\". \\"It's quite laborious,\\" says Mike, \\"but as soon as we start into it, you see the crowd go nuts, and that's a real buzz.\\" How Did We Get So Dark? is released on Friday, 16 June.

Dan (Bob's dad) has very high cholesterol. 2. Mary (Bob's mom) has normal cholesterol levels. We know that high cholesterol can lead to the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which may restrict blood flow. Since Dan has very high cholesterol, it is more likely that he has more plaques in his arteries compared to Mary. On the other hand, Mary has normal cholesterol levels, which means she is less likely to have significant plaque buildup.

Article:Colin Swatton is much more than just a caddie to the Australian star who broke his major duck with victory at the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits on Sunday. Swatton's support helped his ailing boss complete the US Open at Chambers Bay. Within two months Day fulfilled his golfing potential in brilliant style with a record-breaking major championship score of 20 under par. To have risen from such a stricken position to the top of the golfing world, reflects the journey Day has taken in life with Swatton as mentor, coach and caddie. It is little wonder that Day tearfully embraced Swatton immediately after tapping in the putt that gave him a three-shot victory over new world number one Jordan Spieth. \\"On the 18th all I said was 'I love you',\\" Swatton said. \\"And he loves me, and we were a blubbering mess. It was pretty cool. \\"This makes me incredibly proud. To stand on the 18th green and share that moment. \\"I knew with the work ethic and the drive and the motivation, the skills would develop over time. He will continue to grow and to get better.\\" It was Swatton who played the father figure after Day's father died from cancer. The young Queenslander was in serious danger of going off the rails and the then teacher at the Hills International Golf Academy was his saviour. \\"He's been there for me since I was 12 and a half years old,\\" Day said. \\"He's taken me from a kid that was getting into fights at home and getting drunk at 12 and not heading in the right direction to a major champion. \\"And there's not many coaches that can say that in many sports. So he means the world to me. I love him to death.\\" Golf's newest major champion only took up the game when his late father rescued an old three wood from a rubbish dump. It only became Day's salvation because it brought him into contact with Swatton, who imposed a disciplined coaching regime. \\"Growing up, we - my mom - we were poor,\\" Day said. Following his father's death, his mother needed to take out a second mortgage. On Sunday her son banked a cheque for 1.8m with the untold riches that will inevitably follow from sponsors and backers. It's a far cry from the moment in June when he lay on the ninth fairway at Chambers Bay, his head spinning with the vertigo condition that made standing up impossible. Yet Day still managed to play well enough the following day to earn a share of the lead going into the final round of the US Open. He ultimately faded to finish in a share of ninth. Doctors were then able to identify the cause of the dizziness that seemed to threaten his career and, properly treated, Day was a refreshed figure when he turned up at St Andrews for The Open in July. Again he shared the lead going into the final round and again he wasn't up to it in the final analysis. Day left short a birdie putt on the final green to miss the play-off by a single stroke. He squeezed shut his eyes in anguish. It was another near miss in a major and a sixth top-four finish in one of the big four tournaments in a still young career. Even though he was only 27 years old, observers were starting to wonder whether he had what it took to land one of the game's biggest prizes. In regular tour events his winning ratio was poor before a big breakthrough the week after St Andrews. At the Canadian Open he birdied the last three holes to clinch only his fourth PGA Tour title. And the way he compiled a brilliant front-running 67 to hold Spieth at bay in the final round at Whistling Straits spoke volumes for how he has graduated to the upper echelons of the game. Spieth is at the vanguard having taken over from Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings but Day may prove capable of joining the budding rivalry that will propel a new era for the game. Day has shown talent to suggest he can sit alongside Spieth and McIlroy, who respectively spearhead American and European golf. Day offers an Australian dimension which offers exciting potential for the global game. As Swatton observed: \\"We are approaching another big three in golf.\\" There's a long way to go before Spieth, McIlroy and Day can be regarded in the same was as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, who comprised the original big three. But maybe, somewhere in the future, that moment will come. Swatton is well worth listening to - just ask Jason Day. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Colin Swatton, mentor, coach, and caddie to Australian golfer Jason Day, played a crucial role in Day's journey to achieving a record-breaking major championship score of 20 under par at the US PGA Championship. Swatton has been there for Day since he was a young teenager, helping him overcome personal struggles and ultimately developing him into a major champion. With Swatton's continued support and guidance, Jason Day now finds himself among the emerging rivalry alongside golfers Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, offering an Australian perspective and potential in the global golf scene."},{"prompt":"What's the answer to that question: who is kristen stewart parents?

Here's why: 1. Budget constraints: People usually have a specific budget in mind when shopping, and comparing prices allows them to select items that fit within their financial means. 2. Value for money: Consumers want to get the best value for their money, so they will compare prices among similar products to determine which offers the best quality and features at the most reasonable price point. 3. Promotions and deals: Shoppers often compare prices to identify deals, promotions, or discounts, so they can save money on purchases. 4. Brand loyalty vs. cost: Some buyers have preferences for specific brands, but they might still compare prices with other brands to ensure they are not overpaying for a particular product. While the other options mentioned (spending of money, have fun, splurge, and purchasing) are all related to shopping in some ways, they are not directly linked to the decision-making process when evaluating what to buy at a shop.

Please answer this question: when was the ban lifted on semi automatic weapons?","completion":"The ban on semi-automatic weapons in the United States has gone through various stages and has been a topic of continuous debate. One of the most notable attempts to control access to these firearms was the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), which was passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The AWB prohibited the manufacture, transfer, and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms classified as assault weapons, as well as large capacity ammunition magazines that could hold more than ten rounds. The ban, signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 13, 1994, was a significant effort to restrict access to semi-automatic weapons, including those used in some high-profile mass shootings. However, the AWB contained a sunset provision, which stipulated that the law would expire after ten years, unless it was reauthorized by Congress. Thus, the ban on semi-automatic weapons was lifted on September 13, 2004, when the law expired due to Congress's failure to reauthorize the legislation. This marked the end of the federal restrictions on semi-automatic weapons in the United States. It is important to note that the expiration of the federal ban did not entirely affect state-level restrictions on semi-automatic firearms. Some states, like California, Connecticut, and New York, among others, have implemented their own bans or restrictions on the sale or possession of certain assault weapons and large capacity magazines. Since the expiration of the AWB, there have been multiple attempts to reintroduce and reauthorize the act, particularly in the wake of mass shootings involving semi-automatic weapons. Debate surrounding the issue remains contentious, with strong arguments on both sides. Gun control advocates argue that reinstating the ban would reduce the frequency and severity of mass shootings, while opponents believe it infringes on constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights and may not effectively address the root causes of gun violence. In summary, the most significant federal ban on semi-automatic weapons, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, was lifted on September 13, 2004, when the legislation expired. State-level restrictions, however, still exist in some states across the US. The debate on semi-automatic weapons continues, and the potential for future regulations or bans remains a possibility depending on the political climate and public sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is a causeway different from a bridge? What is the difference between a culvert and a bridge?

It could be built using different materials such as rocks, gravel, or earth and can either be solid or allow water to flow through it. A bridge is a structure that spans and provides a crossing over a body of water, valley, or road. It is typically built with strong support systems, allowing the weight of vehicles and pedestrians to be safely distributed. A culvert is a structure, usually a pipe or tunnel, designed to carry water under a road or other obstruction, such as a bridge, to allow the passage of water without damage to the road or the environment. Step 3: Compare the differences between the key terms A causeway is a raised pathway built on wet or low-lying ground, while a bridge is a structure that spans across a gap, such as water or a valley. A causeway can be solid or allow water to flow through it, but a bridge has open space beneath it. A culvert, on the other hand, is designed for carrying water under a structure such as a road or bridge, whereas a bridge itself is a structure built above water, allowing passage over it. Step 4: Determine if the two questions are paraphrases of each other Although both questions compare the differences between other structures and a bridge, they mention different structures (causeway versus culvert). Therefore, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other but distinct inquiries since they aim to compare and differentiate a bridge from two separate structures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No one can tell exactly whether the shares will be doing well. The factory or company may do badly. Then the stocks will go down, and the investors will lose money. The stock may go up or down for a number of untold reasons. Everyone wants the stock to go up, but sometimes even if a factory or company does a good job, the stock may still go down. Going to the stock market is often like gambling . All want to make money by \\"gambling' in the stock market. Factories and companies that need money are pleased that so many people are ready to \\"gamble\\". Indeed, the stock market is an attractive but part of the business world.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader?

She was not just any woman, but the niece of the powerful Lord Capulet. This love was a secret affair, for Romeo belonged to the Montague family, sworn enemies of the Capulets. Always seeking an opportunity to see his beloved, Romeo confided in his closest friends, Benvolio and Mercutio. These two shared their own romantic pursuits, hoping to meet the captivating Rosaline, a close friend of Capulet's niece. Together, the trio hatched a plan to attend a masquerade ball being held at the lavish Capulet mansion. With their identities concealed, they felt they could safely pursue their respective love interests. That night, as they entered the majestic ballroom, the air was filled with excitement, love, and the promise of new beginnings. Little did they know that their actions would soon change the course of their lives forever. As the night progressed, each found an opportunity to connect with the objects of their affection. Romeo, however, became spellbound as he caught sight of the lovely Juliet, Lord Capulet's daughter. In that moment, he realized that his love for Capulet's niece paled in comparison to this newfound passion. As fate would have it, this budding love between Romeo and Juliet would be the catalyst that would ultimately end the violent war between the Capulets and the Montagues. Their love was like a beacon, illuminating the dark places in the hearts of the feuding families and showing them the futility of their strife. For the first time in generations, the possibility of peace seemed within their grasp. However, this path to peace would not come without its trials. Tragedy struck when Tybalt, cousin to Juliet, challenged Romeo to a duel. In the ensuing altercation, Mercutio was fatally injured and Romeo, in a fit of grief and rage, killed Tybalt in retaliation. His actions horrified both families and sent shockwaves through the city. The Prince of Verona intervened in the wake of the violence. Unable to ignore the impact of the bitter feud on his domain any longer, he decreed that Romeo must be banished for his part in the loss of Tybalt's life. The news devastated both families, who had begun to see the possibility of peace through the young lovers. Juliet's heartbreak at Romeo's banishment was immeasurable, and Romeo's anguish at leaving his newfound love behind mirrored her pain. In the absence of Romeo, Juliet's father decided it was time to go forth with previous plans he had made for his daughter. Unbeknownst to him, these plans would only serve to drive the young lovers further into despair. He brought news that Juliet was to wed the noble and wealthy Count Paris, believing this union would provide stability and happiness for his daughter, as well as potentially forge new alliances for the Capulet family. As the news spread, it fueled the desperate and tragic course that fate had set in motion. With Romeo banished, Benvolio and Mercutio's dreams of love crushed, and the impending marriage of Juliet and Paris, the stage was set for the ultimate resolution of the ancient feud between the Capulets and Montagues. In a tale of star-crossed lovers, friendship, and loyalty, the story of Romeo and Juliet remains a timeless testament to the power of love to triumph over adversity. Their love, which ultimately brought peace to their warring families, was not without its challenges, its tears, and its devastating losses. However, in the end, it proved that love, in all its forms, has the power to change hearts, mend ancient rifts, and create a world where peace can finally take root."},{"prompt":"Teacher:This task is to translate a news commentary given in French language into Russian language.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Paragraph: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans. Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student studied about a village that had a lower birth rate? A:","completion":"Harry B: Kim The correct answer is B: Kim. Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement before humans invented agriculture.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The world, in painter Chen Xiao's eyes, is as colorful and sweet as ice cream. At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years. Options: A To have an exhibition.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, (26 June 1824 - 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. William's father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler. He also won the First Smith's Prize, which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \\"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\\" While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843. He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of mathematics, physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of Faraday's idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \\"dielectric\\", and not by some incomprehensible \\"action at a distance\\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related. He was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845. On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault, at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a learned professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student but a few years before. What did he do as a fellow?","completion":"As a fellow, William Thomson spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault in Paris.

Remote cameras in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest have captured several images of a black female in the same area as OR-7, who has been on the move since 2011 in search of new territory and a mate to form a new pack. The images were recovered Wednesday by John Stephenson, wolf biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of an ongoing wolf monitoring program by state and federal wildlife biologists. \\"This information is not definitive, but it is likely that this new wolf and OR-7 have paired up,\\" Stephenson said. He said transmissions from OR-7's radio collar also indicate the two have denned. \\"If that is correct, they would be rearing pups at this time of year,\\" Stephenson said. The two have never been in the same shot but they have passed the camera not long after each other, indicating they are aware of each other. Biologists determined that the black wolf was a female because she's smaller than OR-7 and squats to urinate. U.S. biologists and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife will wait until June or later to confirm whether there are pups. If the two have produced offspring, they would be the first wolves known to breed in the Oregon Cascades since the early 20th century. Evidence of another wolf in the Cascades surfaced in December, when biologists found tracks on the eastern slopes of Mount Hood. But there is no indication that those were the tracks of the black wolf, Stephenson said. The news of an OR-7 mate drew cheers from wildlife advocates. \\"For people who appreciate native wildlife in Oregon, the news doesn't get any bigger than this,\\" said Rob Klavins of Oregon Wild. The discovery comes as the OR-7 Expedition readies a 1,200-mile trek retracing as much as possible of OR-7's path. The group of people, including a wolf ecologist, wildlife educator and filmmaker, will spend 42 days traveling from the Eagle Cap Wilderness in Oregon to the Crater Lake area and finally to Mount Shasta in California. OR-7 is believed to be the first confirmed wolf in western Oregon since the last one was killed under a livestock protection bounty program in 1947. He is also the first confirmed wolf in California since 1924. He was born in spring 2009 in the shadow of the Eagle Cap Wilderness in northeastern Oregon as part of the Imnaha pack. In February 2011, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists collared him with a Global Positioning System device. OR-7 left the pack in September, 2011, days after the state issued a kill order for his father and sibling for preying on livestock. Most Oregon wolves that have taken off on similar journeys, called dispersals, have stayed in the northeastern sector of the state or ventured into Idaho. Lately, OR-7 has spent most of his time in the southwest Cascades, making occasional forays into California. The wolf's collar has eclipsed its normal life span though it is still sending signals. Biologists had said they would not replace it, but Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the agency would now re-evaluate that. \\"We definitely want to keep at least one animal collared,\\" Stephenson said. \\"Now is not the time to do it. It's a sensitive time and OR-7s collar is still going strong.\\" Biologists will monitor OR-7 and the other wolf using remote cameras, collecting DNA from any scat discovered and by surveying the pups when appropriate. At the end of last year, there were 64 known wolves in Oregon. Except for OR-7, most are in the northeast. The animals are protected under the state and federal Endangered Species acts. -- Lynne Terry ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location.

In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's). - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Internet radio (also web radio, net radio, streaming radio, e-radio, online radio, webcasting) is an audio service transmitted via the Internet.

It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \\"The Burning\\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox. The protection of the Great Plains fell under the Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 mi.2, encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock was assigned to the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in Sioux and Cheyenne raids that attacked mail coaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also killed and kidnapped a considerable number of settlers on the frontier. Under pressure from the governors, General Grant turned to Sheridan. In September 1866, Sheridan arrived at the former Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg, Texas, where he spent three months subduing Indians in the Texas Hill Country. In August 1867, Grant appointed Sheridan to head the Department of the Missouri and pacify the Plains. His troops, even supplemented with state militia, were spread too thin to have any real effect. He conceived a strategy similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Winter Campaign of 1868-69 (of which the Battle of Washita River was part) he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters, taking their supplies and livestock and killing those who resisted, driving the rest back into their reservations. When Sherman was promoted to General of the Army following Grant's election as President of the United States, Sheridan was appointed to command the Military Division of the Missouri, with all the Great Plains under his command. Professional hunters, trespassing on Indian land, killed over 4 million bison by 1874, and Sheridan applauded: \\"Let them kill, skin and sell until the buffalo is exterminated\\". When the Texas legislature considered outlawing bison poaching on tribal lands, Sheridan personally testified against it, suggesting that the legislature should give each of the hunters a medal, engraved with a dead buffalo on one side and a discouraged-looking Indian on the other. Eventually the Indians returned to their designated reservations. Sheridan's department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, which resulted in the death of a trusted subordinate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were almost over by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the U.S. Army. Comanche Chief Tosawi reputedly told Sheridan in 1869, \\"Tosawi, good Indian,\\" to which Sheridan supposedly replied, \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.\\" In Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown attributed the quote to Sheridan, stating that \\"Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Sheridan denied he had ever made the statement. Biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" This variation \\"has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.\\" Entity:","completion":"Philip Henry Sheridan"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead.

Article: President Obama on Friday sought to deploy the game-changing powers of his office against a grim political week during which the economy, the polls and even some of his Democratic allies seemed to conspire against him. But the bully pulpit failed him, as well. Laying out his economic argument at a morning news conference, Obama said that cutbacks in state and local government spending have slowed the nation’s recovery and that Congress has “no excuse” for not supporting his jobs bill that would provide funding to retain public workers. “The private sector,” the president added as a point of comparison, “is doing fine.” The remark struck a discordant political note in the current economic climate, and Republican adversaries pounced on the assertion to lampoon him for being out of touch. And at least politically, Obama played directly into the GOP argument that he does not understand the depths of the economic crisis and that he is too dependent on government to solve the economy’s problems. At a campaign appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa, presidential rival Mitt Romney accused Obama of an “extraordinary miscalculation” that will “go down in history.” “Is he really that out of touch?” Romney said. “He’s defining what it means to be detached and out of touch with the American people.” Obama aides scrambled to contain the fallout, complaining that Republicans had intentionally mischaracterized the president’s remarks. But by midafternoon, after the White House had lost another round of the news-cycle wars, Obama felt compelled to clarify his position. “It’s absolutely clear the economy is not doing fine,” Obama said, speaking to reporters from the Oval Office after meeting with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III. “The economy needs to be strengthened. I believe that there are a lot of Americans who are hurting right now, which is what I’ve been saying . . . since I came into office. And the question then is, what are we going to do about it?” The episode reinforced the impression that the White House and the Obama campaign were struggling to regain their footing after a difficult week, and that they clearly remained off balance. Over the course of seven days, Obama endured the Labor Department’s dismal May jobs report, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s victory in a recall election against an Obama-endorsed challenger, and former president Bill Clinton arguing in favor of temporarily extending the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, which Obama opposes. In addition, the Romney campaign for the first time raised more money, reporting a 77 million haul in May compared with the Obama campaign’s 60 million. The president’s setbacks have coincided with a tightening of the polls in the presidential race as Romney has closed the gap with the president at a faster clip than even some GOP political analysts had envisioned. Matthew Dowd, a strategist for Bush’s 2004 presidential campaign, said that although Obama’s campaign team had prepared to face Romney for more than a year, its message has been muddled. The Obama team has attacked Romney as a “flip- flopper” and as an “ultra-right-wing conservative,” Dowd said, before more recently questioning his background in the private sector. “I would have thought they’d be prepared with a singular disqualifying argument on Romney and prosecute the case fully and forcefully for the past five or six weeks,” Dowd said. “They’ve done neither.” Perhaps more than Romney, however, it is the relentless nature of the European debt crisis that poses the biggest threat to the Obama campaign. The crisis threatens to further curtail U.S. growth with dire consequences for the economy, but solutions remain well out of the president’s control. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argued recently that the election hinges more on the fate of the economy this year than it has in decades. To Galston, Obama has focused too much on trying to define Romney rather than offering a compelling case to voters that he is making progress on the economy. In May, the economy added just 69,000 jobs — one-third as many as two months before — and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2­percent. “Obama has a lot riding on the credibility of his basic economic message of ‘We’ve surmounted a crisis, we’re moving in the right direction — maybe not fast enough, but why would we turn back?’ ” Galston said. The president’s worry over Europe was evident Friday, when he opened his news conference by renewing calls on euro-zone leaders to strengthen their currency through a combination of growth initiatives and financial austerity measures. Later in the day, Obama called French President Francois Hollande, whose push for new spending to help stimulate growth dovetails with Obama’s message in the United States. Obama and Hollande discussed their strategy ahead of the Group of 20 economic summit in Mexico in two weeks. But the president offered no new economic proposals for growth at home. Instead, he urged Congress to reconsider its opposition to the American Jobs Act that his administration rolled out in the fall. Although lawmakers did approve some of that bill’s provisions, including an extension to the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment insurance, major initiatives aimed at giving states money to retain teachers, firefighters and police officers were blocked by Republicans. During his remarks, Obama noted that the economy had added 4.3 million jobs over the past 27 months, but he stressed that public-sector employment has lagged because of deep cuts to state and municipal budgets. In Iowa, Romney ridiculed Obama’s call for “another stimulus” to hire more government workers, and he cited the results of the Wisconsin recall election as evidence that the public was fed up with big government — Walker won reelection despite enraging unions after pushing to eliminate collective-bargaining rights. Obama “says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin?” Romney said. “The American people did. It’s time for us to cut back on government.” Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said that Obama was accurate to argue that the private sector, which is growing at a rate of 3 percent, has outpaced the public sector. Yet Zandi added that while the private-sector pace would be acceptable in a healthy economy, it is “not anything anyone will feel comfortable with given the 8.2 percent unemployment rate. That’s not fine.” Staff writer Philip Rucker in Iowa contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — President Barack Obama on Friday took a more strident tone with Europe in contrast to two years of quiet prodding, urging the region’s leaders to aid the troubled banking sector and warning of the fallout if Greece were to leave the euro zone. And on the domestic front, the president ignited a fire-storm of reaction when he said in a brief news conference that “the private sector is doing fine,” noting that the American labor market had created 800,000 jobs in the last year. Obama later backed away from his remarks on the economy, saying that it was “absolutely clear that the economy is not doing fine.” See our analysis. With regards to Europe, Obama said he has tried hard over the past two years not to scold Europeans and be constructive. But in his comments to reporters in the White House briefing room, Obama basically gave Europe a “to-do” list. Click to Play Obama on the economy Paul Vigna talks with Kathleen Madigan about the president’s comments on the U.S. and global economy. “The good news is there is a path out of this challenge,” Obama said. In the short-term, Europe must stabilize its financial system and inject capital into weak banks as soon as possible, Obama said. Spain is expected on Saturday to request aid for its banks.Read more on Spain. European leaders must also show a political commitment to a stronger euro zone and fiscal integration, he said. “It is in everybody’s interest for Greece to remain in the euro zone” and respect its prior commitments, Obama said. “The Greek people also need to recognize that their hardships will likely be worse if they leave the euro zone,” he said. Greece holds national elections on June 17. Obama also repeated his support for a new growth agenda for Europe to go along with the existing tough austerity plans. Urges Congress to do more At the same time, Obama urged Congress to reconsider his jobs plan, saying that it would help state and local governments and the construction industry, which he called the weakest sectors of the economy. Obama said that the labor market had created 800,000 jobs in the last year and “the private sector is doing fine.” “If Republicans want to be helpful, if they really want to move forward and put people back to work, what they should be thinking about is, ‘How do we help state and local governments?’ and, ‘How do we help the construction industry?’” he said. So far, Republican plans would slow growth and create fewer jobs, he said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In June 2012, President Obama faced criticism from his opponents, including then-presidential rival Mitt Romney, for his remark \\"the private sector is doing fine\\" during a news conference addressing the economic climate.

This remark led to accusations of the president being out of touch with the economic crisis and too reliant on government. Obama later clarified his position, stating that the economy was not doing fine and required strengthening.

The tool operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular. To test the accuracy of the data, Google compared its figures against statistics filed over the past five years by the US Centers for Disease Control. It has a network of 1,500 doctors across the US who provide weekly reports on the number of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms. \\"We found we could highly accurately estimate what the flu activity levels would be in those years,\\" Ginsberg said.

The climax of a story is a literary element.","completion":"Yes, based on the description provided in the text, it is true that the climax is the point of highest tension and drama in a narrative work. The term \\"climax\\" is derived from the Greek word κλῖμαξ, which means \\"staircase\\" or \\"ladder,\\" suggesting a progression towards a peak or culmination. The climax is a crucial aspect of storytelling and serves as a pivotal moment in the plot of a story. It is at this juncture that the central conflict reaches its most intense and decisive point, usually involving high stakes, emotions, and risks for the characters involved. This moment is the result of a build-up of tension and suspense throughout the narrative, which keeps the reader or audience engaged and invested in the story. As a literary element, the climax serves several important purposes, some of which are: 1. Resolution of the central conflict: The climax often provides the resolution to the primary conflict or problem that the characters have faced throughout the story. It usually presents a decisive turning point that determines the outcome of the narrative and sets the course for the conclusion or denouement. 2. Emotional engagement: The climax is the moment when the emotions evoked by the story reach their peak, engaging the reader or audience to a greater extent. This emotional engagement contributes to the overall impact and memorability of the story. 3. Character development: The climax often serves as a critical point for character development, as the choices and actions of the characters in facing the climactic challenge can reveal their true nature, motivations, and growth throughout the story. 4. Heightened tension: By positioning the climax as the point of highest tension and drama, the story maintains a sense of anticipation and keeps the reader or audience hooked. The climax also often signifies a turning point where the action starts to resolve, and the narrative begins to move towards its conclusion. 5. Structural significance: The climax typically occurs around the two-thirds or three-quarters point of the story, functioning as a structural marker and creating a solid narrative arc. The events leading up to the climax are called the rising action, while the events following the climax that tie up any loose ends and bring the story to a close are known as the falling action and denouement. In summary, the climax is the point of highest tension and drama in a story, marking a decisive moment that ultimately influences the narrative's outcome. As a literary element, the climax is essential for developing character, engaging emotions, maintaining suspense, and providing a structural framework for the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The government expects the extension of flexible working rights to be of particular interest to older workers approaching retirement and to young workers looking for additional training while they work. \\"Modern businesses know that flexible working boosts productivity and staff morale, and helps them keep their top talent so that they can grow,\\" said Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. \\"It's about time we brought working practices bang up-to-date with the needs, and choices, of our modern families.\\" The Chartered Institute of Personnel Development said the change in the law was recognition of the growing importance of flexible working for both employees and employers. \\"Employers increasingly recognise the strong business case for flexible working, including enhanced employee engagement and the attraction and retention of a more diverse workforce,\\" said the institute's chief executive Susannah Clements. The TUC welcomed the move, but said more needed to be done to ensure that employees' requests were given fair consideration. \\"When you make a flexible working request you also need a fair hearing, so we should improve things further by giving people a right to challenge an employer's reason for rejecting a request,\\" said the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady. Many businesses already offer flexible working to their staff. \\"We know from our own membership that more than three quarters of our members offer flexible working but there will be a small number of small businesses who just will not be able to do that, whether it's through cost or just from balancing their teams,\\" Liesl Smith from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) told the BBC. The FSB has expressed concerns about the additional administrative burden the right to request flexible working might place on small businesses.

Q: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

In Hospital Scrubs and Officer’s Blues, a Kinship And all too often over the years, it has been the place where familiar figures in blue are carried in on stretchers. Between the local police and emergency workers at the hospital, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, a director of trauma surgery at Kings County, “there is a kinship. You do develop relationships.” Last Monday, Officer Yan was brought into the Kings County emergency room with a bullet wound in his left arm. He and his partner, Officer Russel Timoshenko, had pulled over a stolen sport utility vehicle, and its occupants opened fire on them. Officer Yan was recovering at home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, but Officer Timoshenko, who was shot in the throat and mouth, died yesterday at the hospital. The three men who the police said were in the car have been arrested. Officers Yan and Timoshenko were stationed in the hospital’s home precinct, the 71st, whose members are particularly dear to the staff. “With these people from the 71st and the 67th, we see a lot of them,” Dr. Kurtz said. “Of the ones I know personally, I would be as horrified if they were injured as if they were in my family.” Officer Yan, speaking by phone on Friday, said that he was sent to Kings County on the job at least once a week. “For anything,” he said. “Even a mother that reports their child missing, after we search their building, we’ll call in and say, ‘Sarge, is it O.K. if we swing by the hospital and see if she’s there?’ ” While Officer Yan said he had not become particularly close to anyone in the emergency room — “I’m not great with the nurses, but I recognize their faces” — he said he felt welcome every time he walked in. “They’re always very friendly with us,” Officer Yan said. The camaraderie between big-city police officers and nurses, forged in the heat of trauma, is of course a staple of television dramas and movies like “Hill Street Blues” and “Fort Apache, the Bronx.” Tom Rowe, a longtime police officer in Queens who became an emergency room nurse and now trains hospital workers on Long Island, said the cliché was well grounded in reality. Police officers are often able to provide emergency room staff with crucial information about the people they bring in. “When I have police come in from the scene,” he said, “if there’s a motor vehicle accident, I can find out where the damage to the vehicle was, the speed the car was traveling; then, as a clinician, I can get a better idea of the kinds of injuries I’ll find.” But it is more than that, he said. “Basically, you’re allies,” Mr. Rowe said. “You depend on each other.” As a result, an injured officer might be “up-triaged a little bit” at the hospital, he said. He added: “That’s a respect, a professional courtesy. They don’t disregard the patients that are there, but you get a quicker look.” Certainly, the Kings County emergency room is no stranger to the swirl of adrenaline and action that accompanies the injury of an officer in the line of duty. In 2004, two veteran detectives from the 67th Precinct who were shot in East Flatbush spent their dying moments in the emergency room. “The officers looked bad, but the paramedics were working them real good, pumping their chests hard,” The Daily News quoted a hospital security guard as saying. “There was blood all over the stretchers, and other cops were yelling, ‘Hurry, hurry, rush him, rush him!’ ” In 2005, Officer Dillon Stewart of the 70th Precinct was taken to the hospital after he was shot nearby. In the emergency room, a dozen doctors and nurses went to work on him. One doctor took the officer’s heart in his hands and gently clapped it until it began to beat again, though Officer Stewart, too, eventually died. And in a terrifying episode in 1994, a prisoner being treated at the hospital jumped off an examining table, wrestled away a correction officer’s revolver, shot another officer and briefly took a 7-year-old hostage before the first officer shot him dead. Last Wednesday, in the gap between Monday’s police shooting and Officer Timoshenko’s death, it was just another night in the Kings County emergency room. The bleary-eyed injured held towels or gauze to their wounds while they waited. A police officer walked into the waiting room, thumbs jammed in his belt, looking beat. His face brightened a little when he saw a nurse in orange scrubs. “Hey, baby, how you doing?” she shouted almost maternally across the room. “Oh, not bad, not bad,” the officer said, half yawning. “Come here,” the nurse said. “Let me give you some love.” Yesterday afternoon, at a news conference shortly after Officer Timoshenko died, Dr. Kurtz emerged from the hospital. He stood beside Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to address the latest loss. “This is a really tragic case,” Dr. Kurtz said, “one that affected us emotionally as well as professionally.” He switched modes briefly to describe in clinical detail how the bullets transected Officer Timoshenko’s spinal cord just beneath his brain. Then he spoke of Officer Timoshenko’s family. “For his mother to have lost her son like that,” he said, choking up, “it brings tears to my eyes.” The trauma surgeon stood beside the police commissioner for a few more questions. Then they wheeled away from the cameras and walked back into the hospital. Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Michael Brick, Daryl Khan and Colin Moynihan.

Background: Identifying the bacteria and viruses present in a complex sample is useful in disease diagnostics, product safety, environmental characterization, and research. Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced. We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages), bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence. Results: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR. The MDA can be used to identify the suite of viruses and bacteria present in complex samples.","completion":"Title: Pan-Microbial Detection Array for Comprehensive Identification of Viruses, Bacteria, and Plasmids in Complex Samples Using Novel Statistical Analysis"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Ali Hassan's body is broken, courtesy of a sniper who blew holes in the soldier's left leg and left hand. The wounds are so fresh that blood seeps through the bandages. He winces as he struggles to try to sit up before giving up and lying back down on the gurney. Staring up at the stained hospital ceiling, Hassan recounts the fierce firefight Wednesday on the streets of Ramadi that landed him here. Across the room, a border guard wounded in the battle for the al Qaim border crossing writhes in pain as doctors examine his legs, which are being held by metal rods rather than bone. In the corner, an Iraqi special forces soldier is wrapped in bandages from gunshot wounds he received in a firefight outside of Samarra.

Please answer the following question: White mountains are often visited by tourists because of the many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites and karst phenomena. Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which mountain has a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks? Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Answer:","completion":"White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks. Step 1: Understand the hint provided. The hint states that about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones and that the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes. Also, most cave systems are formed in limestone bedrock. Step 2: Analyze the information given about White mountains. The passage states that White mountains have many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena. Since karst landscapes and cave systems mainly form in limestone bedrock, it is likely that White mountains have a significant amount of sedimentary rocks, specifically limestones. Step 3: Analyze the information given about Dome mountains. The passage states that Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin, and excellent for climbing. There is no mention of sedimentary rocks, caves, or karst phenomena in the description of Dome mountains. Step 4: Compare the information and conclude. Based on the information provided, White mountains have cave systems and karst phenomena, which indicate the presence of sedimentary rocks like limestone. Dome mountains, on the other hand, are described as volcanic in origin and not linked to sedimentary rocks. Therefore, White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks compared to Dome mountains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I can use this background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Now, I have a new situation: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Answer this question please: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? The answer is:","completion":"Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As a specialist in montology (the study of mountains), Will's expertise primarily focuses on the formation, structure, and development of mountains. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, however, is an underwater oceanic feature primarily associated with the process of seafloor spreading and the formation of new oceanic crust. On the other hand, Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor - topics that are more directly relevant to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. His expertise in these areas would give him a deeper understanding of the processes, geology, and significance of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, compared to Will's knowledge of mountains and montology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis. I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS.

Help as much as you can. Information: - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Cuthbert Brodrick was a renowned English architect, born on September 1, 1821, in Kingston upon Hull, a vibrant maritime city in East Yorkshire, England. Throughout his career, he made significant contributions to Victorian architectural design, creating iconic buildings and leaving an extraordinary legacy in Britain. During his early years, Brodrick was exposed to the world of building and architecture through his family, as his father operated a successful building firm. His interest in the field blossomed as he aged, and Brodrick eventually decided to pursue a career in architecture. He moved to London in 1842, where he apprenticed under the tutelage of leading architect Henry Francis Lockwood. Under Lockwood's guidance, Brodrick honed his craft and gained a strong foundation in architectural design. After completing his apprenticeship, Brodrick returned to Yorkshire to establish his architectural practice. He quickly gained recognition for his innovative designs and exceptional craftsmanship, which reflected his unique amalgamation of classical and gothic architectural styles. Throughout his career, Brodrick designed numerous significant buildings, with many of them now considered to be important heritage sites. Among his most famous works is Leeds Town Hall, completed in 1858. During its construction, Brodrick encountered several challenges, including tight budgets and limited resources. Despite the difficulties, his ingenuity shined through, and he created a monumental town hall marked by a grand clock tower, a symbol of the city's prominence during the Industrial Revolution. Another one of his remarkable buildings was The Grand Hotel in Scarborough, completed in 1867. Boasting 365 rooms, the hotel served as a testament to the prosperity and optimism of the Victorian era. The design of the hotel, mirroring the Victorian penchant for opulence, included a striking central staircase, intricate ironwork, and lavish interior decorations. Sadly, Brodrick's later years saw a decline in demand for his architectural services, as public tastes and preferences moved away from the grandeur and formality of Victorian-era design. He lived a relatively modest life and frequently moved between Yorkshire and the south of England. In search of warmer climates due to his deteriorating health, Brodrick eventually settled in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands, located off the coast of Normandy, France. Cuthbert Brodrick passed away on March 2, 1905, in Jersey, leaving behind an enduring architectural legacy that continues to amaze and inspire generations of architects and enthusiasts. Today, many of his architectural masterpieces have been lovingly restored, ensuring that his innovative designs live on as treasures of British architectural history, and his extraordinary contributions to 19th-century architecture are commemorated through plaques, exhibitions, and historical celebrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: In the 2007 NFL Draft, the Jaguars used their first-round pick (21st overall) to select Florida safety Reggie Nelson. On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the teams final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the 2007–08 NFL playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the 2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated 2007 New England Patriots season; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars defense only once, on the first play. This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars front office a strong desire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.

Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci Is the King of Fashion Week Last Friday evening, a pier overlooking ground zero turned into the modern-day equivalent of “La Dolce Vita” when the Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci made his New York Fashion Week debut. Ostensibly, the show was about religion and the legacy of 9/11. But messages like that can become obscured when the impending arrival of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian holds up the proceedings for more than an hour. Nicki Minaj was there, looking in her leopard print dress like the incarnation of Jessica Rabbit. A few feet away was a more understated Julia Roberts, standing in her black tuxedo jacket and matching pants, with a dash of black eyeliner. Seated toward the back were Christina Ricci, Courtney Love, Deborah Harry, Amanda Seyfried, Jennifer Hudson and Erykah Badu. Even Pedro Almodóvar was in attendance, having come all the way from Madrid. And that was to say nothing of an older woman standing at the front gates professing to be a member of New York’s first family. “I don’t think we were expecting Governor Cuomo’s mother,” a member of Mr. Tisci’s staff said incredulously into his headset. “Make her show ID.” Ah, well. If you want to get into this designer’s club, there is a big line. Over the last decade, Mr. Tisci has slowly become the most socially connected fashion designer of his generation, a man whose tentacles extend from Oscar contenders to reality show participants, top-drawer artists to gay night-life promoters, barely legal models to surgically altered socialites. And his commitment to diversity has helped propel him to the top of his game not just with the usual crowd of (mostly) white editors and fashionistas, but also with a strikingly multicultural fan base. Ms. Badu and Victor Cruz have appeared in his ad campaigns. Jay Z and Beyoncé are on his speed dial (and were at his table at the Met Gala). And then there are vacation buddies like Madonna and Kate Moss, corporate collaborators like Nike (which recently hired Mr. Tisci to do a sneaker line), and a beaming boss named Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, who was seated this evening in the front row, looking pleased as punch at the event’s stellar turnout. Backstage was Marina Abramovic, the art director for the show, an endeavor she estimates took six months (those in the audience familiar with the cost of these productions said it was most likely one of the most expensive fashion shows New York had ever seen). But just how did this 41-year-old man with deep dark eyes, short black hair, a thick Italian accent and an inconspicuous uniform of black T-shirts, black shorts and black shoes win over all these glittery people? How did a man who just a decade ago was entirely unknown, a man whose debut collection was described by critics as “poorly organized and chaotic” (The New York Times), and “pretentious and “perplexing” (Style.com), come to this? Perhaps it was in the stars. In fashion, no method of self-exploration is more time-tested and industry approved than astrology. Mr. Tisci is a Leo, which is something he and his friends cite with remarkable frequency to explain his rise to the top of his profession. In Europe, his favorite horoscope comes from Fox in Italy. Here in New York, Mr. Tisci likes to visit a tarot card reader in Brooklyn. He was born on Aug. 1, 1974, in Taranto, a coastal city in southern Italy. In a family of moneyless Mediterraneans, he was the only boy, the youngest child of nine. When he was 6, his father died of a heart attack, but no one in his home wanted for love. To this day, his sisters are fixtures at his shows. Only recently, when his mother began to get frail, did she stop attending each of Givenchy’s runway shows. When she can’t be there (as she wasn’t on Friday), she rings his cellphone to ask if he has eaten, if he has slept, if he is alone. Invariably, the answers are the same: no, no and no. In school, Mr. Tisci was an outsider, the sort of child who worshiped gothic icons like Robert Smith and Siouxsie Sioux and was self-aware enough to begin plotting his escape from southern Italy. On-the-ground, around-the-clock dispatches from the spring 2016 shows, brought to you by the editors of Styles and T. “I knew if I stayed there, I would be poor forever,” Mr. Tisci said in June, sitting on a Le Corbusier sofa at the Givenchy headquarters in Paris, where he was smoking a cigarette in front of a large cactus. “My mom said: ‘Go. I am sure you will come back happier and stronger.’ ” And at 17, that’s what he did, heading off to London. There, he worked as a cleaner at a hotel and hung out at gay clubs like Trade, DTPM and Orange. He became an assistant to the designer Antonio Berardi, which led to a government grant enabling Mr. Tisci to attend Central Saint Martins, London’s most prestigious fashion school. It was brutal. Because he already had experience, Mr. Tisci was able to jump past the first year only to be treated by his fellow students like an interloper. “I was most hated,” said Mr. Tisci, whose heavily accented English is often too speedy for words like “a” and “the.” “They broke down my locker. It was like, ‘Welcome to fashion business!’ ” But it only made him work harder. “I am Leo,” he said. “I always have to give more.” In his senior year, Mr. Tisci began casting for his show and called upon a young model named Mariacarla Boscono to walk in it. When her agent said no, Mr. Tisci asked if she might be available simply to appear on the invitation. “He never gave up,” she said. And soon enough, he persuaded her representatives to let her do the shoot. She arrived at his loft, took the photo and never left his orbit. “What hit me most was that he could not stop,” Ms. Boscono said. “He was obsessed almost. Like van Gogh. Those psycho artists.” She, too, attributes his ferocious drive to his star sign — and her somewhat more laissez-faire demeanor to being a Virgo. “I’m a Virgo, but my rising sign is Scorpio,” Ms. Boscono said. “There are a lot of Virgos in the fashion business, but Virgos are introverted and tormented. Riccardo’s 100 percent Leo. You can’t be a Leo and be insecure. Not even when he was making clothes out of T-shirts.” Shortly thereafter, Mr. Tisci got a job at Ruffo Research, an Italian label that had previously given first jobs to future design stars like Nicolas Ghesquière and Sophia Kokosalaki. It went under before Mr. Tisci’s first show. In 2005, after the departure of Julien Macdonald, he was hired by Givenchy. Although it was a storied house founded in 1952 by Hubert de Givenchy, who gained fame dressing Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy, it had fallen on hard times. And Mr. Tisci bombed with his first collection. “It was a little too much gothic,” remembered Carine Roitfeld, then the editor of Paris Vogue, speaking by phone. “It was not so much success, but it was very much him. You could see he had talent.” And he quickly saw that celebrities would be valuable to him, even if he rejects the idea that this was the guiding principle behind his social machinations. “I don’t dress celebrities for the sake of dressing celebrities,” he insisted. “I dress people I like.” Among the first was Courtney Love, who was hired by Mr. Tisci to perform in 2007 at his atelier, in a white Stevie Nicks-meets-Catholic-Italian-housewife couture gown. Then, the stylist Arianne Phillips called and asked Mr. Tisci to send in some sketches for Madonna’s 2008 world tour, which led to a meeting with the diva, a job designing her black bedazzled costumes and, subsequently, a friendship. “I just stayed at her house in the Hamptons,” Mr. Tisci said during the visit in June. He became pals with Mr. West, who hired him to design the cover of his album collaboration with Jay Z (all gold embroidery, very Givenchy), then selected him to be a co-director for the rappers’ tour. Mr. West is a Gemini rather than a Leo, but Mr. Tisci has nothing but love for him, seeing in him a maverick, a punk-rock icon for a hip-hop age. In 2014, Mr. West and Ms. Kardashian called on Mr. Tisci to design outfits for their wedding, and he created a dress that later landed on the cover of Vogue. By this point, Givenchy’s skeptics in the news media had long since come around. LVMH, Givenchy’s parent company, increased the number of free-standing stores from around a dozen when he started to nearly 50. (The latest store in New York, which opened a few weeks ago, is its 57th free-standing location.) Retailers were increasing their orders. “It’s a growing business,” said Neiman Marcus’s Ken Downing, who said that the black leather handbags, sporty hip-hop-inspired men’s wear and heavily embellished women’s ready-to-wear are among Givenchy’s best sellers of late. And in January 2015, Mr. Tisci got another boost when Julianne Moore accepted her Golden Globe for best actress in a dark sleeveless metallic Givenchy dress. “Riccardo must have submitted at least 30 sketches, and the sketches were all exquisite,” Ms. Moore said. “It was difficult to winnow them down — so difficult that we ended up asking if it would be possible for him to make three dresses for me to choose from. Riccardo agreed, and when the dresses were ready, he came to my house in New York to fit me personally and help us make the decision. “Riccardo is very hands-on and is deeply insightful about each person that he dresses. He designs for the person, not just for the brand.” In the end, Ms. Moore took two, wearing the second to the Screen Actors Guild Awards. The third, Mr. Tisci tossed into the reject pile. It was “too romantic” for him, Ms. Moore said. Mr. Tisci is a pack animal. Nearly all the people in his circle, including Ms. Ricci and Amanda Lear, have a story about meeting another glittery person they never would have gotten to know were it not for him. One celebrity friend gets connected to Mr. Tisci via another celebrity friend, and then Mr. Tisci connects the newest entrants to his roving band of selfie-taking merrymakers. “I met Madonna, I met Alicia Keys through him,” Ms. Abramovic said. “Every time you are at his table, he makes sure there are models, artists, everything. He is a magnet.” When Mr. West became involved with Ms. Kardashian, Mr. Tisci introduced her to Ms. Roitfeld, who then put Ms. Kardashian on a 2013 cover of her magazine, CR Fashion Book. A reported ban on Ms. Kardashian at the annual Met Gala was lifted two years ago when Mr. Tisci hosted it with the fashion world’s supreme empress, Anna Wintour of Vogue. “In a way,” Ms. Wintour said, “Riccardo reminds me of Gianni Versace because he’s such an open, lovely person that people are drawn to him.” Mr. Tisci’s close friend Ladyfag, the night-life promoter, said: “He didn’t have a father growing up, so it’s interesting he’s become this patriarch for all these different people. It’s not planned out, but I do think there’s something to that.” Today, Mr. Tisci lives in a manner similar to that of his most glittery friends. He resides for the bulk of the year in Paris in a sun-drenched apartment overlooking the Seine amid Cindy Sherman and Robert Mapplethorpe photographs and Gio Ponti furniture. When not there, he jaunts around the globe with his leather Givenchy trolley full of black T-shirts and yellow American Spirit cigarettes. There are spring breaks in Rio with Ms. Moss and Ms. Campbell and summers in Ibiza with Mr. West and the fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. For a time, Mr. Tisci was making arrangements to live in New York with Ms. Abramovic, his industry mother, but that didn’t quite go according to plan. Sometime around 2011, they bought a townhouse in SoHo together. She was to take the two bottom floors, and he was to take the top three. “It has a garden and a pool,” he said. “In the middle of New York. I think this is very lucky.” So they renovated it, stocked it with more minimalist Italian furniture, and clinked glasses. But Mr. Tisci never moved in. “I’m always traveling,” he said. “I don’t have time!” After a year, Ms. Abramovic called him to say she was lonely. The house was huge, and he was never home. So she bought an apartment nearby and sold her two floors back to Mr. Tisci. He said he still hasn’t spent a night there, although his niece and nephew have and tell him it’s lovely. Where does he reside while in New York? “At the Mercer,” he said, letting out a laugh. For the record, the apartment is but a few blocks from his hotel. And he and Ms. Abramovic remain the best of friends. Money, in this instance, did not change everything. Like the celebrities he cavorts with, Riccardo Tisci has a schedule that no longer resembles a normal person’s. He is endlessly late and constantly rescheduling. A trip to New York scheduled for July was moved to August and then September. A meeting scheduled for Monday was moved to Tuesday, then Wednesday and finally Thursday. The afternoon before his fashion week show, on the third floor of the West Chelsea building where Givenchy had set up shop, people talked in hushed tones about how to say no to Riccardo. On the second floor, models mixed with seamstresses lurched over their sewing machines. Others hung out in a coffee area eating tarts and croissants. The mood was neither lazy nor to-the-bone, but instead like a film set, as work and pleasure bumped against each other, and everyone vacillated between looking captured and as if there was no better place in the world to be. As for Mr. Tisci, it perhaps makes sense that after spending a decade tending to the whims and unique scheduling patterns of rappers and movie stars, the ability to make people wait is now a luxury for him. It is a symbol both of having arrived and of — just as often — wanting not to be found. Indeed, sitting on his large black leather sofa in front of yet another large cactus, smoking yet another American Spirit later that afternoon, Mr. Tisci said his biggest desire was for the week to be over so he could go spend an anniversary with his boyfriend. One year, five years or 10? a reporter asked. “One month,” said Mr. Tisci, adding that they met in Ibiza. Forty-one years and much success have done little to change Mr. Tisci’s childlike demeanor. For one, he still bites his nails when he is nervous. For another, he does not so much sit in a chair but recline in it, as if he is constantly waiting for something, whether it is caffeine, American Spirits — or, more profoundly, inspiration. He is both a boy whose mama loved him a lot and a man determined to rebel against that. He’ll design a Victorian-inspired floor-length gown, then stick it on a transgender model named Lea T. He likes to call his most recent men’s wear collection “Jesus in Prison.” Last week, three male models showed up for a casting. Two had a cornfed Calvin Klein-pinup look, and a third seemed to have come straight out of a Larry Clark film: His skin was dark and ruddy; his hair had an orange tint. Mr. Tisci cast him immediately, and sent the other two men packing. His explanation? “Givenchy is supposed to be a little dangerous.” Recently, there’s been talk that Mr. Tisci may be on the way to somewhere bigger and better. His name was in heavy rotation when Frida Giannini was forced out at Gucci last year, and there was much chatter during fashion week that his show was not just an anniversary party but perhaps a farewell. Ms. Wintour is one person who would like to see him stay put. “I hope we see a little less musical chairs in fashion,” she said. “Givenchy is a great platform for him.” Mr. Tisci professes to agree. “In 10 years, a lot of people approach me,” he said. “When you make a house successful, people approach. But I always decline everything because I’m happy where I am. I want to concentrate on Givenchy.” Shortly after his fitting wrapped up, Mr. Tisci grabbed his American Spirits, chucked a handful of mixed nuts into his mouth and — with his publicist and one of the women in black — got into a Suburban and headed off to a rehearsal space with Ms. Abramovic. In Hell’s Kitchen, the car turned onto 53rd and Ninth, and Mr. Tisci looked out the window. “Where are we?” he asked the woman in black, as if there were not a street sign just in front of him. Upstairs in the rehearsal space a few minutes later, Ms. Abramovic was waiting with a handful of performers, who sang for Mr. Tisci in Hebrew, Arabic and Latin. Yet again he reclined in his chair, this time looking genuinely exhausted. After it was done, Ms. Abramovic walked out with him to the elevators. “We’re missing the Buddhist,” Ms. Abramovic said to him as they rode down to the street. “How many cars do you have?” “One,” said Mr. Tisci, indicating that there was space for her in it. Then, they bickered over the outfit of one of the performers. “You can’t do trousers,” she said. “He has to look a Turkish samurai.” “I think it should be simple,” he said, shaking his head. “Skirts are going to look strange.” It was raining. But Ms. Abramovic had seen the weather reports for the next day and felt optimistic. That’s what happens when people work with Riccardo Tisci. “God is on our side,” she said. “Today is raining, Saturday is going to be raining, Sunday is raining. And tomorrow is great? How do you explain it? It’s divine help.” Mr. Tisci agreed. “He is alive,” he said, referring to the big guy upstairs and maybe himself, too. And then he lit another cigarette, said goodbye to his publicist and headed off with Ms. Abramovic for what would indeed be 24 of the best hours of his professional life, complete with great weather and endless accolades from glittery friends.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who were the three people being shot at by Petey Willoughby? , can you please find it? Home from the Civil War, where he fought for the Union army, John Willoughby now lives in the western town of Kittreck Wells with wife Nora and their 7-year-old son, Petey. An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end. Meanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others. When they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days. That night, John finds the wandering horse bearing Gray's body and takes him home. Wesley lies to his father that Gray will meet them in the next town. Gray's horse wanders into town, where John and Nora remove the wounded man from the saddle and take him into their home. John is still determined to learn who killed the child, and an eyewitness accuses Gray of being one of the gang. Nora has to stop her husband from attacking Gray with an axe.","completion":"In the article, three people were being shot at by Petey Willoughby: Gray Mason, Frank Mason, and Wesley Mason.

On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister (concert master) of the Weimar Hofkapelle (court chapel) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. The position was created for him, possibly on his demand, giving him \\"a newly defined rank order\\" according to Christoph Wolff.From 1695, an arrangement shared the responsibility for church music at the Schlosskirche (court church) between the Kapellmeister Samuel Drese and the Vize-Kapellmeister Georg Christoph Strattner, who took care of one Sunday per month while the Kapellmeister served on three Sundays. The pattern probably continued from 1704, when Strattner was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm. When Konzertmeister Bach also assumed the principal responsibility for one cantata a month, the Kapellmeister's workload was further reduced to two Sundays per month.The performance venue on the third tier of the court church, in German called Himmelsburg (Heaven's Castle), has been described by Wolff as \\"congenial and intimate\\", calling for a small ensemble of singers and players. Performers of the cantatas were mainly the core group of the Hofkapelle, formed by seven singers, three leaders and five other instrumentalists. Additional players of the military band were available when needed, and also town musicians and singers of the gymnasium. Bach as the concertmaster probably led the performances as the first violinist, while the organ part was played by Bach's students such as Johann Martin Schubart and Johann Caspar Vogler. Even in settings like chamber music, Bach requested a strong continuo section with cello, bassoon and violone in addition to the keyboard instrument.

Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - A minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments. - The masenqo ( also spelled masenko , mesenqo , mesenko , masinko , or masinqo ) is a single - stringed bowed lute commonly found in the musical traditions of Ethiopia and Eritrea .

The lyres of Ur, excavated in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), date to 2500 BCE. The earliest picture of a lyre with seven strings appears in the famous sarcophagus of Hagia Triada (a Minoan settlement in Crete). The sarcophagus was used during the Mycenaean occupation of Crete (1400 BCE).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Flowing water causes sediment to move. Flowing water can erode both rocks and soil. You have already learned that materials can dissolve in water. With enough time, even rocks can be dissolved by water. This process happens really slowly. It may take over a million years to dissolve a rock. It doesnt matter how big the rock is. With enough time, flowing water can dissolve it. Moving water also has the ability to move small pieces of rock and soil. How can water move a rock? Doesnt it need energy? Of course, water gets its energy because it is moving. Moving water has kinetic energy. Things that have more energy can do more work. When water stops moving it will have no energy. It will no longer be able to move the rock and soil. When this happens the rock and soil will settle to the bottom of the calm water. Scientists call this process deposition. Question: \\"Does moving water have kinetic energy?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Is this answer correct? Possible answers: (a). no; (b). yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"(b). yes; Moving water indeed possesses kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and as water flows, it acquires energy due to its movement. The faster the water moves, the more kinetic energy it has, and the more work it can perform, such as eroding rocks and soil or transporting sediment. When water moves over the Earth's surface or through rivers and streams, it carries with it the energy to perform various tasks like dissolution, erosion, and deposition. This energy is derived from the force of gravity acting on the water, causing it to flow downhill, as well as the water's mass and velocity. As the water encounters rocks, soil, and other materials along its path, it transfers some of its kinetic energy to these materials, enabling it to wear them away, dissolve them, or carry them along with the flow. In the process of erosion, moving water can break down rocks and soil through direct contact and the abrasive action of sediment. Dissolution, on the other hand, occurs when certain minerals within the rocks are chemically broken down and dissolved into the water. Both of these processes can reshape the landscape over time and alter the components of the Earth's surface. Deposition is the process by which sediment and other materials suspended in the water are deposited when the water slows down or stops. As the kinetic energy of the water decreases, it becomes unable to carry the material any further, allowing it to settle to the bottom or along the edges of the water body. This process contributes to the formation of various geological features, such as sandbars, deltas, and other sedimentary deposits. In summary, moving water possesses kinetic energy due to its motion, which enables it to dissolve, erode, and transport materials, as well as deposit them when it loses energy or slows down. So the answer to the question \\"Does moving water have kinetic energy?\\" is (b) yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It can be tempting to use dirt from your yard or the same potting soil that you use outside; however, indoor plants have different needs than outdoor plants. Make sure that your soil is made for indoor plants because it will be lightly packed enough for the plants to grow while still tight enough to hold in the water.","completion":"Additionally, it is crucial to select the appropriate pot size and drainage system for your indoor plants. Choosing the right pot size allows for adequate root development and efficient nutrient absorption, enabling your plants to thrive and grow healthily. Pots with drainage holes at the bottom are highly recommended for preventing waterlogging and root rot, as they ensure excess water can escape, maintaining the right moisture balance in the soil. To further improve drainage, consider adding a layer of pebbles, coarse sand, or broken pieces of terracotta at the bottom of the pot.

University and government cybercrime or information security websites are good sources of information. For example, the Berkeley Department of Information Security and Policy has an archive of phishing messages available at https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phishing/phishing-examples-archive. You can also find news and information at https://www.antiphishing.org/, the official website of the Anti-Phishing Working Group. A legitimate email typically will have a specific subject line that gives you a basic understanding of what the email will say. Phishing emails, on the other hand, use vague phrases such as \\"Urgent Reminder\\" or \\"Your Account at Risk\\" to alarm you. Phishing email subject lines may also start with the abbreviation \\"Re:\\" to make you think the email is a response to an email you've sent. However, if you look at the email thread you can clearly see that there are no other emails. The subject line also may use special characters, emojis, or extra spaces. These don't serve any real purpose other than to draw your attention to the email by making the subject line look different from others in your inbox. Particularly if an email comes from a business, government agency, or other organization, the sender typically proofreads carefully before sending it. Obvious spelling and grammatical errors are a red flag that the email may not be legitimate. Also pay attention to the way language is used. Phishing emails frequently use words incorrectly or include awkward turns of phrase that no one would actually say. Scammers typically try to make the email address a phishing email is sent from look official or legitimate if you just glance at it. However, upon closer inspection, you'll note that something is amiss. Instead of ending in \\".com,\\" as it should, the email address may end differently. They may include \\"com\\" in the domain to fool you. For example, you might get a phishing email from \\"airbnbcom.work\\" instead of \\"airbnb.com.\\" It can take a second look to notice that odd extension. The company name may be spelled incorrectly, such as by having transposed letters or a single letter where there should be doubled letters. For example, you might get an email from \\"welsfargo.com\\" (attempting to impersonate the bank Well's Fargo). Phishing emails are desperate and insistent that the matter is urgent and you have a limited time to help or to correct a problem. Scammers want to raise a panic in you so that you give them your personal information without thinking. By the time you figure out that you've been scammed, it will be too late. Variations of this include \\"last reminder\\" emails. If you get an email claiming to be your \\"last reminder\\" of something and you never received any previous reminders, it's likely a phishing attempt. If the scammer is impersonating a friend or family member rather than a business or government agency, contact that person directly and ask if them about the email. Scammers often use copyright and trademark symbols to make their emails appear more official. However, business communications, such as emails, aren't entitled to copyright protection. A phishing email may include legitimate logos or other branding from the company or organization the scammer is trying to impersonate. They want to make their email look as believable as possible so you'll fall for the scam. Don't expect a scammer to respect intellectual property rights.","completion":"Phishing is when bad people try to trick you in emails. They want your private information, like passwords or credit card numbers. To spot a phishing email, look for strange subject lines, like \\"Urgent Reminder.\\" These emails might have bad spelling or weird words. Their email addresses may look almost right but have small mistakes. They might say it's super important and you need to act fast. Sometimes they use fake logos from real companies. If something seems off, don't trust the email. Be careful and stay safe online."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What is Costa Rica? Question 2: What is Costa Rica known for? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What is Costa Rica? Costa Rica is a country located in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the northeast, Panama to the southeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. It has a total area of 51,100 square kilometers (19,700 square miles) and a population of approximately 5 million people. Costa Rica is a democratic and peaceful country, having abolished its army in December 1948. The official language is Spanish, and the currency is the Costa Rican Colon. The country is divided into seven provinces: San Jose, Alajuela, Cartago, Heredia, Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste. The capital city is San Jose, which is located in the San Jose Province. Costa Rica has a tropical climate, with distinctive wet and dry seasons, and boasts a rich biodiversity. This small nation is home to nearly 6% of the world's total species. Question 2: What is Costa Rica known for? Costa Rica is known for several distinct features: 1. Biodiversity: Costa Rica contains an extraordinary amount of flora and fauna. This rich biodiversity is due to its numerous ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, cloud forests, dry forests, mangroves, and coral reefs. The country is home to over 500,000 species, making it one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. 2. Ecotourism: As a result of its incredible biodiversity, Costa Rica has become a popular ecotourism destination. Tourists from around the world flock to the country to enjoy activities such as wildlife spotting, hiking, birdwatching, and exploring the natural landscapes. It is estimated that around 300,000 tourists visit Costa Rica each year specifically for ecotourism purposes. 3. Conservation policies: Costa Rica has made significant efforts in environmental conservation, protecting more than 25% of its territory through national parks, reserves, and refuges. The government has also set ambitious goals for carbon neutrality and renewable energy use. 4. Coffee production: Costa Rica is known for producing high-quality coffee, which is one of its major exports. The country's volcanic and fertile soil, combined with its unique microclimates, creates the perfect conditions for growing coffee beans. 5. Adventure activities: Costa Rica is known for its wide range of adventure activities, such as zip-lining, white-water rafting, surfing, and canopy tours. These activities attract adventure-seekers from around the world. 6. Pura Vida lifestyle: The phrase \\"Pura Vida\\" is synonymous with the Costa Rican way of life. It can be translated as \\"simple life\\" or \\"pure life\\", and embodies the country's laid-back, friendly atmosphere and focus on appreciating the simple things in life. In conclusion, while Questions 1 and 2 are related, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 asks for a more general overview of Costa Rica as a country, including its geographical, political, and cultural characteristics. Question 2, on the other hand, inquires about the distinguishing aspects and prominent features of Costa Rica."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How is \\"The same goes for fiscal incentives.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the phrase \\"The same goes for fiscal incentives.\\" can be translated as \\"Sama pätee myös verotuksellisiin kannustimiin.\\" To elaborate a bit on the Finnish language: Finnish, or suomi, is a Uralic language and is closely related to Estonian and a bit further afield to Hungarian. It's spoken by about 5.4 million people, primarily in Finland. One of its unique features is vowel harmony, which means that the vowels present in a word must belong to one of the two classes - either back or front. In regards to the translation above, here's how it breaks down: 'Sama' translates to 'the same' in English. This shows an agreement or similarity with the something previously mentioned. This word agrees with the subject it refers to in number, making Finnish a language with rich morphology. 'Pätee' is a verb that means 'applies' or 'goes' in this context. Finnish verbs are conjugated according to mood, tense, voice, and person. Different endings are attached to the verb stem to indicate different meanings. 'Myös' is an adverb that's equivalent to 'also' in English. Finnish adverbs describe how, when, where, or why an action is performed. They don't change for plurals or cases, which is one of the easier aspects of Finnish. 'Verotuksellisiin' is an adjective derived from the noun 'verotus', which means 'taxation'. The suffix '-ellisiin' is the illative case (a Finnish locative case) of the plural form of the adjective 'verotuksellinen', translating to 'fiscal'. 'Kannustimiin' is the illative, plural form of the noun 'kannustin', which translates to 'incentive'. Finnish noun and adjective inflection involves the addition of various suffixes to the stem to express different grammatical relations such as case. Therefore, when combined, \\"Sama pätee myös verotuksellisiin kannustimiin\\" is a direct translation of \\"The same goes for fiscal incentives\\" in Finnish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac (JosÃ© Ferrer) stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury (Arthur Blake). An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her. Cyrano befriends the young man and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her. To help him, Cyrano composes Christian's love letters to Roxane, which she finds irresistible. Later, Christian decides he wants no... My question: Who is the pastry chef ?

Please answer the following question: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Neptune have slower or faster speed than Earth? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: A:","completion":"Neptune would have a slower speed than Earth. Based on the provided information and according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the farther a planet is from its star (in this case, the Sun), the longer the distance it must travel, and the slower its speed, because it is less affected by the star's gravity. Since Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, it takes a longer time to complete one revolution around the Sun compared to Earth, which is closer to the Sun. This results in a slower orbital speed for Neptune. Additionally, as a planet approaches its closest point to the star (periastron or perihelion), its speed increases due to the exchange of gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy. Conversely, as the planet moves to its farthest point (apastron or aphelion), its speed decreases. In summary, Neptune's greater distance from the Sun results in a slower orbital speed compared to Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bananas Context: Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) is the protagonist, but he does not appear until after the opening credits. The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional \\"banana republic\\" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4] Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President. When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. Mellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated. Like the opening scene, it was accompanied by Cosell providing commentary.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine. He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \\"She Loves You\\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February; he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\".In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \\"Lucy\\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \\"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! is George. George Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The 2016 Rio Olympic Games have come to an end. Without doubt, many Chinese sports fans sat in front of the TV and cheered our athletes on, hoping that they would get as many gold medals as possible. But sometimes our desire for gold medals can result in the sadness of failure. When Liu Xiang, China's track hero, pulled out of the Beijing Olympics due to injury, he greatly disappointed many Chinese sports fans. But things are different now. In the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, we saw a healthier and more _ Chinese attitude toward the sportspeople, fully in line with the Olympic spirit. China didn't win any gold medals on the first day. But, instead of criticizing the athletes who failed to finish on top of the podium , the majority of fans were happy with their efforts. \\"Reacting in the right way when an athlete misses out on gold shows the maturity of a person, and is also a challenge for a country to face up to in the process of development,\\" commented CRI. Swimmer Fu Yuanhui won fans' hearts, even if she only won a bronze medal in the 100m backstroke final. Her fans on her Sina Weibo micro blog have increased 100,000 to over 6 million. Many sports fans appreciated her straightforward character and attitude toward competition. \\"The warm support from Internet users shows that public attitude toward competitive sport and the Olympics have gotten to a higher level,\\" said an article in the People's Daily.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Another term for it is \\"relationship addiction\\". People form and persist with relationships \\"that are one-sided, emotionally destructive and/or abusive\\". Sitting in the atrium of Trump Tower on Tuesday, as Donald Trump harangued the press - well, you know where I'm going. For all the abuse, for all the belittlement, we as reporters show no sign of ending our relationship addiction with Donald Trump. Much of our cravenness is easily explained. It stems from the record-breaking television ratings that Trump has generated and, just as important these days, millions of online hits. A human headline, he more than satisfies the viral requirements of our new media age. At a time when media organisations are struggling still to monetise online news content, and to make the painful shift from print to digital, along comes the ultimate clickbait candidate, a layer of golden eggs. Understandably, hard-pressed news executives are echoing the words reportedly uttered by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, at her Brooklyn headquarters: \\"I've got to get me some Trump.\\" It has meant that the default setting for cable news channels here is a split screen showing an empty Trump lectern on one side with pundits on the other, bloviating endlessly as they await the billionaire's arrival. As for a Trump news conference, it is rather like broadcasting one of those freeway police chases filmed from a helicopter: car crash television that you want to stay with until the end - though perhaps the more accurate analogy is of security camera footage that captures a street fighter who has no qualms about reaching for the broken bottle. It is unedifying, gruesome even, but also utterly compelling. It explains why none of the news channels cut away from the Trump news conference yesterday, even as it degenerated into a one-way slanging match. Or why none of the reporters present, myself included, simply got up and walked out. Yet the media's Trump relationship addiction is not explained by commercial imperatives alone. Political reporters have a tendency of writing a campaign narrative that comports with the race they ideally want to cover. It's not an invented narrative, as such - we can't simply make up storylines. But I would suggest it's a slanted narrative, which, rather than betraying a liberal bias, reveals a \\"great story\\" bias. In a reworking of the old newsroom adage \\"if it bleeds, it leads\\", candidates tend to be assessed on the basis of their journalistic entertainment value. My sense, while covering the 2000 campaign for instance, was that reporters handicapped the race in favour of George W. Bush because the possibility of a son following his father into the White House, with all the oedipal complexity that went with it, was a better story than seeing Al Gore become president. That would have felt like a Clinton third term, absent its charismatic leading man. This tendency was even more pronounced in 2008, during the Democratic primary campaign, when journalists were more excited by the prospect of the first African-American president than the first female president, Hillary Clinton. Everyone wanted to compose their own first draft of that dramatic historical moment. Trump is also a beneficiary of great story bias. Never before has there been a candidate with such journalistic entertainment value. His unexpected emergence meant that we ditched our initial narrative of Campaign 2016, which we had set up a dynastic showdown between a Bush and a Clinton, in favour of a better storyline. The media didn't create Donald Trump, the basis of the ever more fashionable \\"Frankenstein's monster\\" critique of the press. But we have been more willing enablers than we would care to admit. So while there has been no shortage of critical coverage of Donald Trump, there has been a reluctance to go for his jugular. This tendency is most noticeable in broadcast interviews. Jake Tapper's interview with Donald Trump, in which the billionaire failed to disavow support from white supremacists and said he needed to do more research on the Ku Klux Klan before condemning it, offered a case in point. Tapper, who has done some excellent interviews during this campaign, was tough and probing but did not go in for the kill. An obvious follow-up question would have been \\"do you really need to do more research on the KKK to condemn it\\" but he did not ask it. As for the interview between Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump, it provides the textbook case study of campaign co-dependency. Kelly rocked Trump in a televised debate last year, with a brilliant and legitimate line of questioning about his misogyny. But when she sat down with him at Trump Tower for a prime time special, and talked about his hate-Tweeting, she described how she imagined him doing it wearing \\"a crushed velvet smoking jacket, chaise lounge, slippers\\". Jon Sopel, my colleague and compatriot, wrote a terrific blog on the Trump press conference, observing: \\"The remarkable thing that has struck me as a British correspondent living in Washington, and who is used to a robust relationship between journalist and politician, is how Trump has been treated with kid gloves.\\" I could not agree more. The preference in American broadcast journalism is to end interviews on amicable terms. There is not the adversarial tradition of British interviewing, nor a US equivalent of John Humphrys or Jeremy Paxman. Bikers reveal sickly choice for US voters Trump: Illegals treated better than vets What's also striking is that we as journalists do not have the power of old. Trump and other candidates have used Twitter especially, not only to bypass the media but also to become part of the new media themselves. The billionaire's Twitter account has more followers - 8.5 million - than the Washington Post, ABC News, NBC News, the Huffington Post or Buzzfeed. He has become a self-publisher, and provided an unfiltered commentary of his own. Trump's strength is a measure of the mainstream media's weakness. That imbalance was evident at the news conference in Trump Tower. He possessed the only microphone. He could drown out every reporter. He controlled who asked the questions, and probably half of the journalists present did not get the chance to do so. Ever the shrewd media operator, he also knew that the cable news channels would stay with it until the end. For another illustration of our comparative powerlessness, just witness the number of stories that have been written about Trump, which in an ordinary election cycle would have been disqualifying - his misogyny, his racism, his incitement of supporters to punch protesters in the face, his cussing, his refusal to release his tax returns, his constant flip-flopping on policy, Trump University, etc, etc. Much has been written about how Trump defies the usual laws of political gravity, but one of the reasons is that modern-day media organisations lack orbital pull. The Trump obsession has affected our coverage in subtler ways, too. Had it not been for our fixation with the Republican contest, we would have paid more attention to Bernie Sanders' extraordinary success. Yet we've downplayed that storyline. This is partly for valid analytical reasons. Early on, it became clear that Hillary Clinton was winning the all-important \\"black vote\\" - this race has proven again that it is all but impossible to win the Democratic nomination without it - and had the support of so many super-delegates that her lead became insurmountable. But I wonder whether another explanation for short-changing Sanders goes to how Trump has impacted our professional pride. We can cope with being proven spectacularly wrong in one race, the Republican contest, but not two. Absent Trump, journalists would have felt the Bern far more strongly, because it would have been the best storyline on offer. Again, it demonstrates how we as journalists tend to talk up certain narratives and talk down others, of how we are prone to great story bias. Confessedly, I hated being at that Trump news conference, most of which I spent with my arm thrust skyward trying unsuccessfully to ask a question. But I also admit to being enthralled by the most extraordinary election campaign I have ever covered. Like every other journalist, I dare say I'll be back the next time he summons us to Trump Tower. Perhaps, if he continues to be so personally abusive, journalists should stage a walkout. That said, I suspect we'll remain planted in our seats, sufferers of co-dependency, fellow Trump relationship addicts.

The piano is very heavy and unfortunately he isn't strong enough to lift it up his front steps. A friend of his suggests he get a ramp since it will support part of the weight allowing him to push it into his house much easier. Adam gets the ramp and successfully pushes the piano in to his new house. and a hint : The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. On the other hand, the output force is greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance. Like other simple machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is given by Please answer this question : Will Adam have an easier time lifting a heavy refrigerator into his new house or pushing it up a ramp? A:","completion":"Adam will have an easier time pushing the heavy refrigerator up a ramp, just like he did with the piano. Using a ramp (an inclined plane) reduces the amount of force required to move the object uphill, as it distributes the weight of the object over a greater distance.

Four days after the events of Rush Hour, LAPD Detective James Carter is on vacation in Hong Kong visiting his friend, Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee, whom he met and befriended after working together to save the Chinese Consul Han's daughter, Soo Yung, in Los Angeles. Their leisure is temporarily put on hold as soon as a bomb explodes at the United States Consulate General, murdering two undercover U.S. Customs agents inside of it. Inspector Lee is assigned to the case, which becomes personal when it is discovered that it somehow involves Ricky Tan, his late police officer father's former partner. Ricky, who was suspected of having a role in elder Lee's death (although never proven), is now a leader of the Triads. This, however, causes Lee and Carter to get into a brawl between them and Ricky's bodyguards, with Carter becoming shocked with Lee as they were busy with their vacation. The U.S. Secret Service, led by Agent Sterling, and the Hong Kong Police Force soon get into a fight over the jurisdiction of the case.

Douglas Clare Fischer (October 22, 1928 - January 26, 2012) was an American keyboardist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. After graduating from Michigan State University (from which, five decades later, he would receive an honorary doctorate), he became the pianist and arranger for the vocal group the Hi-Lo's in the late 1950s. Fischer went on to work with Donald Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie, and became known for his Latin and bossa nova recordings in the 1960s. He composed the Latin jazz standard \\"Morning\\", and the jazz standard \\"Pensativa\\". Fischer next lived in Detroit, Michigan, whereupon, after first hearing the vocal quartet The Hi-Lo's in a live performance, he promptly offered his services. Over the next five years, Fischer recorded several albums with the group, serving as pianist and, on occasion, arranger. In addition, he contributed several vocal arrangements, making his debut in that capacity; it was these arrangements that Herbie Hancock would later point to as a major influence: [T]hat's when I really learned some much farther-out voicings - like the harmonies I used on Speak Like a Child - just being able to do that. I really got that from Clare Fischer's arrangements for the Hi-Lo's. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept... I heard some of his last records, and he was still doing amazing harmonic stuff. And, of course, he was a wonderful pianist, too. But it was those vocal harmonies that were the first thing I heard. I was in awe of him. When Fischer moved to Hollywood in 1958, he went to East L.A. to play and learn more about Latin-Jazz. He started in a charanga group with Modesto Duran as leader and played with many different groups. On November 2, 1959, he made a particularly fruitful connection within this genre when he appeared with the Hi-lo's at the First Annual Los Angeles Jazz Festival on the same bill with the already popular Latin jazz group led by vibraphonist Cal Tjader. Both his playing and arranging made an immediate impression on Tjader, who went on to employ Fischer in both capacities on several recordings over the next three years; the two would reunite in the mid-seventies, leading eventually to the formation of Fischer's own Latin jazz unit, Salsa Picante. In 1961, Fischer became interested in Brazilian music through the recordings of Elizete Cardoso and Joao Gilberto. This discovery, coupled with his introduction to the music of Mexican composer Mario Ruiz Armengol, led to Fischer's subsequent collaboration with Cal Tjader, a 1962 LP devoted jointly to Armengol's music and that of assorted contemporary Brazilian composers. Over the following year, Fischer collaborated on two Bossa Nova-themed LPs with saxophonist Bud Shank, and arranged another for pianist George Shearing. While with The Hi-Lo's, Fischer arranged a record by trumpeter Donald Byrd, which, by virtue of Fischer's use of strings and harps, imbued well-known standards with an unaccustomed, melancholic quality. Although it would be twenty-five years before the album was finally released, September Afternoon paid immediate dividends when Byrd played a copy for Dizzy Gillespie. In turn, Gillespie hired Fischer to write arrangements for a small ensemble featuring brass and woodwinds for his own album, A Portrait of Duke Ellington, which was well received. In 1960 albums for vibraphonist Cal Tjader and pianist George Shearing followed, as did an eight-year career of writing music for commercials, as well as the signing of Fischer's first record contract.","completion":"This text is about Douglas Clare Fischer, an American keyboardist, composer, arranger, and bandleader.

Paraphrases typically restate the same idea in different words or with slight changes in structure, while maintaining the same meaning. In this case, there is a subtle difference in meaning due to the verb tense. Conclusion: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because the difference in verb tense creates a slight difference in meaning. However, they are very similar in terms of overall content and idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

MIT injecting life into Kendall Square For all of its success as a center of commerce, Kendall Square in Cambridge remains something of an urban desert, with unused spaces and buildings isolated by wide streets, exaggerating the sense of emptiness. But that may soon change. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is preparing to spend 700 million to redevelop eight of its properties in Kendall Square, adding to the transformation of what is largely a commercial zone to a more pedestrian-friendly, lively neighborhood where people would live as well as work. “MIT’s proposed new development has the potential to transform Kendall Square into a vibrant dynamic place where the activity at the ground is as cutting-edge as the science above,’’ said Cambridge’s city manager, Robert Healy. MIT officials expect to submit a revised plan to Cambridge officials within a month or so, after gathering reaction from neighbors and city planners. Construction on some of the first buildings could be finished within two or three years of getting permits, they said. The university’s plans add to an already robust construction scene around Kendall Square, with 5 million square feet of lab and office space underway or under consideration. The new buildings, valued at more than 2 billion, would host operations for some of the pharmaceutical industry’s leading companies. Meanwhile, Cambridge itself is in the midst of broader development review that is also looking at other underutilized spaces throughout Kendall Square, as well as in nearby Central Square and along the section of Main Street that connects the two. City officials hope this will prompt other developers to follow MIT’s lead and add buildings with a range of activities that would contribute to a lively street life. MIT’s plan echoes that of Harvard University, which is launching a massive build-out across the Charles River in North Allston. In addition to school-related buildings, Harvard is trying to replicate the success of the current Kendall Square by developing a 36-acre “enterprise research campus’’ that will include as many as 12 commercial and academic buildings aimed at attracting private companies. In Kendall Square, most of MIT’s work would be around the lower Main Street corridor near the MBTA Red Line station. The construction plan calls for about 1.1 million square feet of new space at eight locations in Kendall Square, including two large office, lab, and retail buildings along Main Street. Other facilities would be built on parking lots just south of Main Street and near MIT’s One Broadway office building by Memorial Drive. MIT is also proposing to create an outdoor plaza at the Kendall Square T Station and to make extensive “streetscape’’ improvements, such as with benches, trees, and streetlights. The university’s managing director of real estate, Steve Marsh, said MIT’s overall goal is to “knit the Kendall Square community together.’’ But nearby residents complain that the major shortcoming of MIT’s plan is that it does not call for enough housing. The original proposal included about 120 housing units, which current residents said is not nearly enough to transform Kendall from a commuter zone. “We don’t want a 9-to-5 Kendall Square,’’ said Barbara Broussard, president of the East Cambridge Planning Team, a community group. MIT, she argued, is too focused on commercial development rather than on building a true mixed-used neighborhood with bustling shops and housing. “We’re very opposed to the idea as it is now,’’ she said. “They’re not giving anything to the community.’’ Cambridge officials said they are also pressing MIT to add more housing to its plans. Assistant City Manager Brian Murphy, Cambridge’s point person on MIT’s build-out, said the university has to build “significantly more’’ than the 120,000 square feet of housing it has proposed, slated for a surface lot next to One Broadway. MIT is now looking to add more housing to its plans, said Marsh, the real estate executive, as well as what he termed “funky retail’’ components that would answer the city’s and residents’ desire to avoid filling the area with chain stores. Recently there has been some housing and retail added to the area, particularly along Third Street. One study conducted for MIT suggested putting even more housing and restaurants along Third Street, though those are not part of MIT’s current development plan before the City of Cambridge. A number of efforts are underway that could turn Kendall Square in Cambridge into a livelier neighborhood with more restaurants, shops, and places to live. The Kendall Square Initiative itself is part of a much-larger 20-year capital plan by MIT to make major building and infrastructure improvements across the university’s sprawling campus. It also includes at least two new on-campus buildings dedicated to energy, environmental, and materials research, according to preliminary plans. Over the years, MIT has been instrumental in making Kendall Square a mecca for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Last week, ground was broken on a 230,000-square-foot building on MIT-owned land at 610 Main St. that will house research operations for Pfizer Inc., the giant pharmaceutical company. MIT is also working with Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and other companies on building office and research facilities on university land elsewhere in Cambridge. Other large property owners are undertaking ambitious expansions, too, including a 500 million complex of seven buildings by Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. and several buildings by Boston Properties. The goal of the larger Kendall-Central squares initiative by the city is to establish long-term commercial, retail, and housing priorities on both MIT and other privately owned properties in those areas, city officials say. The study is being conducted by Goody Clancy, a Boston architectural and urban-design firm, and is expected to be completed in March. Healy said the goal is to strengthen the city’s “innovation economy’’ and give the area a more bustling neighborhood feel. “This is a terrific opportunity to increase the activity near and surrounding Kendall Square,’’ he said. Other businesses in the area worry that MIT’s ambitious plan will be delayed if the zoning review is bogged down by drawn-out negotiations. “Kendall Square is now the ‘it’ place for innovation,’’ said Travis McCready, executive director of the Kendall Square Association, a business group. “Everyone wants to be there. But you have to strike while the iron is hot.’’ Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"MIT plans to invest 700 million to redevelop eight of its properties in Kendall Square, Cambridge, with the aim of transforming the area into a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood where people can live and work.

The youth is a skilled but violent warrior, who his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. Thousands of years ago, the Mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, which were scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask, and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge. Years later, Conan has become a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it, killing all of the slave handlers in the process. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by a man whom Conan recognizes as Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the body of the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the rest of the prisoners to escape, and, in gratitude, Ela-Shan tells Conan that, if he ever needs him, Conan will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is then killed by the prisoners. Zym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery where they hope to find the pure-blood descendant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"An underwater earthquake can affect ocean waves and the overall process you mentioned, but its impact would be considered indirect. Here's an analysis of the process after an underwater earthquake has occurred: 1. If an underwater earthquake happens, it could cause a sudden movement of the seafloor, potentially generating stronger and larger ocean waves called tsunamis. These waves could impact the coastal areas with more force than regular ocean waves. 2. Due to the increased force of tsunami waves, the capabilities of these waves to pull sand and erode beaches may become more significant compared to regular ocean waves. Erosion and sediment transport processes could be intensified, which could lead to more noticeable changes to the coastal landscape. 3. Similarly, stronger waves could cause more substantial damage to rocks and cliffs along the coast, breaking off larger pieces and accelerating coastal erosion. 4. The transport of sand and rocks into the ocean would also be affected, as the stronger waves could move more sediment and larger rocks into deeper water or even to other coastal regions. 5. As a result, the deposition of sand and rocks at new locations or the bottom of the ocean would be influenced by the powerful tsunami waves created by the underwater earthquake. In summary, an underwater earthquake indirectly impacts the steps of the process. Although it does not directly change the mechanism of each step, it affects the overall process by increasing the magnitude and intensity of the ocean waves, which in turn, impacts the coastal erosion, transport, and deposition processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We were in a Hampton Inn last night and I don’t know where we are tonight. “Different hotel in different nights, and sometimes you don’t sleep so well,” Romney explained, before launching into a story about truck drivers who kept him up all night in Muscatine, Iowa, when they saw his campaign bus parked right off the interstate. “Every now and then the drivers liked me, and would pull the horn so we had trouble sleeping. There are times it’s hard,” Romney said. “But the best part of the campaign is doing what I’m doing now. It’s meeting people across the country and shaking hands and making friends. “The measure of a person’s life is not how much stuff they have … [it's how] many people they love, how many friends they have. It’s the personal connections between people, family and friends that really measure what kind of life you’ll enjoy,” Romney said. “So getting to run for president has been the greatest opportunity I’ve ever had to expand the world of my friendships and people I love and care for. “So, if you get the chance to do it, make sure you do it,” he told the boy. “Win or lose, it’s a great thing to do.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about an interaction between Mitt Romney, a former GOP (Republican) presidential candidate, and an eight-year-old boy named Ben Navratil during a campaign event in Mason City, Iowa.

Here is a news article: BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - A 10-year-old boy who died today after he and several of his family members were trapped under a fallen flight information sign at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport is being remembered tonight as a boy full of life and love. \\"He was a beautiful boy,'' said his uncle, Alex Bresette. \\"He was great in school. He was bright and inquisitive.\\" Luke Bresette was fatally injured about 1:30 p.m. today as he and his three brothers, sister and parents were returning to Overland Park, Kansas after spending a week in Destin for Spring Break. A display sign weighing an estimated 300-400 pounds peeled away from the wall at the newly-renovated airport, falling on Luke, his mother Heather Bresette, and brothers Sam, 8, and Tyler, 5. Husband and father Ryan Bresette wasn't injured, nor was sister Anna and another brother, Joe, Alex Bresette said. Heather Bresette is listed in critical condition at UAB Hospital with two broken ankles and a fractured pelvis. She underwent surgery this evening, Alex Bresette said. Sam is being treated for a broken leg and nose; Tyler for a concussion. Both are listed in serious condition at Children's of Alabama. Authorities had said four children were hospitalized in the incident, but Alex Bresette said only three, and hospital officials said the same. The grieving uncle told AL.com tonight that Luke, the third of the five children, was an active 5th grader at St. Thomas More School, where all five of the Bresette children have been attending this year. He played baseball, football, basketball and sang in the choir. He was an avid fan of Notre Dame football, and the Kansas Jayhawks. \\"You know how some kids get too old to hug you anymore?\\" Alex Bresette said. \\"Not Luke, he always hugged.\\" Witnesses said the family was walking by the giant sign when it came crashing down on top of them. It took six men to lift the sign off the family, and later about a dozen men held it up while rescue workers worked on the family. That portion of the airport was cordoned off this afternoon, and an investigation is now underway into what went terribly wrong. Alex Bresette described the ordeal as unfathomable and horrifying. He said the family has seen an outpouring of love this evening. \\"We are incredibly sad,\\" he said, \\"but so appreciative of the support we've received.\\" Follow @alcombirmingham ||||| A woman and two of her sons were improving at hospitals on Sunday after they were seriously injured when a flight information billboard fell on them at an airport. A third son was killed Friday when the electronic board, weighing at least 300 pounds (135 kilograms), fell at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. The boys' mother, Heather Bresette, had broken ankles and a crushed pelvis. She had surgeries over the weekend and was getting better, University Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Wyatt said. However, she was still in intensive care and unconscious. \\"She does not know that her baby is dead,\\" said the family's priest, the Rev. Don Farnan. The Bresettes, a family of seven, took a weeklong vacation in Destin, Florida., and were about to fly home to Overland Park, Kansas, when the sign fell. Luke Bresette, 10, was killed. His brother, 5-year-old Tyler, suffered a concussion but was expected to be released from a children's hospital. His 8-year-old brother, Sam, had a broken leg and nose. Luke was the middle child of the five. The father, Ryan Bresette, and another son and daughter, were at the airport but not injured. During their vacation, the family swam in the Gulf of Mexico and Luke went parasailing for the first time. \\"His dad said he was thrilled. He was an adventurous kid. He loved sports,\\" said Farnan, a priest at St. Thomas More in Kansas City, Missouri. After the sign fell, it took six people to lift the large board and a dozen people to hold it up while first responders administered aid. Officials were investigating how the sign fell at the newly renovated airport and took down an identical billboard on Saturday. The renovated concourse opened March 13. It was part of an ongoing 200 million upgrade of Birmingham's airport. The construction began in June 2011 and is being overseen by Brasfield & Gorrie Global Services Group. The Birmingham-based company said in a statement it was working with airport authorities to determine why the sign fell. \\"This is a terrible tragedy that none of us fully understand, and we hope that the family who lost their loved one will find strength through prayer and the support of all of us,\\" the statement said. Ryan Bresette said in a message on Facebook that words cannot describe the pain the family feels. In a note to his son, he wrote, \\"I miss and love Luke so very much. I love you Luke!\\" \\"Ryan is especially grateful for the amazing support of the people in Birmingham. They even started a fund for the family at a bank there,\\" Farnan said. \\"There are long, loving arms that stretch between Birmingham and Kansas City.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A 10-year-old boy, Luke Bresette, was tragically killed and several family members were injured after a 300-400 pound flight information sign fell on them at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport.

Carmen Díez De Rivera pyysi kuitenkin kiinnittämään huomiota Doñanan katastrofiin, mikä oli luonnollista. Translate to English English:","completion":"Carmen Díez De Rivera, however, asked to pay attention to the Doñana disaster, which was natural. Carmen Díez De Rivera, a concerned individual or perhaps an environmental activist, called for increased attention and focus on the Doñana disaster. This event was a significant ecological catastrophe that impacted the environment, biodiversity, and the surrounding communities. The term \\"natural\\" in this context suggests that it was expected or entirely reasonable for this person to raise awareness about the disaster due to the severity of its consequences and potential harm to the ecosystem. The Doñana disaster likely refers to the Aznalcóllar mine spill that occurred in Spain on April 25, 1998, near Doñana National Park. A containment dam at the Los Frailes mine failed, resulting in the release of approximately 5 million cubic meters of acidic mine tailings, which contained toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. These poisonous substances flowed into the nearby Guadiamar River, causing widespread damage to the environment, including the destruction of aquatic life, contamination of water sources, and harm to the park's flora and fauna. Doñana National Park is one of Europe's most important protected natural areas, home to a diverse range of ecosystems and species. The park, located in the Spanish provinces of Huelva, Cádiz, and Seville, comprises marshlands, dunes, and Mediterranean forests that support various plant and animal species, some of which are endangered. Thus, raising awareness about the Doñana disaster is crucial to preserve and protect this invaluable ecological region from further damage. Carmen Díez De Rivera's request to focus on the Doñana disaster sheds light on the critical need for adequate environmental management and oversight. Addressing such environmental catastrophes requires a comprehensive approach that involves remediation efforts, strict regulations to monitor industrial activities near fragile ecosystems, and an ongoing commitment to protect the environment on a local, national, and global scale. In summary, Carmen Díez De Rivera's call to pay attention to the Doñana disaster highlights the importance of recognizing, addressing, and preventing environmental catastrophes that can cause long-lasting damage to ecosystems and the species that depend on them. This type of catastrophe serves as a reminder of our collective responsibility to protect and preserve the natural world and seek sustainable solutions to the challenges posed by human activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Le mariage de Figaro va ser la segona de les seves tres obres teatrals sobre el comte d'Almaviva i el seu servent, el barber Figaro. La primera, Le barbier de Séville, ou la précaution inutile (1775), tracta sobre l'il·lícit encalç per part del noble espanyol de Rosina, pupil·la del doctor Bartolo. Tant Giovanni Paisiello com, més tard, Rossini van fer sengles òperes bufes que s'hi basaven. Le mariage de Figaro ou la folle journée (1784) passa tres anys després, quan el comte ha posat els ulls sobre ni més ni menys que en la promesa de Figaro, Susanna, qui és al servei de la comtessa. L'última obra de la trilogia de Figaro, L'autre Tartuffe, ou La mère coupable (1792), tracta dels amors de la comtessa amb un patge, Cherubino, de qui tindrà un fill il·legítim.[10] Question: De què va ser titllada Le mariage de Figaro?

There are beautiful beaches, adventure parks, nature parks and so much more. There are so many sights to see here. It is a pity to drive in a car and you'll miss a great part of it. Australia is home to many animals and birds that can only be seen when moving slowly and going into the areas that they live. When you are on a bicycle, you have the advantage of being able to stop whenever you want to see an interesting animal or bird that you have never seen before. It is a quieter mode of transportation as well, so you might even be able to take a picture. When you are on the beach, you can breathe that clean air and view the beauty of the water and sand. It is a totally different experience from either simply sunbathing or passing it in a car. There are many choices of hiring a bicycle to experience the Gold Coast attractions. There are stores that will fit a bike perfectly to your size. These bikes for both adults and children are in many styles and colors to please any taste. If you have ever wanted to try a tandem bike , now is your chance, because they have those too. A bicycle hire on Gold Coast is something that everyone should try at least once. This is a wonderful chance for anyone who likes to cycle and it is also a cheap way to travel with your family. Question: The following advantages of hiring bikes are mentioned EXCEPT that _ .

Why is my LinkedIn profile picture blurry? There could be several reasons why your LinkedIn profile picture appears blurry. Here are some possible causes and solutions: a. Image resolution: Ensure your profile picture has adequate resolution. LinkedIn recommends using an image with a resolution of at least 400x400 pixels. A lower-resolution image may appear blurry when displayed at a larger size. b. Image format: Save your profile picture in .png or .jpg format, which are the most common image formats for the web. Avoid using less common formats that may be compressed or not render correctly. c. File size limit: LinkedIn has a file size limit of 8MB for profile pictures. If your image file is larger than this, try compressing it using an image editor or online image compressor. Note, however, that excessive compression can lead to a loss of image quality. d. Browser issues: Check if your profile picture looks blurry on multiple devices and browsers. If the problem is limited to one browser, try clearing your browser's cache and reloading the LinkedIn site. e. Connectivity issues: If your internet connection is slow or unstable, it may take longer for your profile picture to load, making it appear blurry. Ensure you have a stable, high-speed connection when uploading your profile picture and viewing your LinkedIn profile. Addressing these potential issues should help in resolving the blurry profile picture problem on your LinkedIn account."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: suppose less seeds sprout happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's think step-by-step about the process and how each step affects the outcome. 1. You plant vegetable seeds in the ground: This step decides the number of potential plants that can grow in the garden. 2. You water the seeds: This step provides the required moisture for the seeds to germinate and sprout. 3. You wait for the seeds to sprout: Fewer seeds sprouting than expected means fewer plants growing. 4. You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow: This step ensures a healthy environment for the plants to grow and produce vegetables. 5. You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow: With fewer plants than expected, thinning might not be required or will be minimal, allowing the remaining plants to have more space to grow. 6. You remove the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe: The amount of vegetables produced will be affected by the number of plants that have grown and the space available for them to grow. Now, let's analyze the effect of fewer seeds sprouting on the production of more vegetables. Since fewer seeds sprout, there will be fewer plants growing in the garden. However, the remaining plants will have more space to grow due to the reduced need for thinning. This additional space may allow the remaining plants to grow larger and potentially produce more vegetables per plant. Considering these factors, it's challenging to definitively say whether more vegetables will be produced. However, the overall effect on vegetable production is likely going to be less if there aren't enough plants to compensate for the lower sprouting rate. Answer: less effect"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked).\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What does an herbivore eat?\\" Options: - yes. - no.","completion":"No, the given sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What does an herbivore eat?\\" The sentence explains the concept of predation in an ecosystem, where a predator (an organism that hunts) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). However, this information is not directly relevant to understanding the diet of an herbivore. An herbivore is an organism that primarily feeds on plants or plant-based materials. They do not usually hunt or consume other animals, which is what the provided sentence seems to describe. Herbivores play a crucial role in the ecosystem by consuming plant matter and transforming it into energy that can be accessed by other organisms higher up in the food chain. Some examples of herbivores include: 1. Elephants - They primarily feed on leaves, twigs, and branches of trees and bushes. 2. Cows - Cows graze on grasses and other types of vegetation. 3. Deer - They forage on leaves, twigs, and shoots of plants. 4. Caterpillars - Many species of caterpillars feed exclusively on leaves and other plant parts. 5. Tortoises - Some tortoise species prefer eating vegetation, like leaves, stems, and fruits. In conclusion, herbivores predominantly consume plant matter, which is not explicitly mentioned or explained in the provided sentence. The sentence only describes the concept of predation, which relates to predators consuming prey, and does not answer the question of what an herbivore eats.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"If the freezer is cold and less ice cubes are being made, it could be due to an indirect impact on a step of the process. This can be reasoned as follows: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: The steps of the process are: putting water in an ice cube tray, putting the tray in the freezer, waiting for several hours, taking the tray out of the freezer, and bending the tray to get the ice cubes out. None of these steps have been altered or removed, which means that there is no direct impact on any of the steps. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Indirect impacts can refer to factors that affect the results or efficacy of a step without modifying its core actions. In this case, the fact that less ice cubes are being made despite the freezer still being cold could be due to a number of indirect factors that are impacting one or more steps of the process. For example, the issue could be related to an inefficiency in the freezer's ability to maintain the right temperature, an issue with the ice cube tray, or even a decrease in the room's humidity level that affects the freezing process. Such factors change the conditions of the process but not the process itself, thus indirectly impacting a step. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: If there were no changes in the expected outcomes of each step, or if no other conditions influenced the process, then the perturbation would not be affecting any step of the process. However, since less ice cubes are being made, there must be an impact. In this case, it can be ruled out that the perturbation is not impacting any step of the process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation that results in less ice cubes being made, despite the freezer still being cold, is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Further investigation into the exact cause or contributing factors would be necessary to pinpoint the specific source of the problem and implement a solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Score Movie plot: After nearly being caught on a routine burglary, master safe-cracker Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) decides the time has finally come to retire from his illegal activities and focus on running his jazz club. Nick's flight attendant girlfriend, Diane (Angela Bassett), encourages this decision, promising to fully commit to their relationship if he does indeed go straight. Nick, however, is lured into taking one final score by his fence Max (Marlon Brando). The job, worth a 4 million pay off to Nick, is to steal a valuable French scepter, which was being smuggled illegally into the United States through Canada but was accidentally discovered and kept at the Montréal Customs House.Max introduces Nick to Jack Teller (Edward Norton), an ambitious, albeit foolhardy, thief who has infiltrated the Customs House and gained access to information regarding the security by pretending to be an intellectually disabled janitor named Brian. Nick hires his associate Steven (Jamie Harrold) to hack into the Custom House's security system to obtain the bypass codes, allowing them to temporarily manipulate the alert protocols of the system during the heist. Steven is caught, however, by a systems administrator who extorts Nick for 50,000 for the information. More complications arise when they're forced to move up their time-table after the Customs House becomes aware of the true value of the scepter and adds extra CCTV cameras to monitor it while preparing to return it to its rightful owners.Nick uses a sewer tunnel to enter the Customs House basement as Jack uses the bypass codes to rig the cameras to shut off while Nick sneaks into the storage room. One of the janitors stumbles upon Jack as he is working and realizes that he is not really Brian, but Jack locks him in a closet. Meanwhile Nick fills the enormous in-floor safe containing the scepter with water before inserting and detonating a depth charge to blow off the door. He quickly packs up the scepter in a carrying case to depart, but Jack double crosses him and at gunpoint...

Article: When Jane put out the idea of homeschooling to her parents, the first reaction they gave was, \\"You are cutting the child off the world.'' \\"Did the child really get cut off or did the child socialize better?\\" The moment we hear of homeschooling, we think the child will have no opportunities to interact with peers. However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet.

Step 2: Analyze the types of organisms that breathe through gills Gills are a type of respiratory system in various aquatic organisms that extract oxygen from water and release carbon dioxide. Fish are the most well-known and iconic organisms that have gills for respiration. Step 3: Compare young amphibians to fish based on the use of gills Since young amphibians share the characteristic of breathing through gills, which is primarily associated with fish, we can establish a similarity between them. However, it is important to note that this is just one specific characteristic, and overall anatomical structures, lifestyles, and ecological roles of amphibians and fish can differ greatly. Step 4: Answer the question based on the analysis Based on the evidence from the fact that young amphibians breathe through gills, the organism most like a fish in this respect would be young amphibians. They share the gill-based respiratory system, which is a significant similarity in terms of how they obtain oxygen and survive in their aquatic environments.

Several staffers have died. The passage mentions that the author is aware of at least three people in the chemistry department who have passed away suddenly - Paul Abel, Chris, and the author's father. This could very well lead to a negative vibe in the department as their sudden loss is likely to have caused shock, sadness, and a sense of grief among the surviving staff members and families. This impact may still be felt in the department after their passing, as the department has not yet found a way to memorialize and honor those who have passed away. Establishing a way to acknowledge their loss and celebrate their lives may help alleviate some of the negative feelings that currently pervade the department. In times of loss, it is important for communities, such as the chemistry department staff and families, to find ways to come together in order to process their grief and honor those who have passed away. This could be done by setting up a memorial, holding an annual remembrance event, or creating a scholarship fund in their names. By engaging in such activities, the chemistry department can transform the negative vibe into one that fosters solidarity and positivity. Moreover, it can also create opportunities for healing among the staff and families who knew these individuals. By regularly honoring their memory, they can ensure that the legacy of those who have passed remains an integral part of the department, and their contributions continue to be recognized and valued. Such activities can also help to create a deeper sense of connection and unity for members of the department, which may help to prevent similar negative emotions in case of future losses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Describing a CD as lousy is an inherently unflattering judgement, indicating that the quality and enjoyment of the album are not up to the reviewer's expectations. The reviewer also mentions that the CD had significant hype surrounding it, with expectations of it being the \\"biggest and best\\" from Dave. However, they believe it turned out to be a \\"flop,\\" further reinforcing the unflattering portrayal of the product. Additionally, the reviewer shares their disappointment with the change in the style of music, expressing that they could not \\"quite accept the change.\\" This negative reaction to the artistic transformation suggests an unflattering view, as it implies that the stylistic shift did not resonate with the reviewer as a long-time fan. Despite the predominantly unflattering light in which the product is depicted, it is essential to note that there are some positive aspects mentioned as well. The reviewer has grown to appreciate the song \\"The Space Between\\" after witnessing the live performance on Saturday Night Live. They describe the song as an \\"amazing mix\\" of the instruments used and appreciate its similarity to previous well-regarded songs such as \\"Ants Marching\\" and \\"Crush.\\" This praise indicates that the reviewer still sees some value in the product, albeit overshadowed by the larger negative impression. In conclusion, the review mainly presents the product in an unflattering light due to the negative judgement, the perception of the album as a flop, and the disappointment with the change in musical style. However, it is not entirely negative, as there are particular songs that the reviewer appreciates and acknowledges as having merit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:The answer to the question: What are the first names of the people whose employers forbid them from creating a human-animal hybrid? is inside the article: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren., can you guess it ?

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As a little boy I read a book with a picture showing a man reading while floating in the Dead Sea. What a miracle! How would it feel to lie back in water so thick with salt that it was impossible to sink? Fed by the Jordan River and smaller streams, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on the earth's surface, and its water is ten times saltier than the Mediterranean. As evaporation is its only outlet, salt and other minerals become super-concentrated. Earlier this year, I drove down the long, steep hill to realize my dream. The shoreline was a broad area of bare salt-mud, but the water edge was out of sight. It seemed as if somebody had pulled the Dead Sea's plug . Eli Dior, an Israeli official, explained the problem \\"The Dead Sea is drying up. Every year, the surface falls about one meter, and as the water level falls, shallow areas are left high and dry.\\" Over the last half-century, the five neighboring countries have used up almost all the water flowing into the Dead Sea to meet human and agriculture needs. Result the Dead Sea is being emptied. With population in the neighbouring countries to double at least in the next 50 years, there is little hope of restoring the water being used in this area. No country has a drop to spare for the Dead Sea, where they know it will just evaporate. To dream of opening the dams and restoring natural balance is unrealistic. Yet one ambitious high-tech dream may turn out to be not only the solution to the Dead Sea but also a ticket to peace around its shores. The \\"Red-Dead\\" is a proposed 5 billion project to bring sea water some 240 kilometers by pipeline and canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. The Red-Dead may be the only solution, but even if the project is carried out successfully, the Dead Sea will be 10 to 20 meters lower than now and two thirds of its current size. Whatever the future holds, the Dead Sea's magical mix of sun, mud, sea and salt will surely survive. Many might complain that the Dead Sea is half empty--but for me the Dead...

Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chargers, the Broncos traveled to Reliant Stadium for an AFC match with the Houston Texans. The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. A 35-yard field goal by Bullock narrowed the Broncos' lead, but the Broncos increased it with two field goals from Prater in the final minute of the first half &#8212; a 25-yarder and a 44-yarder. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his 51st touchdown pass of the season &#8212; a 25-yarder to tight end Julius Thomas, in which Manning set a new NFL record for touchdown passes in a single season. With the win, coupled with the Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the Broncos clinched the AFC West division title.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Devil and Daniel Mouse Context: The story is about two struggling mouse musicians, Daniel and Jan. When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music. A frustrated Devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all his other minions with him. The two mice...","completion":"In the movie \\"The Devil and Daniel Mouse,\\" the Devil (known as B.L. Zebubb in the story) takes Jan's soul to hell when he claims it after she has achieved fame and fortune due to the contract she signed with him. Jan, unknowingly, had signed a contract in blood with the Devil, binding her to his will. He is aided by his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, in his evil schemes. Eventually, a trial is held in the woods over Jan's soul. Weez Weezel acts as the judge, and Daniel, her friend and fellow mouse musician, takes on the role of Jan's attorney. The stakes are extremely high at the trial, as the Devil has declared that he will claim both Jan's and Daniel's souls if they lose the trial. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds and a lack of legal experience, Daniel relies on the power of music and sings a heartfelt song. Jan and her band members join in, and the animals watching the trial, as well as the jury of lost souls, are moved by the music. The Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop Jan and Daniel, but they too are captivated by the soul-stirring melody. In the end, the Devil is unable to claim the souls of Jan and Daniel and, frustrated, he retreats to Hell. He takes with him Weez Weezel and his other minions, defeated by the power of music and the purity of the souls he failed to capture. The moral of the story revolves around the importance of friendship, strength in unity, and the transformative power of music that can triumph over even the darkest forces. To summarize, in \\"The Devil and Daniel Mouse,\\" the Devil initially plans to take Jan's soul to Hell when he collects on the contract she signed with him. However, his plans are thwarted when Daniel's music unites the animals and lost souls in the trial, leading to the Devil's defeat. Ultimately, the Devil returns to Hell empty-handed, taking with him his assistant Weez Weezel and all his other minions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Around two thousands agents in State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security can play only limited roles in the agency due to their previous form, reported the New York Post. The revelation is the latest disclosure in a series of scandals which are threatening to to engulf the bureau. In addition to the","completion":"discovery of agents with criminal records, the memo also revealed instances of misconduct, mismanagement, and unprofessional behavior within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Some of these cases include allegations of sexual harassment, excessive use of force, and even instances of agents engaging in unauthorized covert activities. State Deputy Inspector General Harold Geisel has expressed serious concerns regarding the overall integrity and effectiveness of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. He has called for an immediate review of the bureau's hiring practices and background check processes to prevent further infiltration of agents with dubious backgrounds. Civil society organizations and government watchdogs have also raised concerns about the impact of these revelations on the State Department's credibility in upholding and enforcing international law. Critics argue that the presence of agents with criminal records within the Agency undermines its ability to effectively carry out its diplomatic security mission, thus putting American interests and those of its allies at risk. In response to the scandal, the State Department has initiated a thorough investigation into the allegations and is working closely with the Inspector General's office to address the issue. The Department has vowed to make necessary changes to its hiring practices and improve the training and oversight of its law-enforcement agents to ensure a high level of professionalism and integrity in the future. As this news spreads, many are left wondering how such a critical lapse in the vetting and hiring process could have occurred in a prestigious government institution. Despite reassurances from the State Department, the credibility of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security will undoubtedly be at stake as it undergoes these necessary improvements and confronts the challenges posed by this unsettling revelation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Inside a former church on a suburban London street, a room has been designed to recreate the conditions found in Siberian salt mines. CNN writer Anouk Lorie relaxes in Britain's first salt cave, in Wandsworth, London. The floor and walls are covered with a thick layer of natural sea salt while particles of dry rock salt are pumped into the room. Welcome to an Eastern European style salt cave which claims to rid asthma and allergy sufferers of their breathing problems through \\"salt therapy,\\" also known as halotherapy. With the sound of waves playing in the background and the sand-like mound of salt underfoot, the place could easily be mistaken for an exotic snow beach. Before entering the salt chamber, visitors are required to wear a shower cap to cover their hair and shoes to preserve the salt's purity. During each hour-long session they simply sit back, relax and put their feet up while soaking up the saturated air and tranquil atmosphere. Salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust, pollen or pollution. Minerals including potassium and magnesium are said to clean out mucus blocking the airways. The treatment is widely used in Eastern Europe and Russia, where people with chronic breathing disorders often spend two to three hours per day in underground salt grottos. The Russian government even approved \\"salt caves\\" for medical use in 1995. In the U.S., the trend has been adopted in the Chicago area with the popular Galos Cave. Several spas in other parts of the country have also installed salt breathing rooms. In 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on patients with cystic fibrosis who used this kind of saline therapy for 48 weeks. The study found that it was a safe and effective additional therapy for patients. The benefits of salt therapy were first discovered in the late 1800s when workers in Siberian salt mines were found to suffer from a surprisingly small number of respiratory problems. Familiar with such treatments in her hometown, Sofia Benke from Hungary was therefore surprised when she moved to the UK two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country. Have you used the salt cave? Did it work for you? Would you visit one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below. \\"I was suffering from sinus problems and antibiotics didn't work. I had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends' problems, so I decided to open one in London,\\" the 30-year-old told CNN. The salt, which has no additives, is shipped in from Lithuania. Benke's patients vary from six-month-olds to 65-year-olds and most are asthmatic children who come in with their parents. Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says. The room's temperature and salt concentration depending on the patients' condition. The benefits are then said to last for up to 12 months. Each session costs around 56 and the first one is free. Many of the patients have reported positive results. Twenty-eight-year-old yoga instructor Tish Webster, who has always suffered from hay fever and severe allergies to dust, told CNN she noticed results after three sessions. \\"I noticed first thing in the morning I wasn't as congested as I usually am. Having now done ten sessions, I haven't yet taken an allergy tablet this year, which is incredible for me.\\" Despite the positive testimonials, the therapy has not yet been recognized by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and at least one study suggests the therapy should be used as a complementary therapy, not as an alternative. Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: \\"It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma. However, some people say they find them helpful. \\"Our advice to people with asthma is to follow the recommendations of your doctor or asthma nurse, and to keep them informed if you decide to try a complementary treatment such as halotherapy.\\" Other health practitioners say stopping medication like steroids for asthma and only opting for alternative care can be dangerous and counter-productive. But, according to Benke, some of her patients have stopped medication, not because she urged them to. \\"I would never do that,\\" she said. The reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy, she said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A salt cave is a special room designed to recreate the conditions found in Siberian salt mines.

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An earthquake in Pakistan, powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast, has killed more than 200 people, Pakistani officials said. The 7.7-magnitude quake struck in a remote area of southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, but it had severe consequences. At least 208 people were killed in the district of Awaran and the city of Turbut in Balochistan province, Asad Gilani, the provincial home secretary, said Wednesday. In addition to the fatalities, around 350 people have been injured, he said, and more people are still trapped in rubble. The quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the Arabian Sea like a small mountain island off the coast of Gwadar, local police official Mozzam Jah said. A large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island, he said. Large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth's crust, particularly visible along coastlines. The island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast, GEO TV reported. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, confirmed the island had formed. He said it was \\"not surprising,\\" considering the magnitude of the earthquake. But John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that generally it would be unlikely for such a large island to emerge from a quake like Tuesday's. Many things, such as the tide, could come into play regarding the rise of the island, he said. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. How many died? 2. Why? 3. Where? 4.

Natalie's urban upbringing meant that she had little to no experience with farm animals and was not accustomed to performing tasks related to maintaining livestock. Katrina, on the other hand, was familiar with the process of milking a cow, having grown up in a rural area surrounded by farm life. This gave her the advantage of understanding the techniques and nuances involved in properly milking a cow. Moreover, Katrina's greater familiarity with cows meant that she was better capable of handling the animals safely, instinctively knowing how to approach them without causing stress or discomfort. Natalie, inexperienced with such tasks, might unintentionally upset the cow during the milking process or struggle with the technical aspects of milking, slowing down the process and potentially causing issues for both her and the animal. Finally, milking a cow is an art that requires practice and skill, necessitating patience and a good understanding of the animal's behavior. Owing to her background, Katrina possessed these qualities, making her the better candidate for the task. For Natalie to become as proficient in milking the cow as Katrina, she would need to invest some time in learning and practicing the skill, until she could perform it confidently and efficiently. In conclusion, Katrina's prior experience in a rural setting and familiarity with cows made her better-suited for milking the cow than Natalie, whose city upbringing had not given her the necessary skills or understanding of livestock to perform such tasks effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, William Hundert, a retired Classics teacher, is flown out to a luxurious resort in the Hamptons owned by one of his former students in order to be the guest of honor in an impromptu reunion. As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles.

The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \\"Mr & Mrs Iyer\\".In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off. Question: is it a negative review?

What is the correct answer to this question? [1]. precipitation followed by evaporation; [2]. deposition followed by evaporation; [3]. precipitation followed by runoff; [4]. deposition followed by runoff;...A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question is [1]. precipitation followed by evaporation. Let’s delve deeper into these processes for a more comprehensive understanding. In the formation of the puddle, the process involved is precipitation. Precipitation refers to any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity to reach the Earth's surface. The definitions of rainfall or precipitation include all forms of water - solid or liquid - that fall from the sky, such as rain, sleet, snow, and hail. In our scenario, the rain that fell during the hot summer afternoon is an instance of precipitation, and this resulted in the formation of the puddle. As for the disappearance of the puddle, the process involved is evaporation. Evaporation is a type of vaporization that occurs on the surface of a liquid as it changes into the gas phase. The sun's heat causes water to evaporify into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour. When the liquid water (in this case, the puddle) is exposed to the heat, it begins to evaporate. This process is expedited on hot days, which is why you'll observe that puddles after a storm often disappear within a few hours on a hot summer day. Let’s talk about the other options briefly for clarity. Evaporation is involved in all the answers because it's the standard process for a puddle's disappearance, so our focus needs to be on the formation process. Deposition, as an option, doesn’t apply in this scenario. In the context of weather, deposition refers to the phase change from gas to solid directly, skipping the liquid phase - a process more common in the formation of frost, making answer choices [2] and [4] inaccurate in this scenario. Likewise, runoff, which is the drainage of water on the Earth's surface, could indeed remove a puddle, but it would require an incline for the water to drain off, or a porous surface where water could seep into the ground. As there's no mention of this circumstance in the scenario, we can rule out answers [3] and [4] as well. So, for a puddle to form and then disappear on a hot summer afternoon, precipitation (rain) is needed first to form the puddle, and then evaporation makes the puddle disappear. Therefore, the correct answer is [1]. precipitation followed by evaporation."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A 50-year-old American officer came back to his school.

Article:","completion":"Title: Stolen Slippers from the 1939 Movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": Crime at Staten Island Hotel A captivated audience held its breath in 1939 when Judy Garland first wore the famous ruby slippers in the classic movie, \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Since then, the enchantment has only grown, and the shoes have remained an iconic symbol of not only the film but also American pop culture. Unfortunately, the recent theft of a pair of these slippers from Staten Island Hotel has left authorities scrambling to apprehend the culprits and recover the valuable piece of history. Two weeks ago, in what seems like a carefully orchestrated heist, a trio of criminals—consisting of a blonde woman and two men—successfully managed to steal a pair of the beloved ruby slippers from their permanent display at the Staten Island Hotel. These pilfered baubles were no mere replicas but originals purchased by the hotel's owners during a trip to Paris. The Staten Island Hotel had taken great pride in possessing and showcasing such a significant and unique artifact from cinematic history. The owners had even ensured the slippers were permanently displayed, a testament to their commitment to providing a premier attraction to their guests and aficionados alike. The sheer audacity of this theft has left both the hotel staff and the wider community in a state of shock. What is particularly surprising about this audacious crime is the fact that the perpetrators managed to avoid detection despite the presence of surveillance cameras. While the video footage did capture their actions, it has not yet led to their identification or capture. The blonde woman was seen entering the hotel with her two male accomplices in tow, and after executing their theft, the group calmly walked away from the scene of the crime, careful not to act suspiciously and avoid raising alarm. As part of their investigation, law enforcement has been diligently reviewing the available video footage to see if it can provide any further clues that might lead to the criminals or the stolen slippers. In addition, they have been reaching out to other hotels and businesses in the area to inquire whether any similar crimes have occurred and if there might be any connection. While the whereabouts of these cherished shoes remain unknown, fans of the 1939 film and aficionados of classic American cinema alike have been deeply disheartened by this brazen theft. What was once an awe-inspiring piece of history, enjoyed by countless viewers in the hotel, has now been taken, forcing the public to confront the dark underbelly of modern-day criminal behavior. The ruby slippers from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" have long been a timeless symbol of the enchanting power of film. With their disappearance from the Staten Island Hotel, we are starkly reminded of the fragility of our connection to the past. It is the hope of the hotel proprietors, law enforcement, and fans worldwide that the shoes will soon be recovered, and the criminals brought to justice, allowing the allure of these magical slippers to once again shine brightly. Until then, we are left with a sense of loss and longing for a return to more innocent times, both in film and in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Channel Four Television Corporation (informally Channel Four) is a publicly owned media company headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

To do that, first subtract 51 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term added with s: 116*s + 51 - 51 = -993 - 51 116*s = -1044 Now that we have isolated the term containing s, we need to isolate s itself. To do that, divide both sides of the equation by 116, which is the coefficient of s: (116*s) / 116 = -1044 / 116 s = -9 So, the solution to the linear equation 28*s + 88*s + 51 = -993 is s = -9."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. They have been held every four years since then, except during the two world wars. Question: The earliest recorded Olympic Games took place in _ .

Please briefly summarize this news article: Gingrich in bull's-eye at GOP showdown A lot had changed for Newt Gingirch since the last GOP debate, a CNN showdown in Washington just before Thanksgiving that was focused on national security and foreign policy. (CNN) -- Six candidates will be on the stage Saturday night at the Republican presidential debate in Iowa, but one of them may have the most on the line. With time running out -- there are just more than three weeks until the Iowa caucuses -- all of the candidates need a strong showing, but Newt Gingrich has the most at stake. A lot has changed for the former House speaker since the last GOP debate, a CNN showdown in Washington just before Thanksgiving. Since then, Gingrich's numbers have soared. He's the front-runner in latest national polling and in new CNN/Time ORC International surveys in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida, three of the first four states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. Our poll also indicates that he's closing the gap with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in New Hampshire, which holds the second contest. But rising poll numbers are also putting Gingrich in the line of fire, and verbal shots will most likely be fired at Drake University in Des Moines, site of the debate hosted by ABC News, the Des Moines Register and the Republican Party of Iowa. In the past week, the Romney campaign, as well as the campaign of Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, have stepped up attacks on Gingrich. \\"The debate will be more serious, and sharper lines will be drawn,\\" said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \\"The Republican establishment is in full panic about Gingrich's success. They fear he will blow himself up and incinerate the entire GOP ticket along with him. Newt inspires strong emotions both for and against his candidacy. I would expect Newt to be attacked consistently by the other candidates ... and to respond by saying, 'I certainly seem to be the focus of attention, almost like I am the front-runner here. I must be doing something right,' \\" added Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and for Romney's 2008 nomination bid but who's not taking sides this cycle. Keep your eyes on Romney, Paul, Rep. Michele Bachmann of neighboring Minnesota and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who've also criticized Gingrich, to see how forceful they are at taking on the new man at the front of the pack. Gingrich's campaign was left for dead by many in May and June, after a number of controversies spurred some of his top advisers and staffers to quit, and that left the campaign coffers in the red. But the former House speaker has performed well in the 11 major GOP presidential debates this year, often acting as the elder statesman while many of his rivals for the nomination attacked each other. He also won over the audiences by repeatedly criticizing the moderators' questions. Thanks to his debate performances and the fading poll numbers of contenders such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Bachmann and businessman Herman Cain, who suspended his campaign last weekend, Gingrich's numbers have skyrocketed. But as we've seen, Gingrich can often be his own worst enemy. \\"After this debate, we will have a good idea if Newt Gingrich has grown enough to avoid blowing himself up within the next few months,\\" Castellanos said. The timing is also crucial. The debate, which will be followed by a second Iowa showdown five days later, comes less than four weeks before Iowa's January 3 caucuses. \\"The timing of these two debates is fortuitous. With the primary schedule abruptly moved forward, these will be the last opportunities for candidates to directly address voters before both the Christmas holiday and the important Iowa caucus. Those last impressions could help determine who wins the nomination,\\" said Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee communications director who is in the Hawkeye State as a senior adviser to the Republican Party of Iowa. \\"Fewer candidates on the stage makes a big difference. The closer you get to the altar, the less voters look at which candidate they want to date, and the more they consider who they can marry and live with for a long time,\\" Castellanos added. While traditional campaigning in the early voting states remains important, this cycle debates seem to have outsized importance. A poor debate performance in June helped force former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty out of the race, and stumbles in the debates this autumn were major factor in then-front-runner Perry's collapse in the polls. \\"Make no mistake, debates matter. The past debates have shown how a candidate's fortune can rise or fall due to debate performance,\\" Heye said. The most important people watching the debate are Iowa Republicans who have yet to back a candidate. \\"I'm still undecided. I am looking for a candidate that can beat Obama!\\" said Becky Beach, a GOP strategist and Iowa resident. What issues is she looking for when it comes to the debate? \\"It would be reducing the federal debt and cutting government spending, so we can create jobs,\\" she said. \\"While faith is important, whoever can turn the economy around matters most,\\" added Beach, who describes herself as a social conservative. Summary:","completion":"Six Republican candidates, including Newt Gingrich, are set to appear at the presidential debate in Iowa, which comes three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Gingrich's fortunes have dramatically improved since the last GOP debate, with new polls indicating he is the front-runner both nationally and in the early primary states of Iowa, South Carolina, and Florida. However, his rise in popularity has made him a target for the other candidates. Although his campaign was in trouble earlier in the year, solid debate performances and declining support for other contenders has led to a surge in his polling numbers. The debate is crucial as it is one of the last opportunities for the candidates to address voters directly before the holiday season and the important Iowa caucus. Past debates have often resulted in a significant shift in a candidate's fortunes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The classifications you can assign for the sentiment are \\"POS\\" for positive and \\"NEG\\" for negative. Let's breakdown the guidelines to understand how to complete the task: 1. Read the sentence carefully: Understanding the statement is very crucial to deducing the sentiment behind it. Here, the statement is: \\"Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story.\\" 2. Assess the sentiment: Assess whether the reviewer is expressing a positive or negative sentiment about the movie. In this statement, words like \\"bungle\\" suggest the reviewer is criticising the movie. They imply that the director and screenwriter have not performed well, comparing their narrative to a series of Bible parables rather than an actual story, suggesting confusion or lack of cohesion. 3. Classify the sentiment: Based on your assessment, assign the appropriate classification. In this case, because the sentiment of the sentence is negative, the classification would be \\"NEG\\".

Carryl that is a pastiche imitation of Lewis Carroll's famous work Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is \\"Davy and the Goblin: Or, What Followed Reading 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'\\". This book, published in 1884, is an American reimagining and tribute to Carroll's iconic work and is Carryl's most famous literary contribution. \\"Davy and the Goblin\\" shares some elements with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, showcasing a blend of the fantastical, nonsensical, and surreal encounters that are a hallmark of Carroll's masterpiece. The novel's protagonist, eight-year-old Davy, embarks on a whimsical journey that pays homage to the adventures experienced by Alice in Wonderland. In Carryl's story, Davy starts reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland right before going to bed. Soon after, while still half-asleep, he encounters the Goblin, a fantastical creature reminiscent of the Cheshire Cat in Wonderland. The mysterious Goblin serves as a guide for Davy on his journey, leading him through a series of fantastical, otherworldly, and comical situations called the \\"Believing Voyage\\". Similarities with Carroll's classic are apparent throughout the novel, as Carryl employs wordplay, nonsensical scenarios, and unconventional characters to create an engaging world for young readers. Davy engages in seemingly absurd conversations with various fanciful characters, including the Melancholy Pigs, the Candy City residents, a retired weather god, and even renowned literary figures such as Robinson Crusoe and Sinbad the Sailor. These interactions are filled with humor, wit, and clever parodies of familiar stories, creating a delightful read for children and an enchanting literary journey for adults. At the same time, the novel reflects the landscape of 19th-century America, incorporating elements related to current events and popular culture of the time, thereby giving it a uniquely American identity and setting it apart from Carroll's original British tale. The use of imagination in \\"Davy and the Goblin\\" also serves to highlight the importance of self-discovery and adventure through literature and fantasy. The novel encourages readers to explore the boundless potential of their thoughts, indulge in the world of enchanting tales and, ultimately, interpret their experiences in a way that helps them grow and develop. In conclusion, Charles E. Carryl's novel \\"Davy and the Goblin: Or, What Followed Reading 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'\\" is a loving tribute and pastiche imitation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The novel cleverly employs similar techniques and themes, such as the abundance of wordplay, nonsensical encounters, and dream-like progression, while also establishing its unique American identity and offering a fresh perspective on the genre. Through the protagonist's adventures, Carryl emphasizes the importance of imagination, literature, and self-discovery in the lives of the readers, regardless of their age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A man in the military is sitting at a table talking into a microphone.\\", is the sentence \\"A man sitting at a tabling is talking about his experiences.\\" a true sentence? Choices: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","completion":"[II] it is not possible to tell The original sentence and the second sentence tell us about a man who is sitting and talking. However, they provide different details about the situation. In the first case, the man is identified as being in the military and he is talking into a microphone. This can mean various things - he could be giving an address, participating in a radio show, recording a podcast, and so on. The exact nature of what he's doing or what he is talking about isn't specified. On the other hand, the second sentence says the man is sitting at a table talking about his experiences, but it doesn't identify who the man is or whether he's in the military like in the first sentence. He could be anyone – a teacher, a retiree, a lawyer, etc. Moreover, while the first sentence specifically mentions the man talking into a microphone, the second sentence does not. This means the situation could be different – maybe he's talking to another person at the table, or maybe he's speaking to a group without a microphone. The specifics about whether he's in the military from the first sentence and the exact nature of the situation from the second sentence make it difficult to definitively say whether the second sentence is a true sentence based on the first one or not. Therefore, the most accurate answer to this question would be \\"it is not possible to tell\\". We don't have enough information from these two sentences to determine whether one is true based on the other. There are possibilities in both sentences that suggest they could be describing the same situation, but without additional information or context, we cannot definitively say the second sentence is true based on the first."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Australia Day is the anniversary of the arrival of Britain's first settlers in 1788, an event many indigenous Australians refer to as \\"Invasion Day\\". Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised the council's decision. \\"The council is using a day that should unite Australians to divide Australians,\\" he said in a statement. \\"An attack on Australia Day is a repudiation of the values the day celebrates: freedom, a fair go, mateship and diversity.\\" The council said it had made its decision following months of consultation. \\"We have been informed very consistently from the Aboriginal community in Yarra and more broadly that it is not a day of celebration for them,\\" Mayor Amanda Stone told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. \\"It is very hard to reconcile having a day of national celebration when one whole sector of the population feels excluded.\\" However, she said the council had also taken many calls from people opposing the decision. Calls to shift Australia Day have grown in recent years. This year, \\"Invasion Day\\" protests were held around the country. Last year, a Western Australian council also attempted to shift its celebrations but reversed its decision following pressure from Mr Turnbull's government.

On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented. The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse. In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \\"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change. The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 \\"thumbs down\\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days. Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \\"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\\" and \\"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system\\".

Article: If you really want to go green, here's good news: eating green is good for you. The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves.

The rationale behind this conclusion lies in the fact that unused energy from food, regardless of its source (carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids), gets stored in the body as fat. An additional 3,500 calories of energy would lead to the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Over time, consistently consuming more food energy than required can result in obesity. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30.0 kg/m2, where BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). Obesity comes with an increased risk of various health problems, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Since Group Brown consumed significantly more calories than Group Yellow and thereby gained more weight, their likelihood of becoming obese or experiencing weight-related health problems is higher. It is essential to note that individual factors may also contribute to one's susceptibility to obesity and related health issues.

The main question appears to be about how students transition from high school to college, which is only loosely related to whether we should worry about kids leaving high school. There are several factors at play when a person transitions from high school to college, and various methods schools, communities, and governments employ to support and prepare students for higher education. Here are some key points to consider that may help provide a clearer understanding of the broader situation: 1. College readiness: This is an essential aspect of preparing high school students for the next phase of their education. College readiness involves not only academic skills but also emotional, social, and financial preparedness. Schools can develop programs and support systems to ensure that students are well-prepared in these areas. Additionally, efforts such as mentorship, college fairs, and career counseling can help in making informed decisions about post-secondary education options, easing the transition to college. 2. Access to financial resources: The cost of higher education can be an obstacle for many families. Schools, non-profit organizations, and governments can work together to provide information and access to financial resources, such as scholarships, grants, and loans, thus ensuring that students from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds have an opportunity to attend college. 3. Academic support and tutoring: Upon entering college, some students may need additional academic support to bridge any gaps in their high school education or adjust to the rigors of college coursework. Colleges can provide tutoring services, learning centers, or specialized programs to support students in their academic journey and promote retention and success. 4. Career guidance and support: Some high school students may choose to enter the workforce or pursue alternative career paths instead of attending college. In these cases, it's essential to provide them with the resources to develop skills, job-seeking strategies, and opportunities to explore various career options. 5. Social and emotional well-being: The transition from high school to college or the workforce can be emotionally stressful for young adults. Schools, families, and communities can collaborate to ensure that students feel supported and have access to resources that promote positive mental health and overall well-being. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell from the question whether we should or should not worry about kids leaving high school, as this concern depends on a range of factors and individual circumstances. It is crucial to focus on providing students with the tools, resources, and support systems they need to make a successful transition from high school to college or other educational or career paths and to ensure their overall well-being during this critical phase of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. into our first office, in which Google was born. With excitement we typed the name of the thing which we created with love on September 14th 1998--www. google.com. Now, after those years we bought this garage. As a symbol it will always remind us that everything is possible.

Information: - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Jesse Ventura (born James George Janos on July 15, 1951), is an American former professional wrestler, actor, political commentator, author, naval veteran, and politician who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was the first and only member of the Reform Party to win a major government position, but later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota. - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County, and larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, containing about 3.5 million residents. As of 2015, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with a population of 410,939. Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest, after Chicago. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Voter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, and/or religion. - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence. - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Politics (from Greek: Politiká: P\\"olitika\\", definition \\"affairs of the cities\\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. - The Independence Party of Minnesota (often abbreviated IPM, MNIP or IP), formerly the Reform Party of Minnesota, is a political party in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was the party of former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura (19992003). - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Politika is a Serbian daily newspaper, published in Belgrade. Founded in 1904 by Vladislav F. Ribnikar, it is the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in the Balkans and is considered to be Serbia's newspaper of record. - Anishinaabe (or Anishinabe, plural: Anishinaabeg) is the autonym for a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of Canada and the United States that include the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Oji-Cree, Mississaugas, and Algonquin peoples. The Anishinaabeg speak Anishinaabemowin, or Anishinaabe languages that belong to the Algonquian language family. They traditionally have lived in the Northeast Woodlands and Subarctic. - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - MinneapolisSaint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota. The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the city with the largest population in the state, and Saint Paul, the state capital. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) as The Cities. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans). - The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota. - Tom Horner ( born July 23 , 1950 ) is a Minnesota politician and a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota .

Q: Increased rates of apoptosis have been reported to play a role in the pathophysiology of many disorders, including liver diseases. Conversely, genetic mutations that result in impairment of programmed cell death have been associated with cancer development. However, apoptosis resistance can also be the result of nongenetic stress adaptation, as seen in the cancer-prone metabolic liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia. To clarify whether stress-induced apoptosis resistance is a general feature of chronic liver diseases, an animal model of chronic cholestasis was examined.', 'Studies were performed with mice before and 2 weeks following bile duct ligation and with Fah-/- and Fah/p21-/- mice before and after NTBC withdrawal.', 'Here we show that bile duct ligation induced profound resistance against Fas monoclonal antibody-mediated hepatocyte death. The apoptosis signaling pathway was blocked downstream of caspase-8 activation and proximal to mitochondrial cytochrome c release. In controls, activation of the Fas receptor resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of Bid and its subsequent cleavage, whereas Bid remained phosphorylated and uncleaved in chronic cholestasis and other models of hepatic apoptosis resistance. A:","completion":"To determine if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal, we need to break down the passage to understand its purpose and direction. 1. The passage begins by discussing the role of increased apoptosis rates in various disorders, including liver diseases.

It proceeds to mention the need for clarity on whether stress-induced apoptosis resistance is a general feature of chronic liver diseases. This inquiry sets up a potential objective or goal for the passage. 3. The passage describes an animal model of chronic cholestasis being examined and provides details about the studies performed on mice under various conditions. 4. Lastly, it presents and elaborates on the findings of the studies, discussing the behavior of the apoptosis signaling pathway and the cellular compounds involved. Considering these points, it becomes evident that the passage aims to explore the link between stress-induced apoptosis resistance and chronic liver diseases using specific studies on an animal model.

The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

The only difference between the two sentences lies in the usage of the words \\"questions\\" and \\"issues\\", which are used interchangeably here. Both words refer to topics or subject matters being written about or discussed.

What is the name of the person who debated with Stephen Douglas in 1858 who was an American politician and served as the 16th President of the United States?","completion":"The name of the person who debated with Stephen Douglas in 1858 and later served as the 16th President of the United States is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky. He is well-known for his leadership during the American Civil War and for playing a pivotal role in the abolition of slavery. Lincoln was a member of the Republican Party, which had been formed as an anti-slavery coalition by groups of former Whigs and Northern Democrats in the mid-1850s. In 1858, Lincoln engaged in a series of seven debates with Stephen A. Douglas, a prominent Democratic politician from Illinois. The debates, known as the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, took place during the Illinois Senate race, where both Lincoln and Douglas were vying for the same Senate seat. The debates garnered national attention and focused primarily on the issue of slavery, which was a pressing concern for the nation at that time. During the debates, Lincoln argued against the spread of slavery into new territories, while Douglas defended his concept of \\"popular sovereignty.\\" Popular sovereignty essentially meant that the citizens of a territory should be allowed to decide whether or not to permit slavery within their borders. Although Lincoln lost the Senate race to Douglas, the debates significantly raised his national profile, ultimately leading to his nomination as the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1860. Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election and was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. His tenure was marked by a series of major events, such as the secession of Southern states from the Union, the outbreak of the Civil War, and the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery throughout the country. Unfortunately, Lincoln's life was cut short when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, just days after the Confederacy's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Despite the tragic ending to his presidency, Abraham Lincoln remains a deeply revered figure in American history for his role in preserving the Union and advancing the cause of freedom and equality for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
