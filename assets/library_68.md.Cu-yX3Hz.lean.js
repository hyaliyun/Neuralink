How is \\"Don't worry about provoking grizzly bears; they come that way.\\" said in German?","completion":"In German, the phrase \\"Don't worry about provoking grizzly bears; they come that way.\\" can be translated as \\"Mach dir keine Sorgen, Grizzlybären zu provozieren; sie sind von Natur aus so.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - Mach dir keine Sorgen: This translates to \\"Don't worry\\" or \\"Do not be concerned\\" and is an informal way to address a person to help them not worry about something. - Grizzlybären zu provozieren: This means \\"provoking grizzly bears\\" and is the action that one should not worry about. - sie: This translates to \\"they\\" and refers to the grizzly bears being mentioned. - sind von Natur aus: This part translates to \\"are by nature\\" or \\"come that way\\" and explains the inherent characteristic of the grizzly bears. - so: This translates to \\"so\\" or \\"like this\\" and is used to emphasize the characteristics of grizzly bears mentioned before. So, putting it all together, the full translation is \\"Mach dir keine Sorgen, Grizzlybären zu provozieren; sie sind von Natur aus so.\\" This tells the listener not to worry about provoking grizzly bears because they are naturally like that."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"give\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"The word \\"give\\" appears in both sentences, but the context and implied meanings are different in each case. In the first sentence, \\"Can I give you the children for the weekend?\\" the use of \\"give\\" suggests that the speaker is seeking help, most likely temporary care, for the children while they attend to other responsibilities or activities during the weekend. In this case, to \\"give\\" means to temporarily entrust the care of the children to someone else. This use of \\"give\\" refers to a transfer of responsibility and supervision. In the second sentence, \\"Can I give you my keys while I go in the pool?\\" the use of \\"give\\" refers to temporarily handing over an object (the keys) for the purpose of safekeeping while the speaker engages in an activity where having the keys would be inconvenient or unsafe (swimming in the pool). In this context, \\"give\\" means to provide or pass on an item for a specific purpose. While the underlying concept of transferring something from one party to another is consistent in both sentences, the nature of what is being transferred and the reasons behind it differ. In the first sentence, the transfer is about the responsibility and care of children; it goes beyond simply giving an item. In the second sentence, the transfer is limited to physical possession of the keys, with no additional responsibilities implied. To summarize, although the word \\"give\\" is used in both sentences, the context and meaning change based on the specific situations described. In the first sentence, \\"give\\" is about entrusting the care and supervision of children, whereas in the second sentence, it has a more straightforward connotation of passing an object for safekeeping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why is economics considered a social science? Economics is considered a social science because it examines the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations in the management and allocation of resources. The primary focus of economics is to understand and predict human behavior in relation to scarce resources, which include not only money but also time, talent, and natural resources. As a social science, economics employs scientific methods and systematic inquiry to study the various ways in which people make choices and interact with one another within the context of their economic activities. Some of the key areas that economics focuses on are the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and the resulting impact on overall wealth and welfare. It also examines how government policies and institutions can affect economic performance. Economists use both quantitative (e.g., statistical models, econometrics) and qualitative (e.g., case studies, historical analysis) research methods to study these phenomena. In doing so, they aim to generate theories and models that can help explain complex economic behavior and inform public policy decisions. By linking individual choices to larger economic systems, economists are able to shed light on some of the most pressing social issues, such as unemployment, income inequality, and environmental sustainability. In summary, economics is considered a social science because it deals with the study of human behavior in relation to the allocation and distribution of resources. It employs scientific methods to investigate economic relationships and patterns, with the ultimate goal of improving public policy and social welfare. Question 2: Is philosophy considered a social science? Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes. Answer: (A). no. Philosophy is not considered a social science because it deals with the study of fundamental questions and concepts in areas such as existence, knowledge, logic, ethics, and aesthetics. While social sciences focus on the empirical study of human behavior and societal structures, philosophy uses critical thinking and logical arguments to explore abstract ideas and seek answers to profound questions about the nature of reality, truth, and morality. Philosophy can be broken down into several branches, such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. While some branches of philosophy may occasionally intersect with social sciences, its primary method of inquiry is through rational discussion and the development of philosophical theories, rather than empirical observation and experimentation. Although philosophy and social sciences both strive to improve our understanding of the world and human experience, they use different approaches and methods. Philosophy seeks to understand the conceptual foundations of human thought, while social sciences aim to systematically study human behavior in social contexts. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking why economics is considered a social science, while question 2 is asking whether philosophy is considered a social science or not. Both questions involve the classification of academic disciplines as social sciences, but they are focused on two different subjects - economics and philosophy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 33*r + 39 = 6 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 33*r + 39 = 6 for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable r. To do this, you'll want to get rid of the number (39) being added to the 33*r term. You can achieve this by subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation: 33*r + 39 - 39 = 6 - 39 This simplifies to: 33*r = -33 Step 2: Solve for r. Now, you have an equation of the form 33*r = -33. To isolate r and find its value, you'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 33: (33*r) / 33 = (-33) / 33 Both the numerator and denominator on the left side of the equation have 33 in common, so they cancel each other: r = (-33) / 33 Step 3: Simplify the expression.

Mike, a rugged and affable local trucker, spends his days hauling freight across the infinite stretches of American highways. He's seen a multitude of faces in his rear-view mirror, but none as intriguing as the worn, haunted features of James, a recently discharged soldier hitchhiking his way home. James, struggling with a profound case of PTSD from his time in Afghanistan, gets picked up by Mike on a sweltering summer day. He's reticent at first but Mike's congenial attitude and a shared appreciation for classic rock hits gradually dissolves James' apprehensions. As their journey progresses, Mike, beneath his hearty exterior, struggles with his quiet dilemmas - a terminal diagnosis and a stained rapport with his estranged son, Will. During their long trip, Mike and James form an unlikely friendship as they share stories of life, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit. James confides about the horrors of war, the comrades he lost, and the struggle to adjust to civilian life. Mike shares his regrets about his strained relationships and the fear of his impending demise. Upon learning about Mike's situation, James hatches a plan, he decides to reconcile Mike with his estranged son, Will, who also happens to be a discharged soldier, tormented by his own war no less real than his father's. But, Will has his reservations fueled by a long history of resentment towards his father. As they reach Will's town, an unexpected event forces Mike, James, and Will to confront their fears and face their past in a dramatically volatile showdown. Tested in a crucible of adversity, they discover new connections, old resolutions, and the boundless dimensions of forgiveness. In the end, Mike's truck, initially a vessel on a standard cargo mission, evolves into a vehicle that carries hope, redemption, and kinship, answering the initial question of who picked up the hitchhiking soldier and opening up a new chapter of possibilities. The story concludes on a hopeful note, with James and Will assuming the helm of Mike's rig, driving towards the horizon, symbolizing their journey ahead. \\"The Long Haul\\" becomes more about their enduring voyage towards healing, forgiveness, and self-discovery than just a highway route."},{"prompt":"Information: - Michael D.

Problem:By Nick ServiniPolitical editor, Wales Nick Ramsay, Antoinette Sandbach, Mohammad Asghar and Janet Finch-Saunders rebelled in a vote on the devolution of income tax. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, had already disagreed with the then Welsh Secretary David Jones about the issue. Mr Jones has denied suggestions the move was prompted by his sacking in this week's cabinet reshuffle. A Conservative source had indicated that the reshuffle was the reason behind the AMs return to the front bench. But Mr Jones, whose place in the cabinet was taken by his former deputy Stephen Crabb on Tuesday, told BBC Wales that whoever had made such claims was motivated by \\"personal spite\\" against him. The former Welsh secretary said he had spoken to Nick Ramsay, Antoinette Sandbach and Janet Finch-Saunders last week, and they had all told him they were being reinstated, but that the announcement was not being made until now. Mr Ramsay has been appointed shadow finance minister, Ms Sandbach is shadow environment minister, Ms Finch-Saunders will speak for her party on local government and Mr Asghar becomes shadow minister for equalities and sport. The roles had previously been shared out among other members of the shadow cabinet. Lockstep The assembly vote which led to problems on the devolution of income tax revolved around whether the so-called lockstep should remain. This is the rule which means that if income tax was devolved then Welsh ministers would not be able to alter individual tax bands. Instead, any changes up or down would have to be mirrored across all of the bands. Mr Davies wanted Wales to have more flexibility, while Mr Jones wanted the lockstep to remain. The two men had a public disagreement over the issue. The four AMs voted against Mr Davies and were effectively sacked for siding with Mr Jones and, ultimately, siding with the prime minister because the lockstep was the policy of the party at Westminster and was the model being devolved. The affair became a major embarrassment for the party at Cardiff Bay, and made it an easy target for Carwyn Jones during First Minister's Questions. It was also said that Downing Street was unhappy with the state of affairs and the issue had led to criticism of the role played by the former Welsh secretary. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the main topic of the text. Usage: The main topic of the text is the political tensions and reshuffling within the Welsh Conservative Party involving disagreement over income tax devolution and lockstep policy.

Answer based on context: The Vikes fell to 4-3 with a loss at home on Monday Night Football to the New England Patriots. The Pats, who came out passing instead of bothering to even try challenging the Vikings rush defense, got out to an early lead on the opening drive as QB Tom Brady hit WR Reche Caldwell for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Kicker Stephen Gostkowski connected on a 23-yard field goal early in the second quarter. Brady threw his second of what would turn out to be four touchdown passes, this time to TE Benjamin Watson just before halftime to give the Pats a 17-0 lead. The Vikes finally got on the board as RB Mewelde Moore returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter. That would be all the Vikes could muster as Brady threw his final two touchdowns to wide receivers Troy Brown and Chad Jackson respectively to close out the scoring. Which team had the lead at the start of the second quarter?","completion":"Based on the context provided, the New England Patriots had the lead at the start of the second quarter. This is because they scored on the opening drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Reche Caldwell, and there is no mention of any other scoring plays by the Vikings before the second quarter began."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world. However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

Previously, a referendum had been scheduled for March 30 on the less politically charged question of whether Crimea should have greater autonomy within Ukraine.

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\".

Write a summary based on this article: “There has been unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction,” Mr. Reid said as he set in motion the steps for the vote on Thursday. “The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.” Republicans accused Democrats of irreparably damaging the character of an institution that in many ways still operates as it did in the 19th century, and of disregarding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate as a body of “advice and consent” on presidential nominations. “You think this is in the best interest of the United States Senate and the American people?” asked the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, sounding incredulous. “I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you’ll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,” he added. Mr. Obama applauded the Senate’s move. “Today’s pattern of obstruction, it just isn’t normal,” he told reporters at the White House. “It’s not what our founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal, and for the sake of future generations we can’t let it become normal.” Photo Only three Democrats voted against the measure. The changes will apply to all 1,183 executive branch nominations that require Senate confirmation — not just cabinet positions but hundreds of high- and midlevel federal agency jobs and government board seats. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This fight was a climax to the bitter debate between the parties over electoral mandates and the consequences of presidential elections. Republicans, through their frequent use of the various roadblocks that congressional procedure affords them, have routinely thwarted Democrats. Democrats, in turn, have accused Republicans of effectively trying to nullify the results of a presidential election they lost, whether by trying to dismantle his health care law or keep Mr. Obama from filling his cabinet.

Republicans saw their battle as fighting an overzealous president who, left to his own devices, would stack a powerful and underworked court with judges sympathetic to his vision of big-government liberalism, pushing its conservative tilt sharply left. The court is of immense political importance to both parties because it often decides questions involving White House and federal agency policy. Republicans proposed eliminating three of its 11 full-time seats. When Democrats balked, the Republicans refused to confirm any more judges, saying they were exercising their constitutional check against the executive. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said Democrats had undercut the minority party’s rights forever. “We have weakened this body permanently, undermined it for the sake of an incompetent administration,” he said. “What a tragedy.” With the filibuster rules now rewritten — the most significant change since the Senate lowered its threshold to break a filibuster from two-thirds of the body to three-fifths, or 60 votes, in 1975 — the Senate can proceed with approving a backlog of presidential nominations. Photo There are now 59 nominees to executive branch positions and 17 nominees to the federal judiciary awaiting confirmation votes. The Senate acted immediately on Thursday when it voted with just 55 senators affirming to move forward on the nomination of Patricia A. Millett, a Washington lawyer nominated to the Washington appeals court. Two other nominees to that court, Cornelia T. L. Pillard and Robert L. Wilkins, are expected to be confirmed when the Senate returns from its Thanksgiving recess next month. The filibuster or threats to use it have frustrated presidents and majority parties since the early days of the republic. Over the years, and almost always after the minority had made excessive use of it, the Senate has adjusted the rules. Until 1917, the year Woodrow Wilson derided his antiwar antagonists as “a little group of willful men” who had rendered the government helpless through blocking everything in front of it, there was no rule to end debate. From 1917 to 1975, the bar for cutting off debate was set at two-thirds of the Senate. Some would go even further than Thursday’s action. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said that he would like to see the next fight on the filibuster to be to require senators to actually stand on the floor and talk if they wanted to stall legislation. The gravity of the situation was reflected in an unusual scene on the Senate floor: Nearly all 100 senators were in their seats, rapt, as their two leaders debated. As the two men went back and forth, Mr. McConnell appeared to realize there was no way to persuade Mr. Reid to change his mind. As many Democrats wore large grins, Republicans looked dour as they lost on a futile, last-ditch parliamentary attempt by Mr. McConnell to overrule the majority vote. Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Mr. McConnell left the chamber, he said, “I think it’s a time to be sad about what’s been done to the United States Senate.” ||||| The Senate voted Thursday to change its rules to prevent the minority party from filibustering any nominations other than nods to the Supreme Court. The change was approved after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry ReidThe Trail 2016: When elections and terrorism intersect Democratic super-PAC launches ad against Portman Warren steps into 2016 fray, calls Trump a ‘loser’ MORE (D-Nev.) triggered the “nuclear option,” which allows a change to Senate rules by majority vote. The 52-48 vote dramatically changes the rules of the Senate and limits the minority party's ability to prevent confirmation of presidential nominees. Sens. Carl Levin (Mich.), Mark Pryor (Ark.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) were the only Democrats to vote against Reid's rules change. ADVERTISEMENT It will allow all three of President Obama's nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to go forward, as well as his nomination of Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) to lead a housing regulatory agency. Obama praised the action. “The gears of government have to work and the step that a majority of senators took today I think will help make those gears work just a little bit better,” he said in a statement from the White House briefing room. Reid said the change was necessary to get the Senate working again. “It’s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete,” Reid said on the Senate floor. “The American people believe Congress is broken. The American people believe the Senate is broken. And I agree.” The procedural motion is known as the nuclear option because critics warn it would obliterate bipartisan relations in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ripped Reid for triggering it. McConnell accused Democrats of picking a “fake fight over judges” to try and “distract the public” from the problems of ObamaCare. “It only reinforces the narrative of party willing to do or say just about anything to get its way,” said McConnell. “One again, Democrats are threatening to break the rules of the Senate ... in order to change the rules of the Senate,” he said. “And over what? Over a court that doesn’t have enough work to do.” After the vote, McConnell declined to comment on the prospect of Republican retaliation. “I don’t think this is the time to be talking about reprisals. I think it’s a time to be sad about what’s been done to the United States Senate,” he said. The specific procedural vote to change the Senate's rules was to sustain the ruling of the chair that nominees need 60 votes to advance to final passage. Democrats voted against sustaining the ruling of the chair and in favor of changing the Senate's rules. The final vote was 48-52. In his floor comments, Reid said the filibuster had rendered the Senate’s basic duty of confirming presidential nominees “completely unworkable.” “The need for change is so, so very obvious,” he said. “These nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote, but Republican filibusters deny them a fair vote, any vote, and deny the president his team.” The two parties have effectively changed sides on the nuclear option since Democrats gained control of the upper chamber in the 2006 election. Republicans accused Democrats of hypocrisy for embracing a controversial tactic they criticized in 2005, when Republicans threatened to go nuclear to move then-President George W. Bush’s stalled nominees. “To change the rules in the Senate can't be done by a simple majority. It can only be done if there is extended debate by 67 votes,” Reid said in May of 2005. “They are talking about doing something illegal. They are talking about breaking the rules to change the rules, and that is not appropriate. That is not fair, and it is not right,” he said in April of that year. But Democrats countered that McConnell was ready to vote for it when then-Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) wanted to strip the minority of the power to filibuster eight years ago. The dispute that triggered the rules change was over three of President Obama’s nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second-most-powerful court in the nation. Republicans have blocked the nominations of Patricia Millett, an appellate litigator; Cornelia Pillard, a Georgetown Law School professor; and Robert Wilkins, a judge on the District Court for the District of Columbia. Reid said Republicans floated a last-minute deal by offering to confirm one of the D.C. Circuit nominees to avoid the rules change. The Senate voted 55 to 43 immediately after the rules change to end a filibuster of Millett. Reid proposed scheduling a final vote on her nomination after the Thanksgiving recess if Republicans agreed to speed up consideration of the defense authorization bill. Reid had come under growing pressure from his conference to use the nuclear option to fill the court's vacancies. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), an outspoken proponent of rules reform, circulated a memo to the media Thursday morning defending the tactic. He noted that then-Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) used it on March 5, 1980, when he eliminated filibusters on motions to proceed to nominations. He argued the Senate has changed its procedures by a simple majority vote at least 18 times since 1977. “The notion that changing Senate procedure with a simple majority vote is ‘changing the rules by breaking the rules’ is false,” he wrote. — This story was posted at 10:22 a.m. and updated at 2:20 p.m. ||||| Senate Majority Leader Sen.

(Associated Press) Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2013. The Senate is nearing a potential showdown on curbing the power that the Republican... (Associated Press) The Democrat majority in the Senate on Thursday pushed through a major rules change, one that curbs the power of the Republican minority to block President Barack Obama's nominations for high-level judgeships and cabinet and agency officials. The move was certain to only deepen the partisan divide that has crippled passage of legislation. Infuriated over repeated Republican blocks of Obama candidates for critical judgeships, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took the dramatic step, calling it \\"simple fairness\\" because the change would work in Republicans' favor whenever they regain the White House and a Senate majority. Current Senate rules allowed any one member of the chamber, using a tactic called a filibuster, to block a president's nominations unless 60 of the 100 Senators vote to move forward with the nomination. The 60-vote threshold has proven difficult for Democrats to assemble given they hold only a 55-45 edge over the Republicans in a hyper-partisan political climate and stalemated Congress. \\"The gears of government have to work,\\" Obama said shortly after the Senate vote. In a brief White House appearance to congratulate his fellow Democrats, Obama complained that the old filibuster rule allowed opposition senators to avoid voting their conscience on legislation on which a yes vote could put them under attack from the far rightwing of the party. Known as the \\"nuclear option,\\" Reid said the rules change would help break partisan gridlock that has sent voter approval of Congress to record lows. He forced a vote on requiring only 51 votes to end a filibuster. The change would not end the 60-vote threshold for overcoming blocking action for Supreme Court nominees or legislation. The change is the most far-reaching to filibuster rules since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was eased to today's three-fifths, or 60-vote, level. It would make it harder for the opposition party to block presidential appointments. The latest battle is over Obama's choices to fill three vacancies at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since Oct. 31, Republican filibusters derailed the president's nominations of District Judge Robert L. Wilkins, law professor Cornelia Pillard and attorney Patricia Millett for those lifelong appointments. The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight sitting judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees. Three seats are vacant. \\"They have decided that their base demands a permanent campaign against the president and maximum use of every tool available,\\" said Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley, a leading advocate of revamping filibuster rules that have been used a record number of times during the Obama presidency. He said Republican tactics are \\"trumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent.\\" Republicans said they are weary of repeated Democratic threats to rewrite the rules. They say Democrats similarly obstructed some of President George W. Bush's nominees and argue that the D.C. Circuit's caseload is too low, which Democrats reject. \\"I suspect the reason they may be doing it is hoping Republicans overreact, and it's the only thing that they could think of that would change the conversation about Obamacare,\\" said Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, using the nickname for Obama's troubled health care law. \\"But we're not that dumb.\\" Reid use of the nuclear option procedural move would allow him to change the filibuster rule with just 51 votes, meaning Democrats could push it through without Republican support. Senate rules are more commonly changed with 67 votes. Nomination fights are not new in the Senate, but as the hostility has grown the two sides have been edging toward a collision for much of this year. ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ||||| The Senate approved a historic rules change on Thursday by eliminating the use of the filibuster on all presidential nominees except those to the U.S. Supreme Court. Invoking the long-threatened “nuclear option” means that most of President Barack Obama’s judicial and executive branch nominees no longer need to clear a 60-vote threshold to reach the Senate floor and get an up-or-down vote. Text Size - + reset Mitch McConnell responds In 90 secs: What's driving the day Speaking at the White House, Obama praised the Senate action, accusing Republicans of attempting to block his nominees based on politics alone, not on the merits of the nominee. “This isn’t obstruction on substance, on qualifications. It’s just to gum up the works,” he said. (PHOTOS: Harry Reid’s career) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) used the nuclear option Thursday morning, meaning he called for a vote to change the Senate rules by a simple majority vote. It passed, 52 to 48. Three Democrats voted against changing the rules — Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. “It’s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete,” Reid said in a lengthy floor speech on Thursday morning. A furious Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who tried to recess the Senate for the day before the rules change could get a vote, said after the minority’s power was limited by Democrats: “I don’t think this is a time to be talking about reprisal. I think it’s a time to be sad about what has been done to the United States Senate.” But McConnell quickly noted that Republicans could fix the problem in the upcoming midterm elections if they regain the majority: “The solution to this problem is an election. The solution to this problem is at the ballot box. We look forward to having a great election on 2014.” The debate over the filibuster — and specifically its use on D.C. Circuit nominees — has been raging for nearly a decade, stretching back to when George W. Bush was president and Democrats were in the minority. But changing the Senate rules has always been avoided through a piecemeal deal, a gentleman’s agreement or a specific solution, not a historic change to the very fabric of the Senate. (Also on POLITICO: Reid: GOP playing with fire on judges) But since Obama’s nomination, the “nuclear option” has reared its head three times in less than a year — each time getting closer to the edge. Many in the Senate privately expected that this go-round would be yet another example of saber rattling, but Reid said pressure was increasing within his own party to change the rules. The blockade of three consecutive nominees to a powerful appellate court was too much for Democrats to handle — and Reid felt compelled to pull the trigger, explaining that “this is the way it has to be.” It didn’t take long for Republicans to begin circulating both Reid’s and Obama’s past statements opposing a rules change. But the majority leader said that things escalated to a level that even he had not thought possible in 2005, when a “Gang of 14” banded together to stop a rules change. “They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then reelected,” he said. “I have a right to change how I feel about things.” (Earlier on POLITICO: Court nominees: Battleground for partisan politics) Senate Democrats were quick to use their newfound powers, voting in the early afternoon to end the filibuster on Patricia Millett’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote was 55-43, with two senators voting present. Before the change earlier Thursday, Millett would have needed 60 votes to clear the procedural hurdle and move on to a confirmation vote. But now, she needed just 51 to advance. In his speech, Obama noted that in the few decades before he took office, about 20 nominees were filibustered. Since he took office, close to 30 judicial and political nominees have had their nominations blocked. “It’s no secret that the American people have probably never been more frustrated with Washington, and one of the reasons why that is, is that over the past five years, we’ve seen an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress that’s prevented too much of the American people’s business from getting done,” Obama said. “Today’s pattern of obstruction just isn’t normal. We can’t allow it to become normal.” Obama also cited the filibuster of a gun control bill earlier this year, although Thursday’s rule change would preserve the filibuster for Supreme Court picks and legislation. |||||","completion":"In the past, there was a big disagreement between Democrats and Republicans about how the Senate works and how they choose people for important jobs. Mr. Reid, a Democrat, believed the Senate needed to change its rules so it could work better. Republicans disagreed and believed that changing the rules would damage the Senate. Mr. Obama, who was the president at that time, supported changing the rules and said that not allowing him to choose people for important jobs was not normal. He said they couldn't let this become the normal way of doing things in the Senate. The changes finally happened and affected many jobs in the government, making it easier for people chosen by the president to be confirmed without too many delays. This was called the \\"nuclear option,\\" which involved changing the Senate rules by majority vote. The vote passed because more than 50 senators voted for the change. In the end, only 3 Democrats voted against it. This historic change made it so that most presidential nominees wouldn't need 60 votes to get an up-or-down vote; they would only need 51. This helped to break the disagreements between both parties in the Senate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which types of boards have four holes where the binding threads were laced through? The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques.

The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. Farming gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). At Damaidi in Ningxia, 3,172 Neolithic signs in China dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, \\"featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing\\". These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC. Some scholars have suggested that Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BC) were the earliest Chinese writing system. Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5,500 to 4,900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators. In late Neolithic times, the Yellow River valley began to establish itself as a center of Yangshao culture (5000 BC to 3000 BC), and the first villages were founded; the most archaeologically significant of these was found at Banpo, Xian. Later, Yangshao culture was superseded by the Longshan culture, which was also centered on the Yellow River from about 3000 BC to 2000 BC.

Here is a question about this article: The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments. Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom.

She has an elder brother, Anand. Her father is a diamond merchant. She is of Sindhi descent. Context: In 2005, at the age of 15, she played the female lead in Chand Sa Roshan Chehra which was a commercial failure at the box office. The same year, she made her debut in Telugu cinema with Sri and in Tamil cinema with Kedi in 2006. IndiaGlitz in its review called Tamannaah as the \\"real scene-stealer\\" and stated that she \\"walks away with all honors\\", adding that her characters have shades of the characters played by Vijayashanti in Mannan (1992) and Ramya Krishnan in Padayappa (1999). Her first release of 2007 was Shakti Chidambaram's Viyabari in which she played the role of a journalist who wants to write an article about a successful entrepreneur played by S. J. Suryah. The film opened to negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Tamannaah received praise for her performance. She got her breakthrough with Sekhar Kammula's Happy Days and Balaji Sakthivel's Kalloori, both of which featured Tamannaah as a college student. She won critical acclaim for her performances in both films. The commercial success of Happy Days and Kalloori established her career as an actress in both Telugu and Tamil films. Her performance in the latter earned her a nomination at the 56th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Tamil Actress category. Her first release of 2008 was the Telugu film Kalidasu directed by debutante G. Ravicharan Reddy. She was paired with debutante Sushanth, the grandson of actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao. Upon release, the film opened to moderate reviews and critics felt that she looked good and very romantic but had less scope to perform. The film was an average grosser at the box office. She later made a cameo appearance in the Telugu film Ready followed by another cameo appearance in the Telugu - Tamil bilingual Ninna Nedu Repu titled Netru Indru Naalai in Tamil.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Reacher shoots the zec in the head. for the following movie plot: In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park and, after dropping a quarter into the meter, readies a sniper rifle. He takes aim and kills five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before fleeing in the van. The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed. During an interrogation by Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never failed to convict. Thinking Barr is going to confess when he takes the notepad, they are bewildered when he instead writes \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a drifter and former U.S. Army Military Police Corps officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher's request to view the evidence but agree to let him see the suspect. Barr, as it turns out, was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while in police custody and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr's defense attorney, counselor Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the District Attorney's daughter, who's been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty. Helen says she can arrange for Reacher to see the evidence if he will become her lead investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten.

It can hybridize with Lelwel hartebeest to make the Kenya Highland hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel x cokii ) . - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae. - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water. - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\". - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. It is famous for having the Nairobi National Park, the world's only game reserve found within a major city. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County, whose current governor is Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor is Jonathan Mueke. What is the relationship between 'coke's hartebeest' and 'subspecies'? A:","completion":"Coke's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus cokii), also known as kongoni, is a subspecies of the hartebeest, which is an antelope native to Kenya and Tanzania. In this context, the term 'subspecies' refers to a distinct, geographically defined variant within a species. Subspecies often exhibit some genetic differentiation, physical characteristics, and behavioral traits that set them apart from other populations of the same species. The relationship between Coke's hartebeest and subspecies can be understood by examining the differences between Coke's hartebeest and other hartebeest subspecies. While all belonging to the Alcelaphus buselaphus species, each subspecies has adapted to its specific geographic range, sharing a common lineage but exhibiting variations in traits such as size, coloration, and horn shape. These differences enable the subspecies to adapt to the unique environmental conditions in their respective habitats. In summary, Coke's hartebeest is a subspecies of the hartebeest species. The term 'subspecies' denotes a geographically defined variation within a species, with unique characteristics that have evolved in response to specific environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please download Flash from the Adobe download website. President Nicolas Sarkozy has surged into the lead in election opinion polls following his handling of the crisis in Toulouse where a gunman is under siege suspected of killing of seven people. The first survey since Monday's killings predicted Mr Sarkozy would narrowly beat his Socialist challenger in the first round of a presidential election next month. The poll of 1,000 people, carried out on Monday and Tuesday, put Mr Sarkozy on 30% in the first round and Francois Hollande on 28%. However, it showed Mr Hollande would win a second-round run-off by a margin of 8%. The two rivals were neck and neck a week ago. :: France Shootings - See The Latest Until now Mr Hollande has enjoyed a large lead over the president, whose economic record and showy style left many voters dissatisfied. However, Mr Sarkozy's response to Monday's shootings seems to have improved his image. The rivals suspended their campaigns after three children and a rabbi were shot dead at a Jewish school in Toulouse in southwest France, killings that followed the shooting dead of three soldiers earlier this month. Suspected gunman Mohammed Merah The shootings, allegedly by 24-year-old Muslim Mohammed Merah in the name of al Qaeda, have allowed the French president to play his preferred role of protector-in-chief and put a new focus on security, traditionally a strong point. He has repeatedly appeared on national television giving information on the manhunt and presiding over a ceremony for the fallen soldiers, while Mr Hollande has had little choice but to remain on the sidelines. Meanwhile, far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is number three in the polls, says her anti-Islam agenda has been vindicated because the chief suspect in the country's worst killing spree in years is a French Muslim who claims ties to al Qaeda. France, she says, must \\"wipe out\\" the Islamist threat, arguing it is corrupting the French culture and has not been taken seriously enough by the authorities. ||||| The French interior minister says the suspect in a three-attack killing spree has died after jumping from his apartment window, arm in hand.

It was not immediately known exactly how Mohamed Merah, 24, died. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Loud explosions and sustained gunfire have been heard in Toulouse near the apartment where an Islamic extremist has been holed up in a 32-hour standoff with French police. There was no way of immediately knowing whether the shooting was coming from the special police to intimidate the suspect or in an exchange volley with him. The suspect, 24-year-old Mohamed Merah, has boasted of killing seven French citizens _ a rabbi, three Jewish children and three French paratroopers in an attempt to \\"bring France to its knees.\\" They are believed to be the first killings inspired by Islamic radical motives in France in more than a decade. Authorities said Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, espoused a radical form of Islam and had been to Afghanistan and the Pakistani militant stronghold of Waziristan, where he claimed to have received training from al-Qaida. France's interior minister has said police wanted to capture him alive. Elite police squads set off sporadic blasts throughout the night and into the morning _ some blew off the apartment's shutters _ in what officials described as a tactic aimed to pressure 24-year-old Merah to give up. A new set of detonations, known as flash bangs, resounded at about 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT). Police were using their advantages _ numbers, firepower and psychological pressure _ in hopes of wearing down Merah, who has had no water, electricity, gas or most likely sleep, and perhaps no food, since the early hours of Wednesday. Holed up alone in an otherwise evacuated apartment building, Merah clung to his few remaining assets, like a small arsenal and authorities' hopes of taking him alive. He appeared to toy with police negotiators _ first saying he would surrender in the afternoon, then under the cover of darkness, then reneging on those pledges altogether, officials said. \\"We still want him alive so he can be tried and so the families can mourn properly,\\" Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Europe 1 radio. They said he told negotiators he killed a rabbi and three young children at a Jewish school on Monday and three French paratroopers last week to avenge the deaths of Palestinian children and to protest the French army's involvement in Afghanistan, as well as a government ban last year on face-covering Islamic veils. French authorities _ like others across Europe _ have long been concerned about \\"lone-wolf\\" attacks by young, Internet-savvy militants who find radical beliefs online, since they are harder to find and track. \\"Lone wolves are formidable adversaries,\\" Gueant said. He defended France's efforts to fight terrorism over the past decade, saying 700 people have been detained and about 60 \\"Islamists with terrorist tendencies\\" are currently in French prisons. Merah's lawyer predicted a dramatic and somber end to the standoff. \\"He wants to show he is exceptional, omnipotent, and this approach can only end up as something tragic,\\" Christian Etelin said on news channel i-Tele on Thursday. He said Merah had tried to join the military but was rejected. He said Merah was also disillusioned after a string of convictions for petty crimes and after efforts to reduce his sentences through work programs failed. \\"He felt rejected by the periods of detention he was handed out, and for his wish to defend France in the army. Now, he is in a process of hate,\\" Etelin said. \\"He has no regrets, except not having more time to kill more people, and he boasts that he has brought France to its knees,\\" prosecutor Francois Molins told a news conference Wednesday. He said the suspect had plans to kill another soldier _ prompting the police raid at around 3 a.m. Wednesday. After it erupted into a firefight, wounding two police, a standoff ensued, with on-and-off negotiations with the suspect that lasted through the night. ___ Jamey Keaten in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| Toulouse Siege: Gunman Killed In Shootout To view this content you need Flash and Javascript enabled in your browser. Please download Flash from the Adobe download website. A man suspected of murdering seven people in France has been killed by police as he jumped from a window still firing wildly at the end of a 32-hour siege. Mohammed Merah, 23, was shot in the head after officers stormed his flat where he was holed up since early on Wednesday. He filmed the three recent attacks in Toulouse and Montauban which claimed the lives of three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi, and three French soldiers, prosecutor Francois Molins said. Mohammed Merah had been holed up in a flat in Toulouse Merah claimed to have posted the videos online and police have viewed them. It comes as al Qaeda linked group Jund al Khilafah, which has claimed responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and Kazakhstan, said it was behind the shootings in France, according to US monitoring group SITE. Merah staged a dramatic last stand as he burst out of a bathroom and blasted an automatic weapon at officers, before diving for the window while still shooting. GRAPHIC: HOW THE SIEGE ENDED The gunman, who reportedly told negotiators he wanted to \\"die with weapons in his hands\\", was found dead on the ground, according to French interior minister Claude Gueant, who watched the drama while peaking from behind an armoured vehicle outside the flat. The police unit that carried out the raid \\"had never seen anything like it before,\\" Mr Gueant said, confirming two officers were injured. Final negotiations were unsuccessful late on Wednesday after Merah indicated he would not surrender and if there was any attempt to seize him he would kill police, according to the minister who ordered the final raid. Officers entered the property in the southwestern city of Toulouse, creeping step-by-step around the flat, checking each room carefully before they reached the bathroom when Merah burst out, bombarding them with bullets. Mr Gueant had earlier said police wanted to capture Merah alive. A series of explosions, known as flash bangs, were heard at 10:30am (9:30am GMT), marking the beginning the end of the stand-off. Police, who used special video equipment to search for Merah, had been concerned the property might have been booby-trapped. Mr Gueant told reporters that Merah came out firing \\"with extreme violence\\". Police \\"tried to protect themselves and fired back\\". \\"Mohammed Merah jumped out the window, gun in hand, continuing to fire. He was found dead on the ground,\\" Mr Gueant added. Heavy gunfire was heard at the scene as the raid took place. sustained gunfire as police move in on suspect The building was surrounded by hundreds of police and Merah had been holed up in the flat since an earlier police assault on Wednesday. Elite police squads had set off sporadic blasts overnight - some which blew off the flat's shutters - and cut off power to the evacuated building as they tried to persuade the suspect to give himself up. Gas supplies had reportedly been cut on Wednesday morning. Street lights had also been turned off, making Merah more visible to officers with night vision goggles. Criminologist Sebastian Roche said many questions now needed to be answered about the decision to move in. He told Sky News: \\"They intervene in the middle of the night, then they wait 30 hours, then there is a political decision to terminate this very clearly.\\" Mr Gueant earlier said: \\"We hope that he is still alive\\" so he could face justice, adding the gunman told negotiators he wanted to \\"die with weapons in his hands\\". Mr Roche said: \\"The views of Mr Merah have prevailed over the views of the minister of the interior.\\" Explaining how politicians can control police tactics in France, he said: \\"The minister of the interior is the head of all police services… there is no notion of operational autonomy as you have in the UK.\\" Merah apparently boasted about carrying out the shootings in separate incidents in the past fortnight. The suspect, a French citizen of Algerian descent, reportedly bragged to negotiators he was trained by al Qaeda on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He was thought to be armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a mini-Uzi submachine pistol and a collection of handguns and when police tried to storm his flat in the early hours of Wednesday, he was reported to have shouted \\"I can see you\\" and fired through the letterbox. video of toulouse gunman suspect mohammed merah Officers tried to negotiate with Merah who said he would surrender on Wednesday afternoon, then at night, and he ended up going back on those pledges altogether. Mr Molins said the suspect boasted about bringing \\"France to its knees\\" and had planned to kill another soldier - prompting the first police raid. The assault then erupted into a firefight with two police officers hurt as a stand-off developed. Speaking before Merah's death, Mr Molins said: \\"He has no regrets, except not having more time to kill more people and he boasts that he has brought France to its knees.\\" Authorities said he had told negotiators he killed a rabbi and three young children at a Jewish school in Toulouse on Monday and three French paratroopers - one in Toulouse and two in Montauban - last week. He claimed he carried out the shootings to avenge the deaths of Palestinian children and to protest against the French army's involvement in Afghanistan, as well as a government ban last year on face-covering Islamic veils, officials added. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said authorities \\"tried everything to ensure he (Merah) was caught alive so he could come to trial but that was not possible\\". Mr Sarkozy said an investigation was under way to see if the suspect had any accomplices. He also said anyone who regularly visits \\"websites which support terrorism or call for hate or violence will be punished by the law\\". And he promised a crackdown on anyone who goes abroad \\"for the purposes of indoctrination in terrorist ideology\\". Mr Molins said the suspect had gone to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region twice and on one occasion was arrested by Afghan police and handed over to US army troops, who put him on a flight back to France. :: READ MORE - The Gunman's Trail Of Deadly Shootings :: READ MORE - Behind The Scene At Police Stand-Off :: READ MORE - A Profile Of Merah :: READ MORE - Updates On The Siege, As It Happened Video footage has emerged of Merah, and sources said the suspect had been known to the domestic security service for some years. He had a police record for several minor offences, some involving violence, Mr Gueant told reporters, \\"but there was no evidence that he was planning such criminal actions\\". A lawyer who defended Merah last month on charges of driving without a licence told French television that he had been \\"gentle\\" and \\"courteous\\" and that he had told him about his trip to Afghanistan. The lawyer said he had pointed out to Merah that he would therefore, doubtless be under surveillance, and should not commit even the smallest infraction. Police and prosecutors said they arrested Merah's mother, brother and his brother's girlfriend as part of the inquiry. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A man named Mohammed Merah was responsible for shooting and killing seven people in France.

Information: - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem . - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation. - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - First-order logic also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers. - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas: - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in occurs both in and , implies , and implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem. - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth. - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System. - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions: - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape. - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics. - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering. - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

Analyze the premise: The premise states, \\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford.\\" This implies that the speaker is pleased to meet Mr. Beresford. 2. Analyze the hypothesis: The hypothesis states, \\"It's nice to meet you Mr. Beresford.\\" This implies that the speaker is expressing a pleasant experience upon meeting Mr. Beresford, which echoes a similar sentiment to the premise. 3. Compare the premise and hypothesis: Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a positive, friendly sentiment towards Mr. Beresford upon meeting him. Conclusion: Given the similarities in sentiment expressed in both the premise and hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true (the speaker is delighted to make Mr. Beresford's acquaintance), then the hypothesis (it's nice to meet Mr. Beresford) is also likely to be true, as they both convey a positive attitude towards meeting Mr. Beresford."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I recently dined at The Cozy Corner Café, a delightful little restaurant nestled in our bustling city, and I am thrilled to say it exceeded my expectations in many ways, notwithstanding a minor hiccup that was promptly resolved. Reflecting on my dining experience, I am excited to share my thoughts, which will hopefully paint a vivid picture of why the place is a must-try! Upon entering The Cozy Corner Café, the warmth of its atmosphere engulfed me, emanating an instant sense of comfort and relaxation, which I believe is no small feat in the competitive world of modern dining. The décor was a lovely mix of rustic charm and contemporary accents, creating a unique blend that felt like an inviting home away from home. Getting our hands on the extensive menu was the next highlight in our culinary sojourn, and it was nothing short of impressive. Featuring an array of appetizing selections across various cuisines, it catered to diverse palates. This speaks volumes about the versatility and thoughtfulness put into curating such an ambitious lineup of gastronomic delights. Now on to the speed bump we encountered: Our orders took longer than anticipated to arrive at our table. The wait was a bit disappointing, considering our expectations were set high by every other aspect we encountered. However, to the restaurant's credit, the kind and genuine server swiftly addressed our concern, admitting they were swamped but were working diligently to get our food to us. This was a constructive acknowledgment of the issue, which impressed us and eased our growing impatience. Once the food did arrive, it became clear that the wait was worth it! Each element on our plates was cooked to perfection and presented with meticulous attention to detail. The flavors danced with perfect harmony, showcasing the chef's expertise in blending myriad textures and tastes. I personally had the seared salmon with roasted root vegetables and lemon-caper sauce, which I can confidently say is my new favorite dish! My companion's penne alfredo showcased a delightfully creamy sauce, which, by itself, merits a return trip to this charming locale. Before concluding, I must commend the restaurant's commitment to using sustainable and locally-sourced ingredients. This not only adds a layer of freshness but also demonstrates a conscious effort to support local farmers and community-based initiatives. All things considered, The Cozy Corner Café is unquestionably worthy of a visit. The ambiance, fantastic menu selections, and focus on locally-sourced ingredients make it easy to overlook the wait time we experienced. Moreover, the restaurant's capacity to accept constructive feedback and promptly address concerns is undoubtedly a strength that sets them apart from the competition. Therefore, I am happy to give them a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit!"},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Movie title: They Call Us Misfits Movie plot: The film begins with an interview with Tompa, a friend of Kenta and Stoffe. He tells how he grew up in orphanages and juvenile prisons. He says that freedom hardly exists for him, but one thing is he sure of is that the time he spent with Kenta and Stoffe and the other mods was the most enjoyable time of his life. The interview cuts to Kenta and Stoffe running through the streets of Stockholm filmed with a fisheye lens. Later, we see them walking around at the subway station T-Centralen in Stockholm. They meet friends and go around begging people for food, beer and cigarettes. The workers who are passing by get ridiculed by Kenta and Stoffe. Another friend of the guys, Jojje, talks about how alcohol will destroy them in time, but that he doesn't worry much about it right now. The filmmakers have fixed a small apartment for Kenta and Stoffe which is a big difference for the guys who previously slept outdoors or in the apartments of others. Kenta and Stoffe talk about their childhood. Stoffe's father drank himself broke and died in a hospital. Kenta's father tried to strangle him with a tie. Stoffe also remembers that he thought it was fun to play at home when he was little. We see the two guys go to \\"4:an\\", a club for young people. Stoffe likes to be with many girls, but tells Eva, who he sleeps with, that he wants her for himself. Kenta and Stoffe make a musical performance, where they play a song by The Zombies. It is now winter and a trip to Hedemora in Dalarna is taken accompanied by Hasse. They plan to visit Stoffe's childhood friend Ingmar. On the train, they drink beer, smoke pot and make jokes. The mood is high, but they decide they can't stay in Hedemoraâthe contrast from the big city of Stockholm is too great. Stoffe thinks nothing happens in Hedemora. In Stockholm, there is Peter, who earns 400 kronor a day by selling drugs, and Lunkan, who got hepatitis from an infected hypodermic syringe.

Q: Casey gave Alex a first aid kit to hold while she addressed a wound Alex acquired playing volleyball. Given the question \\"What does Casey need to do before treating Alex's wound?\\", is \\"Pull out her phone and call an ambulance\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"Pull out her phone and call an ambulance\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What does Casey need to do before treating Alex's wound?\\". Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Assess the situation: First, Casey needs to determine the severity of Alex's wound and whether it requires immediate professional intervention or if it can be treated on the spot with the first aid kit. 2. If the wound is minor and can be treated on the spot, Casey should: a. Wash her hands or put on gloves to maintain cleanliness. b. Clean the wound gently with water and soap, avoiding getting dirt or debris inside the wound. c. Apply an antiseptic ointment or alcohol wipe to prevent infection. d. Add a bandage or gauze to protect the wound. 3. If the wound is severe, is not stopping to bleed or seems infected, then Casey might need to call an ambulance for professional medical help. So, calling an ambulance would only be necessary if the wound is severe or beyond Casey's capability to treat with the first aid kit. The initial focus should be on assessing the wound and determining the appropriate course of action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days?, using the article: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut..., what would be the answer ?

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… How does the actress feel about the playwright?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Occasional rewards will sweeten the tasks and help keep you on track. If you manage to do something that you didn't the day before or that you were absolutely dreading, you deserve a nice treat. By rewarding yourself after completion of small milestones along the way to the big one, you build in automatic reinforcement that you're doing the right thing. Keep most rewards simple but effective, such as extended breaks, catching a movie, splurging on a calorie-laden snack (once in a while!) or similar things. Leave really large rewards for the overall achievement or endpoint. By using self-rewards, you'll train your mind to actively seek working before the reward. Breaks are rewards and necessities. Don't confuse the need to take regular short breaks to restore creativity and freshness with laziness. Clearly, the flip side to rewards is punishment. People respond best to positive reinforcement and it's best to stick to the rewards. Punishing yourself for not achieving things will simply backfire, confirming your worst-held beliefs about yourself that you're lazy and good-for-nothing. That's a pointless exercise if ever there was one. A list of weekly goals will help you stay focused and motivated. As you go, it's inevitable that your goals will change. You'll also pinpoint the ways that are most effective for achieving them. As they morph, so should your list. Post the list everywhere and anywhere. Try making it your lock screen on your device or phone. To do this, simply write them in your notes, take a screenshot and make it your background. Create daily goals, monthly goals, and even yearly goals to keep looking at every day differently. To enjoy any benefit, there is usually a cost to be suffered. The pain/suffering cost is usually emotional, often physical and sometimes psychic. Often that pain involves a feeling of being left out or going without while others don't seem to be putting up with the same challenges (usually they have their own challenges which you don't see though). And that pain can cause you to avoid, distract and seek safety in a comfort zone. To push past your comfort zone, you'll need to face the pain before you can reach the possibilities. Assess whether a potential benefit is worth the cost to you. If it is worth it (and most times, it will be), draw on your ever-evolving maturity to generate the required courage, endurance and discipline that will give you the strength to achieve brilliant outcomes. Nobody achieves anything without effort and pain. Most experts, professionals and geniuses will readily admit that most of their achievements are 99 percent sweat and one percent talent. Undisciplined talent gets few people anywhere –– excellence in academics, financial autonomy, sports, the performing arts and relationships demands steady and consistent thoughtfulness and work that strains even the best of us emotionally and physically. Your will to survive and flourish needs to translate to your will to work and suffer when to do so is both necessary and useful. You won't be a great businessman, a great runner, a great cook, or even great at your job overnight. You'll fail and fail and fail and fail. This is normal. This is good. This means you're still going. Having too many activities or distractions in your daily life can make it easy to avoid the things you need to do. Try to declutter your schedule by delegating important tasks and removing non-necessary ones. Turn off distractions, and focus on your goals. For example, if you are trying to write 1,000 words every weekend but find you keep falling short because of your extracurricular activities, consider getting rid of one of them. By cutting out even one one-hour meeting a week, you'll have more time to reach your goal. There will be times when it gets harder and post-reward you can sometimes feel a bit flat about returning to the task at hand. In such times, you'll need to draw on inner reserves to remind yourself of the goal or solution sought to stay focused. Make the most of feeling that you're on a roll –– when you're in that state (often termed \\"the flow state\\"), use it to leap to another task or goal as soon as you're done rewarding yourself. The longer that you delay restarting after finishing one element in your tasks or goals, the harder it becomes to restart. Remember the feelings of being deeply involved in getting things done, and how good it feels to achieve things. And the sooner you restart, the more confident you'll feel and the sooner these good feelings will be restored. Consider asking someone to be your accountability partner. If, for example, you have a goal of going to the gym every day, ask a friend to hold you accountable. Text them every day after you go. If you don't go, have them text you to remind you of your goal. It's one thing to find your motivation. But it's quite something else to keep it going when the going gets tough, especially in the face of unforeseen problems. Realize that interruptions happen, often for no reason, and they'll upend your efforts. Rather than letting setbacks demotivate you, see them for what they are and refuse to be flattened by them. You're not alone and staying focused on working through challenges is one of the best ways of coping and bouncing back. Remind yourself how much you want to achieve your goal or task, seek help where needed, take stock of what you have already achieved and then refuse to give up. You got this. Summary:","completion":"Occasional rewards can help you stay on track and motivated while working towards your goals. Make sure to take breaks and don't punish yourself for any setbacks, as positivity is more effective for personal growth. Adjust your goals as necessary and maintain weekly, monthly, and yearly goals for continued focus. Embrace the effort and pain required to achieve your desired outcomes and learn from your failures. Declutter your schedule to minimize distractions and delegate tasks if possible. Draw on your inner reserves during challenging times and consider finding an accountability partner to help you stay on track. Be persistent in the face of setbacks and interruptions, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than reasons to give up.

Two polls released Wednesday in the showdown state of Florida suggest that it might, unless Newt Gingrich can re-energize his populist, anti-establishment coalition before next Tuesday's vote.From mid-December, when Romney launched his first offensive against Gingrich, through the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, divide and conquer was the decisive dynamic in the GOP race. Romney moved into the lead during that period because he consolidated the center of the party behind him more than any one of his rivals consolidated the right of the party against him. Instead, conservatives fragmented among a long menu of choices.That pattern flipped in Gingrich's crushing South Carolina victory last Saturday. Gingrich ran better among the key elements of what could be called the GOP's populist wing-including evangelical Christians, strong tea party supporters, non-college voters, those earning less than 50,000 annually and voters who identify as very conservative-than Romney did among the opposite groups in the GOP's managerial wing (non-evangelicals, non-Tea Party supporters, moderates, and more affluent and college-educated voters.) In South Carolina, Gingrich actually won some of those more centrist and pragmatic groups. Even when he didn't, he held down Romney's margin among those groups-while running up his own advantage among their conservative mirror images.The CNN/Time/ORC Florida survey released this afternoon looks less like South Carolina than it does like Iowa.

Monthly Archives Categories Recent Posts ||||| Polling released within the past 24 hours suggests that Mitt Romney has stopped and possibly reversed Newt Gingrich’s momentum before the Florida primary on Tuesday. The FiveThirtyEight forecast model still projects Mr. Gingrich as the slight favorite in Florida, giving him a two-point lead and a 60 percent chance of victory. However, this lead is diminished considerably from two days ago, when the model saw a potential double-digit win for Mr. Gingrich, as polls released immediately after the South Carolina primary had him surging in Florida. In fact, I suspect that the model is being too conservative and that there is enough evidence — when you look carefully at the day-to-day results — to conclude that Mr. Romney has re-emerged as the slight favorite in Florida instead. The complication in Florida is that there are two conflicting trends. It should be quite obvious that Mr. Gingrich’s position is much stronger than it was before Jan. 16; after his strong performance in a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., that night, s support began rising sharply in state and national polls. However, it looks as though Mr. Gingrich’s surge may have reached its apogee over the weekend — timed perfectly for his big win in South Carolina, but not necessarily for one in Florida next week. The chart below probably does the clearest job of telling the story. It shows the results of all recent Florida polls based on the dates the poll takers were in the field. Often, this includes more detail on the day-by-day breakdowns than is available from the poll’s top-line results, based either on additional information published in the pollster’s cross-tabulations or detail that the polling firm made available to FiveThirtyEight. In the chart, you see Mr. Gingrich gaining on Mr. Romney over the course of last week — and then surging ahead after his win in South Carolina. However, since the weekend, Mr. Gingrich appears to have lost ground on Mr. Romney with each passing day. Visually, it seems quite obvious what is going on, and there is a lot to be said for that. Pattern recognition is one of those things that our brains tend to be pretty good at — better, usually, than computer algorithms. On the other hand, there is some information that this chart disguises that something like the FiveThirtyEight forecast model picks up on. For instance, the CNN poll released on Wednesday showed Mr. Gingrich performing much worse in the interviews it conducted on Monday and Tuesday — when he trailed Mr. Romney by nine points — than in the ones it conducted on Sunday, the day after his South Carolina win, when Mr. Gingrich led Mr. Romney by six points instead. However, the sizes of these subsamples are tiny — CNN interviewed 369 voters in total, and dividing them up in this way yields margins of sampling error in the range of about 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, some of the polls released on Sunday and Monday had considerably larger sample sizes. Another pollster to show this kind of shift — the American Research Group — has performed well this year in the first three early-voting states. But its overall track record has been quite mixed. Because the model considers things like a firm’s track record and the sample size of a poll in addition to the field dates, it’s not quite persuaded that the short-term trend over the past 48 hours is enough to outweigh the medium-term trend toward Mr. Gingrich, for which there is less ambiguous evidence. Meanwhile, some of the anecdotal evidence still seems quite favorable for Mr. Gingrich: he has drawn much larger crowds than Mr. Romney to his events in Florida, for instance, which could be a sign that his voters are more enthusiastic and more likely to turn out. Still, I think the model is being too stubborn in this instance, and this is one of those times I would probably bet against its forecasts. It is not as if all of this is happening in a vacuum: there was a debate, for instance, on Monday night, and although both pundit reaction and polls of debate watchers suggested that it was more or less a draw, Mr. Romney may have done enough damage on Mr. Gingrich’s ties to Freddie Mac and his resignation as House speaker to raise fresh doubts in voters’ minds about his candidacy. Another piece of context is that the polls have been unusually volatile all year, perhaps because of the way the news cycle is changing and speeding up. The model uses data going as far back as 1980 to calibrate its results. Perhaps back then, it would have been appropriate to be skeptical that Mr. Gingrich could lose his momentum so quickly — especially when this evidence is based on polls with limited sample sizes or mixed track records. But we may be living in a different world now. And yet, that volatility suggests that even if Mr. Gingrich has lost the momentum, he might easily regain it again — for instance, if he performs well at the next debate on Thursday. ||||| 7 years ago Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) - One day before the final GOP presidential debate in Florida, it's all tied up between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, according to a new survey. A CNN/Time/ORC International Poll also indicates that while Gingrich surged following his 12-point victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary, his momentum appears to be quickly cooling off. CNN LIVE: Tune in Thursday at 8 p.m. ET for the CNN/Republican Party of Florida Debate hosted by Wolf Blitzer and follow it on Twitter at #CNNDebate. For real-time coverage of the Florida primary, go to CNNPolitics.com or to the CNN apps or CNN mobile web site. Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @politicalticker According to the poll, 36% of people likely to vote in Tuesday's Republican primary in the Sunshine State say they are backing Romney as the party's nominee, with 34% supporting Gingrich. The former Massachusetts governor's two point margin over the former House speaker is well within the survey's sampling error. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania is at 11% and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas is at 9%, with 7% unsure. The poll's Wednesday release comes one day before a CNN-Republican Party of Florida presidential debate at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. The showdown is the last time the candidates will face off on the same stage before Tuesday's winner-take-all primary, where 50 delegates are up for grabs. \\"In the wake of his double-digit victory in the South Carolina primary, Newt Gingrich has nearly doubled his support in Florida,\\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \\"The current numbers are the result of some wild swings for and against the two frontrunners.\\" Gingrich was at 18% support in Florida and trailed Romney by 25 points in CNN's last poll in the state, which was conducted Jan. 13-17. The new survey was conducted Sunday through Tuesday, after the Palmetto State primary, and mostly before and partially after Monday night's Republican presidential debate in Tampa, where in a role reversal, Romney aggressively attacked Gingrich. On Sunday, the day after Gingrich won big in South Carolina, he was at 38% in Florida, with Romney at 36%, Santorum at 11% and Paul at 8%. Looking only at Monday and Tuesday's results, Romney was at 38%, Gingrich 29% Santorum at 11% and Paul at 9%. \\"Gingrich's post-Palmetto State bounce did not last long,\\" adds Holland. \\"Monday's debate may have something to do with that, but the data indicate that the shift to Romney began before the debate started, so there are clearly other forces at work.\\" The poll indicates that Gingrich has a 10-point lead over Romney among self-described conservatives and appears to do better than Romney among born-again Christians and tea party movement supporters. The geography of the state appears to back that up - Gingrich does five points better than Romney in the more conservative northern and central parts of Florida; Romney does better in Tampa Bay, Miami, and southern Florida, where moderates and northern transplants are more prevalent. A gender gap appears to have developed as well. In South Carolina, Gingrich won among men and women, according to exit polls. But in Florida, although Gingrich has an edge among men, Romney had the advantage among women. \\"Some of that may be due to recent coverage of Gingrich's personal life, but it is almost certainly due to other factors as well. Gingrich's favorable rating has consistently been higher among men than among women for years before he became a presidential candidate, suggesting that men may find his red-meat approach to issues more appealing than women do,\\" says Holland. With six days to go until Florida's GOP primary, which is only open to registered Republicans, one in four questioned said they may change their minds on which candidate they are supporting, while 64% said they are definitely sticking with the candidate they are currently backing. The CNN/Time poll was conducted by ORC International from January 22-24, with 369 likely Florida GOP primary voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points.

If you hold to the notion that this country is evil and that the terrorists are just poor misguided souls that have been pushed to the extreme by this country, then you might enjoy reading this book. I, personally, found it distasteful and offensive. I do not appreciate a writer who foists his political viewpoints off on a purchasing public in the guise of fiction.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Germany\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because Bavaria is a region located in Germany. Disco, which is a type of dance and music genre, can be enjoyed in various settings such as clubs, parties, or events. So, it is likely that a person would dance to disco in a Bavarian town as it falls within the territory of Germany. The other possible answers do not directly relate to the geographical context of the question: 1. \\"Town\\" is not specific enough and doesn't indicate any connection with Bavarian towns or Germany. 2. \\"Rio de Janeiro\\" refers to a city in Brazil, which is not related to Bavaria or Germany. 3. \\"Dance dance dance\\" is a repetitive phrase, and while it implies dancing, it doesn't provide any relevant location information. 4. \\"Hotel\\" could be relevant if you were referring to a disco event at a hotel in a Bavarian town.

Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. Ted and Larry studied environmental sciences. They are learning about greenhouse gasses this week. Ted reads about carbon dioxide, while Larry reads about methane gas. Which student read less about anthropogenic emissions? The answer is:","completion":"Larry read less about anthropogenic emissions. To elaborate, in the given context, we understand that anthropogenic emissions primarily stem from the use of fossil fuels and deforestation. These processes contribute significantly to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, which is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas. Since Ted is reading about carbon dioxide, he is directly learning about anthropogenic emissions and their impact on global warming and ocean acidification. On the other hand, Larry is reading about methane (CH4), another potent greenhouse gas. While methane does have anthropogenic sources, such as livestock farming, landfills, and fossil fuels, the information indicates that carbon dioxide is the primary driver behind increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere due to human activities. As a result, Larry's focus on methane would lead him to read less about anthropogenic emissions in comparison to Ted, who concentrates on carbon dioxide and its direct link to the rapid increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations caused by human activities since the Industrial Revolution."},{"prompt":"Information: - Bogislaw X of Pomerania, \\"the Great\\", (3 June 1454 5 October 1523) was Duke of Pomerania from 1474 until his death in 1523. - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

Does \\"It also took part in the bombing over Britain.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"What was the Luftwaffe's second primary policy?\\"","completion":"The statement \\"It also took part in the bombing over Britain\\" provides information about the Luftwaffe's actions, but it does not specifically mention or define the second primary policy of the Luftwaffe. To understand if this statement contains the correct answer to the question, we need to examine more about the Luftwaffe and its primary policies. The Luftwaffe was the air force of Nazi Germany and played a significant role during World War II. It was involved in several operations, strategies, and tactics in the war. Its primary policies and objectives can be classified into different categories based on the stage of the war and the goals of the German High Command. 1. Early War In the initial stages of World War II, the Luftwaffe primarily focused on enabling and supporting the German army's fast-paced territorial conquests with a strategy known as \\"Blitzkrieg\\" (lightning war). This involved leveraging quick surprise attacks, rapid troop movements, and air superiority to overwhelm enemy defenses. 2. Battle of Britain The second primary policy of the Luftwaffe became more evident during the Battle of Britain (1940), which aimed at achieving air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF) and enabling an invasion of Britain by land or sea (Operation Sea Lion). Although the battle evolved into a strategic bombing campaign targeting Britain's air defenses, industrial centers, and civilian population, the overall goal remained the same: to force Britain into submission or negotiate a peace settlement on Germany's terms. In this context, the statement \\"It also took part in the bombing over Britain\\" accurately describes an important aspect of the Luftwaffe's second primary policy, which was the strategic bombing campaign and targeting of British infrastructure. However, it does not capture the broader objective of achieving air superiority over the RAF and facilitating invasion plans. A more comprehensive answer to \\"What was the Luftwaffe's second primary policy?\\" would be: The Luftwaffe's second primary policy was to achieve air superiority over the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain in order to enable a possible invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion) or force Britain into submission through strategic bombing targeting air defenses, industrial centers, and civilian population."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people.

Movie title: Dead Snow Movie plot: The movie opens with a woman (Ane Dahl Torp) being chased through the snows of Norway. She is finally cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II German uniforms.The movie then moves to seven medical students on Easter vacation. They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her. He finds the body of the hiker in his tent, but then falls through snow into a cave below.The other students find an old wooden box filled with valuables and German decorations hidden under the floor. They consider taking and selling it, but eventually put it back, although some of them keep items. After it gets dark, one of the students, Chris (Jenny Skavlan), goes to the outhouse, but is murdered while on the toilet. The others go outside to look for her; they do not find her, but do find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow.A little later, Chris's severed head... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Dead Snow\\", Vegard is bitten by the zombie when he falls through the snow into a cave while searching for his girlfriend, Sara. After discovering the hiker's body, Vegard accidentally falls into the cave, where he encounters the undead Nazis. It is during this encounter that he gets bitten by one of the zombies, which leads to further consequences in the plot of the film. \\"Dead Snow\\" is a horror-comedy film that brings a unique mix of humor, gore, and suspense together. The zombie theme, combined with the historical aspect of World War II Nazis, adds another layer of intrigue and horror to the story. The movie utilizes the remote, snowy Norwegian landscape to create a chilling and atmospheric setting, which adds to the overall tension and eeriness of the film. Investing in a film proposal can be a risky business, and it usually depends on various factors, such as the target audience, genre, marketability, and potential return on investment. When it comes to investing in \\"Dead Snow\\", there are a few points to consider: 1. Target audience: \\"Dead Snow\\" is aimed primarily at horror and comedy enthusiasts who enjoy zombie movies. While not a mainstream film, it has its niche and a dedicated fan base that could make it a profitable venture. 2. Genre: As a horror-comedy film, \\"Dead Snow\\" offers a unique combination of elements that allow it to appeal to fans of both genres. Horror movies, in general, tend to have a faithful audience that is always eager for new content. The addition of comedy broadens the film's appeal, providing a lighter and more entertaining experience for viewers. 3. Marketability: The snowy Norwegian landscape, the undead Nazi zombies, and the infusion of comedy into the horror genre can make \\"Dead Snow\\" a marketable film. It has strong visual elements, a unique premise, and a darkly comic twist that differentiates it from other zombie movies. 4. Potential Return on Investment: \\"Dead Snow\\" was initially released in 2009 and gained a cult following. Due to its positive reception, a sequel called \\"Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead\\" was released in 2014, which further expanded the film's universe and fan base. The sequel's existence suggests the film has potential for profitability and continued interest from the audience. Taking all these points into consideration, it's crucial to evaluate the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in this film proposal. While \\"Dead Snow\\" has its niche market and loyal fan base, it may not have the same mass appeal as other mainstream films. However, if the proposal's budget, marketing strategy, and distribution plan align with your investment goals and risk tolerance, it could be worth considering."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward \\"Behind the Music\\" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from \\"Animal Farm.\\" The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour. The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story. This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face. There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.)

There are a number of reasons that would motivate her to do this, and this action can be viewed from different perspectives. 1. Building relationships: By providing cookies for her daughter's class, Addison is nurturing relationships not just between her and her daughter, but also between herself and her daughter's classmates. When people share food, it can create a sense of camaraderie and bring them closer together, leading to the development of closer friendships and a stronger sense of community. 2. Encouraging social interaction: Sharing cookies with her daughter's class can serve as a catalyst for social interaction among the children. It encourages them to enjoy a shared experience and have conversations, which can help with their social development and create lasting memories among friends. 3. Supporting her daughter: Addison's act of making cookies for her daughter's class also demonstrates a great deal of support for her child. It shows that she is invested in her daughter's happiness and well-being and is willing to go the extra mile to make her child feel special. This kind of support can greatly boost a child's confidence and self-esteem. 4. Involvement in her daughter's education: By making cookies for her daughter's class, Addison is also getting involved in her daughter's educational experience. This active engagement shows that she values education and wants to be a part of her daughter's learning journey. Teachers and school administrators often appreciate when parents are involved in their children's education, as this engagement can lead to better academic outcomes. 5. Demonstrating creativity and skill: Making a batch of cookies requires creativity and skill, especially if Addison has tried out a new recipe or put her own twist on a classic. By sharing her creation with her daughter's class, she is showcasing her abilities and inspiring her daughter and her classmates to explore their own interests and talents. 6. Promoting a positive classroom environment: The act of bringing and sharing cookies can create a positive and uplifting atmosphere within the classroom. This simple gesture contributes to the morale of everyone in the class and can even inspire other parents to take part in similar activities. In conclusion, while Addison's main reason for making cookies for her daughter's class might not be explicitly stated, it is evident that there are multiple motivations and benefits behind her actions. Her decision to make cookies reflects her love and support for her daughter and her willingness to make an effort to contribute to a welcoming and positive class environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Vikings opened their 2015 season on the road against the San Francisco 49ers. Despite allowing San Francisco to start with the ball, the Vikings made a positive start, as Andrew Sendejo blocked a 28-yard field goal attempt from Phil Dawson, which Marcus Sherels returned 44 yards to the San Francisco 26-yard line. Minnesota QB Teddy Bridgewater was unable to complete a single pass on the next drive, forcing Blair Walsh to attempt a 44-yard field goal; however, he pushed it wide right. After forcing the 49ers to punt on the next series, the Vikings were themselves forced to punt immediately afterwards, only for the 49ers' rookie former rugby league star Jarryd Hayne to muff the catch, allowing the Vikings to recover the ball. The next drive saw the Vikings attempt to convert on 4th-and-3, but Bridgewater's completed pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph fell a yard short of a fresh set of downs. Both sides exchanged punts at the start of the second quarter, with the 49ers eventually returning one 85 yards for a touchdown, only for it to be called back for an illegal block by a San Francisco player. However, the ensuing possession would end with a 49ers touchdown, as they drove 93 yards in just under 5 minutes, before Carlos Hyde finished the series with a 10-yard touchdown run; after finding nowhere to go on his initial run to the right, he beat a Minnesota defender with a spin move and ran back to the left side of the field, where quarterback Colin Kaepernick led him into the end zone. With the Vikings unable to score in the remaining 47 seconds, the first half ended 7-0 to San Francisco. Minnesota started the third quarter with the ball, but they were unable to make it out of their half before being forced to punt. The 49ers then extended their lead on the ensuing possession, driving 73 yards to the Minnesota 11-yard line to set up a 30-yard field goal attempt for Dawson. The Vikings finally got on the scoreboard early in the fourth quarter, as Walsh finished off a 66-yard drive with a 37-yard field goal, but the 49ers pulled further ahead with a second touchdown for Hyde on a 17-yard run. Bridgewater attempted to spark the Vikings back into the game, but a deep pass intended for Rudolph was intercepted by Tramaine Brock, setting up a 25-yard field goal for Dawson. The next drive saw the Vikings go for it again on 4th-and-8, but Bridgewater was sacked for a loss of 14 yards, allowing the 49ers to kneel out the game.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that {insert demonic music here} there is a fourth. I didn't expect much from it, and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you're into watching bad movies for a laugh, then this just may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start? From the onset, the \\"made for TV\\" look and feel of the movie was obvious. The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore (at best) distracting. The script had all the suspense of an 8 year-olds work of fiction. But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting. Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness. The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted out by wrong-doing and badly acted nuns. There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the \\"drama\\" unfolded, and the usual third-party investigator into the whole affair. Later, via some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born. And that pretty much wraps up the plot. The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and/or ridiculous scene after another. There were many WTF?!? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief. For example, what's with the major over-reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek?? Hardly a 360-degree-head-turning omen. I also laughed at the over-reaction at the baptism. The baby cries, and everyone looks very concerned. The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself. Huh? Then there is the new-age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year-old to all kind of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it. \\"Yeah that's groovy, fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this mysticism stuff. That's cool. I don't need to be there.\\" Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack. The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way, from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the ensuing inferno. I also laughed at how the nun's death is considered a \\"freak accident\\". Here we have a religious zealot, (who is described as being part of a cult), who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how God's Glory will protect them. She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times. Hardly a freak accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. The snakes-vs-nun scene wasn't the only comical death. There is the slow-speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot. Then there is the slow-motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective. I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slow-motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the \\"concerned\\" detective. Then there is the quintessential who-shot-who cliché death, where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances. Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was. Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently something demonic was happening, as this is what the music was suggesting. Ummm. OK. I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particularly, as a \\"worthy sequel\\". It is difficult not to notice the non-sensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score. The movie lacks any suspense, relying heavily on Delia's \\"demonic stare\\" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short time. Bottom line : This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's unintended potential for being a comedy.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is largely negative. The reviewer points out numerous criticisms and flaws with the movie, such as a poorly written script, lack of suspense, bad acting, and issues with the music score.

Make this lower case","completion":"a collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 when he was preparing the first publication of his works under the common title the third testament. In this collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts, the reader can find a treasure trove of wisdom and insights by the renowned Danish spiritual author and philosopher, Martinus Thomsen, more commonly known as Martinus. Spanning over a decade from the 1970s until his death in 1981, these manuscripts showcase the series of works that Martinus had envisioned and planned to publish as a unified body of knowledge under the title, The Third Testament. The Third Testament was meant to stand as a monumental work that would build upon the ideas and teachings of the Old and New Testaments, adding a modern understanding of spirituality and cosmology to the mix. Martinus, who was deeply inspired by the spiritual awakening he experienced in 1921, used his intuitive and extraordinary insight to probe into the mysteries of life and uncover the principles driving the evolution of the universe and consciousness. In his writing, Martinus tackled various themes such as love, morality, death, karma, and the purpose of human existence. A writer par excellence, he was well-known for his ability to explain complex and abstract concepts in a language that was accessible and easy to understand for the lay reader. His vision of a world united by spiritual understanding, transcending barriers of religion, race, and nationality, has inspired countless individuals seeking to connect with their inner selves and the divine power that pervades all creation. The manuscripts in this collection offer a unique opportunity to explore Martinus' groundbreaking thoughts and ideas that were yet to be fully actualized at the time of his death in 1981. As these works were not completed, they may not exhibit the same level of refinement or organization as his published works. However, their raw and unvarnished nature lends them an authenticity and depth that reveal Martinus' innermost thought processes, intellectual struggles, and spiritual breakthroughs in a manner that may not be evident in his polished final works. For individuals already familiar with the works of Martinus, these manuscripts can be seen as complementary to his other well-known publications, including \\"Livets Bog\\" (The Book of Life), \\"Bisættelse\\" (Funeral Rites), and \\"Menneskehedens Skæbne\\" (The Fate of Mankind). By delving into these unpublished manuscripts, readers can enhance their understanding of Martinus' teachings and further appreciate the profound wisdom that he sought to impart through his life's work. In conclusion, this trove of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by Martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 offers a remarkable glimpse into the mind of a deeply spiritual individual and philosopher who had devoted his life to unraveling the mysteries of existence. By exploring these works and seeking to understand the ideas presented within them, readers may find new pathways to spiritual understanding, personal growth, and ultimately, the divine essence within themselves and the universe at large."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"\\"House\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a place where people generally feel comfortable, safe, and relaxed, making it a suitable environment for playing board games. Houses typically provide enough space to set up board games, with areas such as living rooms, dining rooms, or even bedrooms being utilized for such recreational activities, depending on the personal preferences of the inhabitants. Furthermore, playing board games at home often allows for easy access to the game components and enables family members or friends to gather and engage in the activity. The home setting is also conducive to impromptu gaming sessions, as there is no need to transport game materials or reserve a location beforehand. In contrast, the other options listed as possible answers may not be relevant or practical for playing board games. A shelf is simply a place to store items, a toy store is a retail business for purchasing games, and a shelter usually implies a temporary living space where one might not have the luxury of playing games.

Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Movie title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Context: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

Answer:","completion":"To determine the validity of the answer \\"feeling passive,\\" let's first analyze the situation and Ash's actions: 1. Bailey was telling mean lies about Ash, which indicates that Bailey was presumably speaking negatively and deceptively about Ash. 2. Ash smacked Bailey's lips, an act that suggests Ash took a physical approach to confront Bailey's behavior. Based on these observations, we can conclude that Ash is more likely to be described as reactive or assertive, rather than passive, as they took immediate action to halt Bailey's negative comments.

These artist-facilitators operate under collective principles, driving the community-centered environment that comprises Hausmania. This place appears to be an active platform for avant-garde art, providing substantial backing and infrastructure for experimental and innovative artistic initiatives. As per the given context, Kafe Hærverk is identified as an experimental music venue and is mentioned as \\"next door\\" to Hausmania. This phrase \\"next door\\" generally signifies that two places are neighbours or adjacently located, in this case implying that Kafe Hærverk and Hausmania share a boundary or are in very close proximity to each other without any separation by other buildings or structures. Therefore, taking the given description together, we can infer with a high degree of certainty that Kafe Hærverk, the experimental music venue, is indeed located next to Hausmania. Its close proximity allows for an interesting intersection of cultural and musical exchanges, showcasing the dynamism and vitality of the underground artistic scene in Oslo. However, for more precise information regarding the distance, layout, and connection between the two establishments, it would be useful to refer to a map or contact the establishments directly.

If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water. Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast. If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor. Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast. If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time. Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well. Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the \\"gamey\\" taste of a deer roast. If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however. Cover the slow cooker and switch it to low. A thawed roast should take about 8 hours, but a frozen or partially frozen roast will need a full 10 hours. Alternatively, you could switch the slow cooker on high and leave it for 6 hours.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the types of whales that use throat pleats to expand the mouth? , can you please find it? Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, baleen whales, belonging to the parvorder Mysticeti, use throat pleats to expand their mouths. This adaptation allows them to take in massive gulps of water while feeding on krill and plankton. Among the baleen whales, the families that exhibit this characteristic consist of: 1. Balaenopteridae (Rorquals): This family includes species such as the blue whale, humpback whale, fin whale, sei whale, Bryde's whale, minke whale, and the common minke whale. Many of these whales are known for their gigantic size and streamlined appearance. 2. Balaenidae (Right Whales): This family includes species such as the North Atlantic right whale, North Pacific right whale, southern right whale, and the bowhead whale. Right whales are known for their massive heads, which can make up 40% of their body mass, helping them take in large volumes of water during feeding. 3. Cetotheriidae (Pygmy Right Whale): This is a relatively small baleen whale with a unique feature of having a dorsal fin. Only one extant species is found in this family – the pygmy right whale – which is also known for having throat pleats. 4. Eschrichtiidae (Grey Whale): This family consists of only one extant species – the grey whale – known for its unique feeding behavior and for having throat pleats. To sum up, baleen whales, including the families Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), utilize throat pleats to expand their mouths while feeding on vast amounts of water containing krill and plankton. This distinctive feature sets them apart from toothed whales, which have conical teeth adapted for catching fish and squid instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. CÃ©sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one...

Write an article based on this \\"An Indian government resource kit on adolescent health has received acclaim because of its progressive stance on sexuality.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: India's Progressive Government Resource Kit on Adolescent Health Receives Global Acclaim Introduction: In a society where discussing sexuality is still considered a taboo, the Indian Government has taken a noteworthy step forward by introducing a progressive resource kit on adolescent health. Championing a more inclusive and liberal outlook towards adolescent sexuality, this kit has received praise from both national and international platforms. Not only does this initiative challenge the widespread disapproval of discussing subjects like sex education, sexual and reproductive health, and LGBTQ+ issues, but it also underscores the significance of creating an informed and empowered youth population. Understanding the Resource Kit: The Indian Government, in association with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has developed a comprehensive and modern approach to adolescent health education. This resource kit is primarily focused on addressing the numerous challenges faced by teenagers and young adults, including tackling physical, emotional, and sexual health issues. One of the highlights of this resource kit is its progressive stance on sexuality. In previous years, any discussion on this topic was often ignored or addressed with misinformation, potentially resulting in several physical and mental health issues among the younger population. However, this new resource demonstrates a shift in the mindset of government authorities, reflecting a more inclusive, informative, and open-minded approach to discussing these sensitive yet crucial topics. Discussing Sexuality without Prejudice: Possibly the most remarkable aspect of this resource kit is its considerate and unprejudiced approach towards sexuality. It not only advocates for an individual's right to identify and express gender and sexual orientation, but also emphasizes the importance of sexual consent and personal boundaries. The kit can play a critical role in building a healthy and well-informed society free from sexual prejudices and unfounded notions. Educating the educators on sensitive topics: While providing information to adolescents is crucial, the success of this resource kit also relies on the ability of educators to address sensitive topics with comfort and understanding. Teachers, healthcare professionals, and community influencers are encouraged to discuss these subjects in a culturally suitable and responsible manner. This progressive resource kit includes effective tools and materials to support these professionals, facilitating communication and fostering a healthy dialogue around sexual education in the country. Enhancing Inclusivity: Committed to building an inclusive society, this innovative government resource kit goes beyond the conventional discussions of male and female sexual health to talk about the broad spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities. By acknowledging the LGBTQ+ community and the challenges they face, the kit takes steps to promote acceptance and reduce discrimination. Such an initiative sets a remarkable example for other countries to emulate in terms of promoting diversity and embracing every individual's right to sexual health and education. Taking the lead in SRHR commitments: With this progressive resource kit, India takes a significant leap in its commitment to upholding sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). By giving these rights the importance they deserve, the country can take a multi-dimensional approach that addresses diverse areas like gender equality, adolescent health, family planning, and general public health. Eliminating Stigmas and Myths: One of the primary goals of this comprehensive resource kit is to debunk the myths and misperceptions surrounding adolescent sexuality. By offering factual and sensitive content, the kit strives to eliminate the stigma that generally accompanies discussions on sexuality. The more well-informed youngsters become, the better equipped they are to make educated decisions about their sexual health and emotional wellbeing. Conclusion: India's progressive government resource kit on adolescent health has made a significant mark on the global stage due to its inclusive and well-rounded approach to sexuality. As the world acknowledges and appreciates this groundbreaking initiative, it also creates an opportunity for other nations to re-evaluate their own adolescent health education policies and adopt similar inclusive strategies. By dismantling conventional sexual taboos and promoting honest dialogue, it is possible to build a society that recognizes the importance of comprehensive and accurate sexual education for the well-being and development of the next generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My steps are as follows: 1. Understand the given information: The increased penetration of personal computing technology at the household level suggests that more households have access to and are using personal computing technology. 2. Define key terms: Personal computing technology typically refers to devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Household level refers to individual homes and families. 3. Analyzing the statement: The statement claims that there has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing devices in households. This would mean that fewer households are using personal computing technology. 4. Compare the statement to the given information: The given information states that there has been an increase in the penetration (usage) of personal computing technology at the household level. This is contradictory to the statement, which claims that there has been a sharp decline in the usage of personal computing technology in households. 5.

Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform. They stress the regime's achievements in combating homelessness and ensuring access to food and safe drinking water. Highlighting that under Gaddafi, all Libyans enjoyed free education to a university level, they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution. Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans \\"undoubtedly changed for the better\\" as material conditions and wealth drastically improved, while Libyan studies specialist Lillian Craig Harris remarked that in the early years of his administration, Libya's \\"national wealth and international influence soared, and its national standard of living has risen dramatically.\\" Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of economic stagnation. Gaddafi claimed that his Jamahiriya was a \\"concrete utopia\\", and that he had been appointed by \\"popular assent\\", with some Islamic supporters believing that he exhibited barakah. His opposition to Western governments earned him the respect of many in the Euro-American far right. What was the cost of primary and secondary education under Gaddafi?","completion":"Under Gaddafi's rule, primary and secondary education in Libya was free for all citizens. After the 1969 revolution, the Gaddafi regime emphasized the importance of education and made significant efforts to improve the education system in the country. This focus on education contributed to a dramatic increase in literacy rates and expanded opportunities for many Libyans. Not only did the government cover the cost of primary and secondary education, but it also provided free education up to the university level for all Libyan citizens. This was in line with Gaddafi's vision for creating an educated and self-reliant society. By providing free education, the regime aimed to promote social mobility and give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute to the nation's development. In summary, the cost of primary and secondary education under Gaddafi's rule was entirely covered by the state, making education free and accessible to Libyan citizens during that time. This commitment to education played a significant role in improving the overall standard of living in Libya, particularly during the early years of Gaddafi's leadership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. communication B. fun C. understood D. ease tension E. suffering The best answer is","completion":"C. understood Expressing oneself effectively and genuinely is crucial to being understood by others. While all the given options are related to communication and personal expression in some way, \\"understood\\" directly ties into the concept of successfully conveying one's thoughts, feelings, and ideas to another individual or group. The ability to clearly express oneself ensures that there is little room for misinterpretation or confusion. A. Communication Effective communication is a vital part of human interaction, and expressing yourself is one aspect of it. However, communication encompasses more than personal expression. It also includes active listening, adjusting language for your audience, and interpreting the nonverbal cues of others. B. Fun Expressing oneself can certainly be an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Creative outlets like art, dance, and music often provide opportunities for fun and self-expression. While this is a valid answer, it is not the primary goal of expressing oneself in the context of communication and interpersonal relationships. D. Ease tension Expression may help to ease tension in certain situations, such as when misunderstandings occur or emotions run high. Clearly expressing your feelings and thoughts can clarify your intentions, alleviate misconceptions, and pave the way for resolution. However, this answer is somewhat situational and may not apply to all expressions or contexts. E. Suffering Expressing oneself can indeed be cathartic and healing in times of suffering, providing an essential outlet for emotions and thoughts that might otherwise remain bottled up. This can have positive impacts on mental health and well-being. While this aspect of expression is valuable and important, it does not embody the broader idea of being understood, which encompasses various types of expressions, emotions, and situations. In summary, the best answer is \\"C. understood\\" because personal expression specifically aims to convey one's inner thoughts and feelings accurately and clearly to foster understanding, connection, and empathy in relationships. While communication, fun, easing tension, and suffering may all be related to the topic, the core purpose behind expressing oneself lies in the desire to be understood by others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

The Cranberries are an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989 by lead singer Niall Quinn, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, and drummer Fergal Lawler. Quinn was replaced as lead singer by Dolores O'Riordan in 1990. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk, and pop rock elements. The Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album A new acoustic Cranberries album titled Something Else was released on 28 April 2017, through BMG. Something Else featured orchestral arrangements of prior releases, and three new songs. With the release of the new album, the group announced a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the European tour, The Cranberries had to cancel the remainder of the European dates due to O'Riordan's health, with the band's website citing \\"medical reasons associated with a back problem\\". The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed enough for her to participate. On 15 January 2018, O'Riordan died unexpectedly in London, England. The inquest into her death was adjourned until 3 April 2018 while the coroner awaits the results of \\"various tests\\". On 7 March 2018, the band announced they were releasing a special 25th anniversary newly remastered anniversary edition of the debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We, with previously unreleased material as well as other bonus material from the era of the album. However, with O'Riordan's death it was delayed until late 2018. The band also decided to complete their new album underway at the time O'Riordan died, for which she had already recorded the vocals.

Here is a news article: Joel Bennett, an attorney for a woman who accused Herman Cain of sexual harassment while both worked at the National Restaurant Association, hands out statements during a news conference outside his office in Washington, Friday, Nov. 4, 2011. Republican presidential candidate and former National Restaurant Association boss Herman Cain participates in a recent discussion about his 9-9-9 tax plan. Herman Cain dodged a bullet Thursday as one of his sex assault accusers, Karen Kraushaar, said she won't be telling her full tale unless the three other accusers join her. \\"Ms. Kraushaar has decided not to hold a press conference unless and until the other women come forward and wish to participate,\\" her lawyer Joel Bennett said in a statement released Thursday. Two of the four women have not responded to Kraushaar's outreach. While the former National Restaurant Association employee thanked Sharon Bialek for coming forward with her story, Kraushaar \\"believes it would be more meaningful to have all four women present and participating,\\" Bennett said. Neither Kraushaar nor Bennett will be making any more statements unless a joint press conference is held. Earlier in the day, Bennett had said Cain would be up to his chin in lies if Kraushaar went public. Cain's claim that all he did was point to his chin and tell Kraushaar she was as tall as his wife is nowhere in the complaint Kraushaar leveled against him, according to Bennett. \\"I have read my clients' written complaint,\\" Bennett told the Daily News. \\"The incidents were not about how tall she was or that she was wearing a nice dress or anything along those lines. \\"It was sexual harassment, not something innocent or something that could have been misconstrued.\\" Nothing about the abuse Kraushaar claims to have suffered at the hands of Cain more than a decade ago is \\"minor,\\" he said. \\"My client is an intelligent, well-educated woman who knows the difference between a compliment and sexual harassment,\\" Bennett added. He unloaded on Cain a day after the pizza baron's GOP rivals avoided the sexually-charged subject during a Michigan debate. But Cain supporters and conservative commentators were already hitting back hard on Kraushaar, as a woman with a penchant for bringing formal complaints, and Bialek as a woman with financial problems who was looking for a payday, charges Bialek has denied. Cain has denied harassing any of the four women who have accused him of being a pig - but admitted remembering Kraushaar, who worked for him when he ran the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain said all he remembers doing was point to his chin and tell Kraushaar she was as tall as his wife, Gloria. Kraushaar, who is now a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office in the U.S. Treasury Department, and another woman received five-figure settlements from the restaurant association. She later filed complaints against another supervisor at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which Bennett said \\"are totally irrelevant and of no concern\\" in the Cain case. Cain, however, claims to have no memory at all of Bialek, the first woman to unmask herself as one of his alleged victims. On Monday Bialek claimed Cain shoved a hand up her skirt and tried to force her head down on his crotch after she asked for help finding a job. While Cain has spoken darkly of a \\"Democratic machine\\" being behind the accusations, both Bialek and Kraushaar are Republicans. csiemaszko@nydailynews.com ||||| WASHINGTON — The lawyer for one of the women who have accused Herman Cain of sexually harassing them in the late 1990s said Thursday afternoon that she has been unable to coordinate a joint press conference with three other women who have made similar accusations. Joel P. Bennett, who represents Karen Kraushaar, said that his client does not intend to talk to the news media or to authorize him to talk further, until — and unless — the other women agree to come forward together to present what she said would be “a body of evidence” of Mr. Cain’s alleged misdeeds. “She will have no further comment until that time, and she and I will not be granting any interviews to the media before any such press conference,” Mr. Bennett told reporters during a brief news conference outside his Georgetown office here. The announcement would appear to buy Mr. Cain some breathing space in what had been an 11-day string of news reports about allegations that he sexually harassed employees at the National Restaurant Association and one of its nonprofit offshoots when he was its chief executive. Since news of the accusations broke on Politico.com on Oct. 30, Mr. Cain has faced a relentless stream of reports about his encounters with the women, all of which he has strenuously denied. Ms. Kraushaar initially said on Tuesday that she wanted to reach out to the three other women who said Mr. Cain had harassed them. The idea, she said at the time, was to hold a joint news conference to spell out the details of their experiences. There would be comfort in numbers, she suggested. But Mr. Bennett said that despite “diligent efforts,” Ms. Kraushaar has been unable to speak with two of the three women, both of whom have remained anonymous throughout the last two weeks. Another accuser, Sharon Bialek, was the first to step forward and place a face and a name to allegations against Mr. Cain. She did so at a news briefing on Monday at which she accused Mr. Cain of making a rough physical advance on her as he suggested she engage in a sexual encounter in return for his assistance in finding her a new job. Mr. Cain has said he does not know Ms. Bialek. But her decision to step forward contributed to Ms. Kraushaar’s decision to go public the following day, after a week in which she was known publicly only as a former restaurant association employee who had received a 45,000 settlement after accusing Mr. Cain of harassment. But Ms. Kraushaar has yet to provide many details about her accusation, though the restaurant association has loosened the parameters of a confidentiality agreement she signed as part of her settlement. In the days since Ms. Kraushaar suggested a joint press briefing, she and Ms. Bialek have come under intense scrutiny in the news media, amplified by the remarks of highly critical conservative commentators who have rallied to Mr. Cain’s defense. And Mr. Cain has retained a powerful Atlanta lawyer, L. Lin Wood, who has issued stern warnings that he will consider taking legal action against Mr. Cain’s accusers. Ms. Kraushaar has not heard from the two women who have remained anonymous, one of whom received a 35,000 settlement from the restaurant association. She has told friends that she fears the scrutiny and criticism she and Ms. Bialek have received, and Mr. Wood’s warnings have frightened them off from publicly discussing their experiences. She is now said to be hoping that she can at the very least meet with the other women to talk in private and then see if any sort of joint briefing can be arranged. Ms. Bialek’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, has said she would accept Ms. Kraushaar’s invitation to speak jointly. Mr. Bennett had initially said that Ms. Kraushaar would be willing to appear with Ms. Bialek alone. But, speaking at his office here on Thursday, he said that had changed, adding that Ms. Kraushaar now “believes it would be more meaningful to have all four women present and participating.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In 2011, Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain faced allegations of sexual harassment from four women, two of whom received five-figure settlements from the National Restaurant Association where Cain was CEO in the 1990s.

Fact 2: Bighorns have hollow hair that traps body heat. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What do bighorns' hollow hairs do?\\" with the following options: - It helps them survive - Plant growth is reduced - prevent heat loss - share properties - protect them - allow growth - Decrease bodily water - refract or absorb. Answer:","completion":"Bighorns' hollow hairs play a crucial role in their survival and protection against harsh environmental conditions. These specialized hairs act as efficient insulators, helping bighorns prevent heat loss from their bodies. By trapping body heat within the hollow structure of the hair, bighorns are able to maintain their body temperature and conserve energy that they would otherwise have to expend to generate heat. Adaptations like hollow hairs are particularly important for bighorns since they inhabit regions with extreme temperature fluctuations, such as high-altitude mountain ranges and arid deserts. Their hollow hairs serve as an essential biological adaptation that enables them to withstand these challenging environmental conditions, providing an insulative barrier to help maintain their core body temperature.

Q: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Watching \\"Ossessione\\" today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience, especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how Italian filmmakers changed movies forever (roughly from \\"Ossessione\\" and De Sica's \\"I Bambini Ci Guardano\\", both 1943, up to 20 years later with Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini). Visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" as a guide to the development of his own themes. It strikes us even today how ahead of its time \\"Ossessione\\" was. Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn't help. \\"Ossessione\\" alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time Italy (far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist \\"Telefoni Bianchi\\" movies); but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk Gino (Massimo Girotti, who definitely precedes Brando's Kowalski in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\") taking Giovanna (Clara Calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. We watch Calamai's unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike Pierre Clémenti's, who was shot by the Nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...In a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in Italian cinema. All the copies of \\"Ossessione\\" were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the Neo-Realist movement, preceding Rossellini's \\"Roma CIttà Aperta\\" and De Sica's \\"Sciuscià\\". Some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw \\"Ossessione\\" as the Italian counterpart to the \\"poetic realism\\" of French cinema (remember Visconti had been Renoir's assistant), especially Marcel Carné's \\"Quai des Brumes\\" and \\"Le Jour se Lève\\", and Julien Duvivier's \\"Pépé le Moko\\". While \\"Ossessione\\" may be Neo-Realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, \\"everyday- life\\" characters and themes, favored by DeSica and Rossellini. In \\"Ossessione\\" we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially \\"Senso\\" (Visconti's definitive departure from Neo-Realist aesthetics) and \\"Rocco e Suoi Fratelli\\"...Even in his most \\"Neo-Realist\\" film, \\"La Terra Trema\\", he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures. \\"Ossessione\\" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. \\"Ossessione\\" is not to be missed: you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.

Sometimes, political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion are the reason for others parties' failure. Sometimes, typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition, it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using patronage and sometimes by voting fraud. In the latter case, the definition between dominant and one-party system becomes rather blurred.

The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system.

Summarize this article: Couple try to be first to row from Monterey to Hawaii Honolulu Monterey Their first date after meeting on Match.com was kayaking in Sausalito. Their second get-together was a trail run in the Marin Headlands that lasted for three hours because neither would admit to fatigue. And for their first overnight trip, the two climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. Tech entrepreneurs and endurance athletes Sami Inkinen, 38, and Meredith Loring, 34, hope to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary as the first couple to row from California to Hawaii. In coming days, the San Anselmo residents - he is a co-founder of the real estate search and information site Trulia - will set off on a 2,400-mile journey from Monterey to Oahu.

In 1976, Patrick Quesnel rowed from Washington state to Hawaii, and was followed in the 1980s by British racer Peter Bird. In 2008, Roz Savage became the first woman to row solo from San Francisco to Oahu in 99 days. \\"People have done things like this,\\" said Ray Dean, rowing commissioner of the San Francisco Dolphin Club. \\"I don't think it's crazy, but it is an aggressive challenge. They will have to deal with weather, navigation, exhaustion, sleep deprivation and each other. The mental strain is hard to imagine. It's like living locked in your car and you can't get out. \\"It's a little boat in a very big ocean.\\" Quest a real test Inkinen and Loring's quest to set a speed record for their row will be a test of mind, body and marriage. \\"I think the biggest threat will be to our relationship,\\" said Loring. \\"It's going to be uncomfortable. We'll be sleep-deprived and hungry and sore, so it will be easier to cross boundaries that we don't want to cross.\\" Inkinen agreed. \\"The mental side is going to be the most challenging. How we deal with ourselves and with each other.\\" The rowing record for this route was set by Mick Bird in 1997 in a time of 64 days. Inkinen (his name is pronounced SAH-me INK-in-en) grew up on a farm in Finland, has a master's degree in engineering physics from Helsinki University of Technology, and worked for a brief period as a radio chemist in a nuclear power plant in Finland. After selling his first wireless software company, Matchem, in 2000, he came to Stanford to earn an MBA, and while there he co-founded Trulia and became a competitive triathlete. Trulia, started in 2005, now has more than 400 employees and reported a record 50 million unique visitors to its site in April. Extreme challenge Inkinen said he was drawn to triathlons because of the challenges of pushing himself to extremes. But he also loved tracking every aspect of his performance, from the quality of his sleep and meditation to his heart rate. The self-professed \\"data geek\\" has become one of the nation's top amateur triathletes in his age group. Loring grew up as a competitive gymnast in New Hampshire, studied economics and psychology at the University of Massachusetts and earned a master's from Babson College. She was a product manager for FactSet Research Systems, which sells software and analytic applications to investment banks, and moved to the company's San Francisco office in 2008. Soon after, she met Inkinen. Loring is a cyclist and runner, and in late May won the women's division of the Mount Everest marathon in Nepal, a race that is billed as the world's highest trail running event. \\"Both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities,\\" said Inkinen of the 2,400-mile row. Weather permitting, the two plan to set out this week from a marina near Monterey Bay Aquarium in their 20-foot-long, 5-foot-wide carbon fiber boat Roosevelt - named for the nation's adventuresome 26th president. The boat weighs 1,400 pounds unloaded, and 2,900 pounds fully loaded with food and gear. It has no engine and no sail, only a sliding seat and muscle power. There will be no support or chase boats, and the Roosevelt is not a part of the inaugural Great Pacific Race, where a dozen teams of rowers left Monterey on June 9 for Hawaii. \\"We have consulted with the Great Pacific Race organizers, but we are doing this as a solo expedition,\\" said Inkinen, who found inspiration in the best-selling book, \\"Unbroken,\\" the story of a World War II bombardier whose plane went down in the Pacific and survived 47 days on a tiny raft. 'Wild of the open ocean' Loring laughed dryly and said, \\"Somehow that was appealing to my husband.\\" \\"After I read the book,\\" Inkinen explained, \\"I realized neither one of us had experienced the wild of the open ocean. Then I started reading other books about what people have encountered on the ocean.\\" Early on in their marriage, the two made a pact to do \\"mental growth experiences\\" together. Loring noted that neither of them had done any rowing before this year. They have since trained at the Sausalito Open Water Rowing Center. Shirwin Smith, general manager of the Sausalito rowing center, has rowed for three decades and would never consider such a journey. \\"The longest I've spent rowing was six hours, and that was in a 35-pound shell, not a heavy boat like Sami and Meredith are going out in,\\" said Smith. \\"But they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way. They were super fit to begin with, but they came here to get the right form. They learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have.\\" She added, \\"I remember how I'd wake up at 6:30 a.m. and I could see the two of them making their way up the shore at the upper end of Richardson Bay. They would be out there for hours.\\" Inkinen acknowledged, \\"We had zero rowing experience when we started. The last six months have been about strengthening specific rowing muscles and just getting used to rowing.\\" The two wanted to use the journey as a way to bring attention to a subject they both feel strongly about: the dangers of sugar. Inkinen was stunned years ago when he learned he was prediabetic. He made a study of what he was eating and found sugar hidden in nearly all processed foods. \\"I had always thought that diabetics were overweight or not active,\\" Inkinen said. \\"But the problem is that sugar is in everything, from bread to ketchup. It's like a poison to your body. That's why we're raising awareness to change this. The ultimate goal is to reverse or eliminate childhood obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\\" Any donations made to their campaign, called Fat Chance Row, will go to Dr. Robert Lustig's nonprofit Institute for Responsible Nutrition at UCSF. Lustig is a professor of pediatrics, a widely known antisugar crusader and author of a book called \\"Fat Chance.\\" Inkinen and Loring - she left FactSet in 2010 - also are launching their own sugar-free, protein-based packaged food called Native Life, not yet on the market. For their row across the Pacific, they plan to bring nuts and dried fish, meat, fruit and vegetables. Sleep in water-tight cabin They will have a desalinator to convert salt water into drinking water, a GPS system, emergency beacons and a radar system to warn other boats of their presence and detect oncoming vessels. The main difference between their boat and a traditional rowboat is that the Roosevelt has a water-tight cabin in one end, for sleeping and taking refuge from storms. The boat, made in England, was designed to right herself when capsized. \\"We just did a training session where we were in the cabin and had the boat capsized,\\" said Inkinen. \\"It was kind of like a merry-go-round motion. You see through the hatch that the ocean is rising above your cabin, though not coming in. It's a little scary, but now that we've gone through it, we know that as long as everything is closed, we will spin back around.\\" Loring added, \\"We've taken a lot of safety precautions. We know that we'll probably flip over at least once during the expedition. When we are on deck, we'll always be tethered to the boat, so if we go overboard, we won't be lost.\\" Taking all the precautions doesn't mean things can't go wrong. Just Wednesday morning, a kayaker on the same journey was stranded when his solar panel (used to charge his equipment) malfunctioned, and he had to be rescued by the Coast Guard. For their trip, Inkinen and Loring plan to take turns in the cabin and up on deck, with one rowing for two hours while the other sleeps for two hours around the clock. They will spend an hour on deck together each day, to reconnect, recap and strategize. They expect to travel about 2 knots per hour on average and reach Hawaii in 60 days. \\"We met in August 2008,\\" Loring said. \\"We married Aug. 20, 2010. Hopefully, we'll finish this before our four-year anniversary.\\" Inkinen said he likes not knowing what lies ahead. \\"I've gone through the pain of Ironman triathlons,\\" he said. \\"I've built a company. It's fun. But it's very stressful. I've faced adversity. I know that no one can make me give up - unless it gets too risky. So I'm confident, but this is a whole new thing. We don't know what the lessons will be.\\" As for the prospects of their marriage being intact when they reach Oahu, Loring said, \\"The fact we are doing this as a couple does make it much more fun. And much more risky.\\" ||||| To test marriage, fight against sugar and break records, we are rowing across the Pacific Ocean, 2400+ miles from San Francisco to Hawaii, completely unsupported. If all goes well and we'll continue rowing non-stop 24x7, we'll finish in about two months after our June 2014 launch. This will hurt and push us to the very limits, but the fight will be worth it.

Tech entrepreneur Sami Inkinen, 38, and his former competitive gymnast wife Meredith Loring, 34, if they complete the grueling feat, will become the first couple to ever successfully make the trip across the mighty Pacific. But short of being scared to undertake a task only ever completed by a handful of adventure seekers, Inkinen and Loring are more afraid of what it may do to their relationship. Ultimate challenge: Sami Inkinen his wife Meredith Loring are pictured training for their Monterrey to Oahu trek across the Pacific in just a row boat 'It's going to be uncomfortable.

Before breakfast, she has typically completed a three-hour run, five-hour bike ride or both. She has completed several multi-day cycling and running stage races both in U.S. and Europe. Meredith’s passionate about spreading the message about real foods based nutrition to the masses. She's also building a healthy packaged food company that has nothing to do with sugar. Her idea of a first over-night date with her now-husband was to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa. Proof of concept: Carried a steel mountain bike around Mt.

During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean. Q: Which ocean ranged the majority of the northern hemisphere in the Silurian period?","completion":"During the Silurian period, the big ocean that covered most of the northern hemisphere was called Panthalassa.

Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Besides making them stronger, why is taking HGH attractive for some athletes? - Because it can be taken during a competition. - Because it is very difficult to test. - Because it is allowed to take it. - Because it works for 24 hours.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Welcome to what may be the most important Republican debate yet, as Mitt Romney tries to hold off Newt Gingrich in the South Carolina primary. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul are also looking to make noise in Saturday's vote. Some highlights: 9:51 p.m. The candidates are asked to make their case for the state of South Carolina. Ron Paul says he'll fight for people's liberty and freedom, while reducing government debt and spending. Newt Gingrich says he can bring \\"dramatic\\" and \\"deep\\" change to Washington, and he can beat President Obama through debates. He calls the incumbent \\"the most dangerous president of our lifetime.\\" Mitt Romney touts his understanding of the country's values, and says \\"this president is changing the very nature of America.\\" Rick Santorum says he is \\"a conviction conservative\\" who will make \\"a clear contrast\\" with Obama. He tells Republicans not to \\"settle for a moderate\\" (Hello, Mitt). 9:43 p.m. Ron Paul, the doctor, also weighs in on abortion. He says it's as much of an issue of morality as of law. Rick Santorum notes that Paul has often voted against the pro-life position. Paul says he wasn't thinking of Santorum when he spoke of abortion policy and tells him: \\"You are overly sensitive.\\" 9:36 p.m. Abortion comes up. Newt Gingrich says he accepts Mitt Romney's statement that he has changed his mind and now opposes abortion rights -- but his health care plan in Massachusetts had abortion provisions and some of his judges were pro-abortion rights. Romney says he doesn't appreciate having his integrity questioned and that Gingrich has distorted \\"Romneycare\\" and other aspects of his record in Massachusetts. \\"I am a pro-life person,\\" he says, and will pursue policies to protect the unborn when he is president. Rick Santorum piles on Romney, charging Romney's health care plan allowed for abortions. Romney notes he was pro-life in a state where \\"that wasn't easy.\\" Tells Santorum, \\"I appreciate your record; I hope you appreciate mine.\\" 9:35 p.m. Newt Gingrich says when he is president that he will drop Justice Department lawsuits against states that have their own anti-immigration laws. 9:25 p.m. An audience member asks the candidates whether they support \\"amnesty\\" for illegal immigrants. Newt Gingrich says he would send more troops to the border and would quicken the pace of deportations, but he also supports a \\"guest worker\\" program for people who have been in the U.S. for a long time. He says illegal immigrants would have to apply and prove they have strong community ties. Mitt Romney says \\"you build a fence\\" with more troops on the border and sanction employers who hire illegal immigrants; says current illegal immigrants, even those who have been here a long time, should go back to their countries and re-apply for residency in the U.S. Rick Santorum notes that Romney once backed \\"a pathway to citizenship,\\" just as Gingrich does now. Santorum says illegal immigrants have broken the law, and shouldn't be rewarded for that. 9:21 p.m. After a break, the candidates are asked their biggest regret. Newt Gingrich says his biggest regret is spending the early months as a \\"traditional\\" candidate, rather than an \\"idea-oriented\\" one. Mitt Romney wishes he had spent less time criticizing his opponents and more time on the \\"failures\\" of President Obama. Also: \\"I would work to get 25 more votes in Iowa. That's for sure.\\" Rick Santorum regrets nothing, saying he's honored to be in the \\"final four.\\" Ron Paul says he would work on his delivery. 9:11 p.m. Newt Gingrich blasts new proposals for new Internet copyright restrictions, saying it amounts to censorship and is being pushed by \\"the left\\" in \\"Hollywood.\\" Mitt Romney agrees with Gingrich -- on Internet censorship at least. So does Ron Paul. Rick Santorum said the proposals in Congress do \\"go too far,\\" but Internet piracy is a problem that needs to be addressed. Romney says he has the same immigration views he did when he ran for president in 2008 and agrees with Santorum as well. Ron Paul, who is from Texas, says \\"we're all against illegal immigration\\" but also says the U.S. should have \\"a more generous immigration policy.\\" 9:08 p.m. A colleague provides this update: Newt Gingrich paid 994,708 in taxes on 3,162,424 in adjusted income. That's about 31.6%. -- Mitt Romney said earlier this week that he pays about 15% because he has so much investment income. 9:06 p.m. The candidates are asked about losing business to China. Rick Santorum suggests cutting the corporate tax and repealing Obama regulations. 9:03 p.m. Mitt Romney is reminded that his father George Romney released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. Will he follow his family's example? \\"Maybe,\\" Romney says. \\"I don't know how many years I will release.\\" It's a comment that draws hoots from some audience members. Romney repeats: \\"I'm not going to apologize for being successful.\\" 9 p.m. An audience member asks the candidates: When are you going to release your taxes? Mitt Romney says he will release his tax return when he completes it in April -- and \\"if\\" he is the nominee. Romney says the criticism of his refusal to release tax returns is an \\"attack\\" on his business success. Gingrich notes he has released his tax returns in the past hour -- and that if Romney has a problem with his taxes, Republicans need to know before he clinches the nominee. 8:56 p.m. Mitt Romney jumps into the Rick Santorum-Newt Gingrich kerfuffle, and says it illustrates that both are Washington veterans. He says it proves the need for an outsider in the White House, \\"someone who's lived in the real streets of America.\\" Romney also tells Gingrich he is exaggerating his accomplishments and that \\"you're mentioned once in Ronald Reagan's diary.\\" Gingrich tells Romney he prospered under policies he pursued. Romney tells Gingrich -- speaker of the House for four years -- he was in business for 25 years. \\"You're not going to get credit for 25 years,\\" he says. 8:49 p.m. After a break, Rick Santorum is asked about Newt Gingrich's suggestion that Santorum exit the race so that conservatives can unite against Mitt Romney. Not much, Santorum says: \\"Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt.\\" Noting that he beat Gingrich in Iowa and New Hampshire, Santorum says: \\"These are not cogent thoughts.\\" Gingrich says he'll be the president who can bring the most change, citing his experience in the Reagan years and the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress. \\"You're right,\\" he tells Santorum. \\"I think grandiose things.\\" Santorum tells Gingrich he served with him, and Gingrich lacked discipline -- and, reaching way back into history, also criticized Gingrich for ignoring the check bouncing scandal in the House. Gingrich continues to trumpet his experience as \\"a rebel.\\" 8:31 p.m. An audience member triggers a long discussion with a brief question: Can \\"Obamacare\\" really be repealed? Really? Mitt Romney says he can use executive orders to turn some health care responsibilities to the states, but that is only the first step of repeal; he would seek full repeal by proposing a better system. Newt Gingrich says it can be repealed with a Republican president and GOP Congress, and says the health care system is \\"a total mess.\\" He bashes the provision that allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance, but he says that is needed because they can't find jobs in the Obama economy. Rick Santorum -- who is running fourth in some South Carolina polls -- questions whether Romney can really repeal Obamacare because he instituted a similar heath care plan as governor of Massachusetts; he also bashes Gingrich for once backing a mandate that all Americans buy health insurance. Santorum says both foes played \\"footsies with the left\\" on this issue.\\" Romney says Santorum distorted details of his plan, and they go back-and-forth on various aspects of the Massachusetts health care plan. Gingrich, also criticized by Santorum, says he finds it \\"mildly amazing\\" that his opponent doesn't think he can debate Obama on health care. Gingrich says he helped defeat \\"Hillarycare\\" during the Clinton years. He and Santorum go at it over the individual mandate that Gingrich once backed. Ron Paul, upset after being left out of the discussion, notes that he is a physician. He also notes it will be hard to outright repeal Obamacare, but Congress can reduce its influence. Again says the key is less government. 8:24 p.m. The candidates are asked about veterans unemployment. Ron Paul says the government should help everybody, but notes that veterans need special medical help. Rick Santorum says he backs preferences for veterans because they have sacrificed for the country, and blasts President Obama for military cuts. Mitt Romney says states can also help veterans, and warns against expanding the federal government -- though he too blasts Obama for proposed military cuts, and starts talking defense policy. Newt Gingrich talks about the success of the GI Bill after World War II, and says the U.S. needs another \\"transition\\" system for veterans and improved economy for all Americans. 8:22 p.m. Rick Santorum weighs in on jobs, saying too many government programs are actually hurting working people. He stresses the need to rebuild the manufacturing sector of the economy and draws applause by citing South Carolina's potential. 8:17 p.m. Newt Gingrich is invited to specify his problems with Mitt Romney's work at Bain Capital. He says it strip-mined companies for their wealth and left them bankrupt, including two companies in South Carolina. Romney ignores the Bain criticism and says he wants to talk jobs; he accuses President Obama of crony capitalism. Pressed by John King about Bain, Romney says his company built businesses, created some 100,000 jobs and practiced capitalism. \\"My view is that capitalism works,\\" he says. He adds, \\"There's nothing wrong with making profits.\\" He gets applause for both statements. 8:14 p.m. The candidates are asked how to get people back to work. Ron Paul says government needs to \\"get out of the way,\\" including lower taxes. Newt Gingrich calls for repealing new federal business regulations and more domestic energy development. 8:12 p.m. John King asks the other candidates if Newt Gingrich's ex-wife's allegations are an issue. Rick Santorum says character is an issue; Mitt Romney says, \\"Let's get on with the real issues.\\" Ron Paul complains about the media -- but also notes he's been married 54 years. 8:08 p.m. Moderator John King gets right down to it, asking Newt Gingrich about his ex-wife's claims he once wanted an \\"open marriage.\\" Gingrich says no, and tells King that he is \\"appalled\\" he would the open the debate with such a question. He also says the topic is \\"trash\\" and \\"is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine.\\" King notes that ABC aired the report, and Gingrich yells back at him for repeating. Gingrich also says the story is \\"false\\" and reflects anti-Republican media bias -- all responses that get huge applause from the South Carolina crowd. 8:06 p.m. The candidates introduce themselves. Rick Santorum cities his \\"delayed\\" win in Iowa; Mitt Romney cites his marriage of 42 years (hello, Newt?); Newt Gingrich stresses his Georgia roots; Ron Paul emphasizes his experience, and the fact he is the only veteran in the race. 8:00 p.m. CNN is broadcasting tonight's debate and you know what that means: A long, over-produced opening segment, this one focusing on \\"the fight for the South.\\" There's also a playing of the national anthem. 7:50 p.m. The stage is set, after some last-minute changes; thanks to Rick Perry's departure today, there are only four lecterns: Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. ||||| Here’s Washington Wire’s live blog of Thursday night’s GOP debate in Charleston, S.C., the last before Saturday night’s primary. It came on a day when Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropped out of the presidential race, leaving only four candidates on the stage: Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. The debate got off to a tense start when Mr. Gingrich was asked by CNN moderator John King to respond to allegations by an ex-wife that he had asked for an “open marriage.” Mr. Gingrich chastised Mr. King for asking the question, calling the assertions and the media coverage “as close to despicable as anything I can imagine.” “The destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decide people to run for public office,” Mr. Gingrich said to rousing applause from the audience. “I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that.” Keep reading: ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Romney came out in much tougher fashion than he has in past debates, a few hours after he got into it with an Occupy protester at a campaign event. First, he delved into a previous question, about how to fix the economy, and called President Barack Obama \\"the biggest impediment to job growth in this country.\\" King then pressed him to \\"do the math\\" about how he arrived at the 120,000 jobs figure he says he created at Bain. He said he finds it \\"kind of strange on a stage like this with\\" GOPers to be debating this issue. He said the 120,000 came from four businesses in particular that Bain created, and that that figure is to date. \\"I'm very proud of the fact that i've worked throughout my career to create enterprises,\\" he said, adding of his support for capitalism and his feeling that Obama isn't for it: \\"We're gonna stuff it down his throat!\\" Read more about: South Carolina, Debates, 2012 Elections ||||| Story highlights Gingrich replies angrily to first question on ex-wife's allegations Santorum says Romney, Gingrich played \\"footsies with the left\\" Debate comes at end of one of the wildest days in a volatile campaign Romney has been front-runner but polls say his lead is fading The four remaining GOP candidates played to their individual strengths on Thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final, boisterous debate two days before South Carolina's pivotal primary. In a campaign cycle where debates have had direct consequences on the ebb and flow of the race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich turned his contempt for the media into one of his strongest performances yet. When CNN Chief National Correspondent John King opened the debate with a question about open marriage, following an interview by Gingrich's ex-wife saying that he had sought one, the Republican chastised him. \\"To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine,\\" Gingrich told King, the moderator of the debate. Gingrich's response elicited loud applause from the audience. The debate came at the end of a ground-shaking day that saw former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum being declared winner of the Iowa caucuses more than two weeks after his apparent second-place finish to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropping out of the race and throwing his support to Gingrich. Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the fourth candidate in the debate. An angry Gingrich chastised CNN for starting off with the question about his marriage. JUST WATCHED Santorum, Romney battle health care Replay More Videos ...

Marianne Gingrich told The Washington Post that a day after her husband told her about his affair with Callista Bisek in May 1999, the former House speaker delivered a speech titled \\"The Demise of American Culture\\" to a group of Republican women in Pennsylvania. \\"How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people?\\" Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post. Gingrich said the story was false. The three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize Gingrich over the allegations by his ex-wife. Romney took the steady, cautious route that he has throughout the campaign, responding to his rivals only when attacked. Santorum presented himself as a more conservative option to Romney than Gingrich and as the candidate who could draw an effective contrast in the fall with President Barack Obama. As the debate was going on, Gingrich's campaign released his tax returns as he had promised to do earlier. Romney was asked if he would follow his father's lead in releasing 12 years of tax returns. Romney's father, George, ran for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. \\"Maybe,\\" Romney said, before highlighting his business experience and his personal success. \\"I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned.\\" As he had earlier this week, Santorum said he filed his own returns and they were at home on his computer and he would release them once he returned home. Paul said he had no intention to release his returns, arguing that congressional financial statements are revealing enough. The issue of electability was hotly debated. Earlier this week, Gingrich called for both Perry and Santorum to drop out of the race and support his candidacy because they didn't have the experience for a large undertaking like a presidential campaign. With Perry gone, Santorum was left to respond. JUST WATCHED Romney explains Bain jobs 'math' Replay More Videos ...

While Gingrich and Santorum debated their records in Washington and specifically who was more responsible for the Republican Revolution of the 1990s, Romney raised his hand to argue it's time for a Washington outsider. \\"We need to send to Washington someone who has not lived in Washington, but someone who's lived in the real streets of America,\\" Romney said. Every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-Internet piracy bill roiling Congress, and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive. However, both Romney and Santorum said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online. Displaying the off-the-cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of GOP debates, Gingrich joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation. \\"You're asking a conservative about the economic interest of Hollywood,\\" Gingrich said to laughter in the audience. \\"And I'm weighing it, I'm weighing it. I'm not rushing in.\\" Meanwhile Paul touted his libertarian-leaning views, adding he had been an early detractor of the bill. He said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties. The former obstetrician and gynecologist forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion, two issues he knows a lot about. \\"I thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something,\\" Paul told King after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of President Obama's health care reform was truly possible. After a lengthy debate among the other three candidates over the legitimacy of criticizing Romney's political conversion from pro-abortion rights to anti-abortion rights, the crowd booed and chanted Paul's name when King moved on without letting Paul weigh in. \\"John, once again, it's a medical subject and I'm a doctor,\\" Paul said. Four polls over the last two days show Romney's long-held lead in South Carolina nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage, while Gingrich has surged into a virtual tie. Gingrich on Thursday grabbed a major endorsement when Perry announced he was backing Gingrich as he suspended his campaign. Santorum's campaign got a boost on Thursday when the Iowa GOP released the final certified results from its January 3 caucuses, which reversed Romney's eight-vote victory and instead determined that Santorum had won by 34 votes. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In the final Republican debate before the South Carolina primary, the four remaining candidates discussed various issues including allegations from Newt Gingrich's ex-wife, releasing their tax returns, and their strategies for job creation and immigration.

Q: Middle school was rough for me because I was an overweight kid growing up in the 90s. I now teach middle school and have a firsthand look at how cruel today’s kids can be. My mom was skinny and didn’t understand the struggle, and never really taught me anything about being healthy. Instead, she would let my skinny little brother eat anything he wanted, and withheld food from me. I finally figured it out after high school and joined the gym, but to this day (I’m 32) I still battle with overeating and probably always will. I love to exercise, but since I struggle with my food intake, I am still an overweight person, but a physically strong one, and I do have an unhealthy addiction to weighing myself on the scale. Recently, I started involving my daughter in my home workouts, and I’ve been showing her how to make healthy choices. We go for light jogs together, or she will ride her bike with me while I jog at my pace, and we do step workouts to music and we play just dance on the switch. We do one of these activities every weeknight, and have been for about a month now. Today she asked me if she could get on the scale to see how much she weighs. I explained to her that it’s not about a number on the scale, but how you feel when your body can do things that you didn’t think it could do (even though I admittedly don’t take my own advice when it comes to this). She still wanted to weigh in. I let her. I’m worried that she will develop an unhealthy scale addiction like I have. I don’t want her to go through what I did, and I want her to be healthy.

Part #3: Classify each post into the following categories: AUTHOR, OTHER, EVERYBODY, and NOBODY. Usage: In this case, the response would be OTHER because the author's mom didn't teach them about being healthy and withheld food from them. The author is trying to teach their daughter a better approach to health by involving her in home workouts and making healthy choices, so the fault lies more with the author's mother for not providing a healthier environment for the author growing up.

Article: The United States has now recorded its first death from a vampire bat bite, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On July 29, 2010, a young Mexican migrant showed up to work at a Louisiana sugar cane plantation. He worked one day and then complained of fatigue, shoulder pain and numbness. By August 3 he’d been sent to a New Orleans hospital. When he developed a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, doctors thought he might have encephalitis, or maybe meningitis. He didn’t. Doctors tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes, arboviruses, Lyme disease, autoimmune neuropathies and all came back negative. Meanwhile, the 19-year-old was deteriorating. When he had trouble breathing, doctors placed a tube down his throat to help. Vampire bats are out for blood: Here's how they find it Despite “True Blood’s” Louisiana setting, nobody thought of vampire bats because there are no vampire bats in the United States outside of zoos. But the young man had only just arrived in the United States. As an investigation later discovered, he had been bitten on the heel of his foot on July 15 while sleeping back home in Michoacán, a state in Mexico’s southwest. The bat had transmitted rabies, a common complication from vampire bat bites in central and South America. Doctors did begin to suspect rabies — and the state’s public health office was duly notified, but it wasn’t until August 20 that rabies tests came back positive. He died on August 21. Every person who had been in contact with him had to be found and notified. Some who had shared drinking vessels with him, for example, could have caught the disease. But according to CDC, so far there is no evidence anybody did. ||||| U.S. health authorities have announced the first death by a vampire bat in the United States. According to the AFP, on July 15, 2010, a 19-year-old man was bitten by a vampire bat in Michoacan, Mexico. Ten days later, the migrant farm worker left for the U.S. to pick sugar cane at a Louisiana plantation. He fell sick, presenting symptoms of fatigue, shoulder pain, numbness in his left hand and a drooping left eye. MSNBC.com writes, \\"Despite 'True Blood’s' Louisiana setting, nobody thought of vampire bats because there are no vampire bats in the United States outside of zoos. But the young man had only just arrived in the United States.\\" Tests later confirmed that he was infected with rabies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently wrote, \\"This case represents the first reported human death from a vampire bat rabies virus variant in the United States.\\" According to the CDC, the victim had a notably aggressive form of rabies. There have been 32 human rabies cases reported to the CDC since 2000. According to the CDC, \\"Although vampire bats currently are found only in Latin America, research suggests that the range of these bats might be expanding as a result of changes in climate. Expansion of vampire bats into the United States likely would lead to increased bat exposures to both humans and animals (including domestic livestock and wildlife species) and substantially alter rabies virus dynamics and ecology in the southern United States.\\" Reports suggest that other animals are and will continue to be affected by climate change -- how that will impact humans remains to be seen. NPR recently asked if climate change could be \\"making the nation's bears hungry.\\" Vampire bats made news earlier this week when researchers reported that these bats are able to find blood through a heat-detecting molecule covering nerve endings on their noses. According to ScienceDaily, once an adult vampire bat has found a vein to feed on, it can drink half of its body weight in blood. Although they may be feared, killing bats is not the answer, and the CDC writes, \\"the elimination of vampire bats to prevent human or animal rabies remains controversial.\\" A deadly disease, white-nose syndrome, has killed over one million bats of different species in the past five years.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

A can opener is not designed for this purpose and would not be suitable. Therefore, in this situation, the best option is option (2). Step 2: Select the cheese Select a block of cheese that you want to shred. Consider the type of cheese, its firmness, and its purpose (for example, which dish the shredded cheese will be used in). Step 3: Prepare the cheese If the cheese is cold or hard, let it sit at room temperature for a short while to soften slightly. This will make it easier to grate. Ensure that the cheese block is clean and dry. Step 4: Hold the cheese grater Hold the cheese grater securely in one hand. Make sure to place it on a stable surface, such as a cutting board or countertop. Step 5: Grate the cheese With your other hand, grasping the block of cheese, gently press the cheese against the grater's holes, and make firm, downward motions across the grater's surface. Be sure to apply even pressure while grating. Step 6: Collect the shredded cheese As you grate the cheese, the shreds will collect either on the cutting board or in a container, if your grater has one. Periodically check the collection area and move the shredded cheese to a separate container as it accumulates. Step 7: Clean up Once you have shredded the desired amount of cheese, carefully clean the grater, making sure to remove any cheese remnants from the grater's holes.

However, it is evident that they have a certain level of familiarity with technology and are open-minded and eager to learn more and develop their skills. They seem to be in the stage of experimentation and growth, which is essential for becoming more proficient in the use of technology. As the person continues to explore, learn, and engage with different forms of technology, their level of tech-savviness is likely to increase. It is crucial for individuals in today's digital age to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, as technology continues to change and impact various aspects of our lives. To become more tech-savvy, the person can engage in various activities, such as: 1. Reading and researching about technology and its current trends. 2. Engaging in online communities, forums, and discussions related to technology. 3. Participating in classes or workshops focused on technology topics. 4. Actively experimenting with new devices, applications, and tools to gain hands-on experience. 5. Seeking help and support from more knowledgeable friends or acquaintances. By engaging in these activities and maintaining an open-minded attitude towards learning, the person can gradually develop a higher level of tech-savviness and, in turn, feel more comfortable and confident in navigating the digital world."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. In 1983 he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM. In mid-1985, Beck was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for the morning-drive radio broadcast by WRKA in Louisville, Kentucky. His four-hour weekday show was called Captain Beck and the A-Team. Beck had a reputation as a \\"young up-and-comer\\". The show was not political and included the usual off-color antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations. The show slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management. Months later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local \\"morning zoo\\" program. During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station's morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on-the-air, mocking her recent miscarriage. In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. Beck was subsequently fired in 1990 due to poor ratings. Beck then moved on to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city's leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean. According to a former associate, Beck was \\"completely out of it\\" when a station manager went to bail him out. When Gray, then Beck were fired, the two men spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, Beck and Gray both moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gagineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups. When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999. The Glenn Beck Program first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took their afternoon time slot from eighteenth to first place within a year. In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, The New York Times reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck's contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked 4th in the nation with over six and a half million listeners. As of July 2013, Beck was tied for number four in the ratings behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.

Question: suppose a heatwave taking place happens, how will it affect More oxygen is taken in through the nose or mouth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"During a heatwave, the body's demand for oxygen may increase in order to help regulate the body's temperature and maintain optimal functioning. As a result, it can be said that more oxygen is taken in through the nose or mouth. In the given process, the oxygen taken in through the nose or mouth travels into the body and breaks down glucose, producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. The carbon dioxide is then exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. If the heatwave influences the body's demand for more oxygen, it will potentially affect the second effect mentioned, which is breaking down glucose. In a heatwave, the body works harder to maintain its core temperature, leading to an increase in metabolic rate. As a result, the body's demand for glucose as a source of energy may also increase. With more oxygen being inhaled to meet the heightened energy demand, there will be an increase in glucose breakdown. This, in turn, will lead to a higher production of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. The supposed perturbation of a heatwave leads to more oxygen being taken in through the nose or mouth, which consequently influences the second effect mentioned in the process by increasing the breakdown of glucose within the body. Therefore, the heatwave exerts a \\"more\\" effect on the second effect mentioned in the process. Please note that there is individual variability in how the body responds to heatwaves, and this general answer might not accurately represent every individual's response to heat stress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Some securities get ingrained in us from an early age. Some children are harshly criticized or ignored and have a tendency to develop low self esteem. Other people develop insecurity when they fail for the first time at something, or are in a new environment. Know how your insecurities develop, and what makes them worse, to handle them better. There are ways to change your perspective on yourself so that you can begin to feel good about yourself. However, it is a long process. The brain can grow and change long after our bodies reach their permanent size, a phenomenon called brain plasticity. This allows you to learn or to change your thinking patterns at any age. By changing your thoughts, you can ultimately change your behavior. You can do CBT by yourself or with a therapist. Keep in mind that, if you find any of the steps difficult, you should see a therapist who is knowledgeable about CBT to help you. The first step in CBT is to identify your thought patterns. Many people who have negative thoughts about themselves believe they are not worth very much, and they will also believe that there is little they can do to change the situation. You need to begin to change the way you think about yourself by first acknowledging how you feel. Being self aware can be difficult at first. Well meaning friends wishing to help you may just tell you to “get over it” and recognize your strengths. There’s more to it than merely making the decision to change. You should start a journal of all the thoughts you have a day, both positive and negative. Write down the situations that surrounded the event, what your feelings were, and how you handled the situation. This will help you examine your thought patterns over time so you can start changing the negative thinking. Be honest with yourself in the journal. You need to know all your different thoughts to get a full picture. The more honest you are, the more you can change your behavior. Be consistent. Write about everything that you think is important; or, everything that happened at work; or, everything that you worry will happen to your spouse when you’re gone travelling. Once you journal for a while, you should look back over what you've written. This way, you can achieve more objectivity in relation to your thoughts so you can accept them and come to terms with yourself. Try to remember how you felt when you wrote them, and instead of feeling ashamed or bad about your negative thoughts, accept them. Everyone has them and if you first accept them, you can start to change them. By allowing yourself to feel your negative thoughts, you can own them and begin to make changes. Once you recognize the thought pattern that is causing you to have low self esteem, you can begin to change the way you think. Once you journal all of your thoughts and feelings for a few weeks and accept your feelings as being valid, you need to examine your thoughts and start changing the way you think. Look over your journal, looking for common thought patterns. Find a common thread through some of your thoughts or choose a particularly harsh thought. Take that negative thought and try turn it around to something positive. For example, you were feeling bad because you got behind on an assignment at work. Instead of focusing on your short comings, think about all the times you achieved something great at work or pulled off a hard project. Think to yourself, \\"I can turn this around because I have a history of doing great work. I just need to focus and I will do amazing, just like on my other work.\\" You want to take things that you feel and make them into positive situations. Know it is okay to feel them, but acknowledge that there are more productive ways of seeing yourself that will help you feel better about yourself. Forgive yourself for past mistakes or events. There is no way to change the past, and you have to give yourself the opportunity to improve. Do you know the saying, “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have”? Treat yourself according to who you want to be, not who you were. It will be easier to become that person. Once you look over your activities, you may see that you miss out on certain situations because of your low self esteem. If you notice a pattern of behavior, such as refusing to go into certain social situations because of anxiety and negativity, you should start trying to move past these behaviors. Once you change the thought processes around these events, you can push yourself to enter into them without the worry that there will be negative consequences. For example, you often say no to going out with coworkers because you think they will find you boring and you will just make a fool of yourself. Instead of thinking this way, think about the positive things about yourself and what might come out of it. You have other friends who like you and enjoy your company, so you are interesting. You may also make some new friends and become closer to those at work. If you think of the possibilities of a situation instead of the horrible things that might happen, you might be able to think about yourself in a positive light as well. This type of thinking can take time to change. Learning new ways to think about yourself takes practice, but don’t be afraid to think positively about yourself. It may seem difficult at first, but if you keep acknowledging your feelings and recognizing your negative behavior, you can make small moves to change it. After a while, you will find yourself doing it more and more to the point where you have more positive thoughts in your day than negative. If you find yourself having a hard time with this process, you may need to see a therapist. CBT is aided by having a trained professional who knows the methods and might be able to see things about yourself that you may not. In CBT sessions, the therapist works in partnership with you as you work towards your goals. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the development of insecurities and low self-esteem and suggests using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to overcome them.

California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The average person could obtain such a vehicle when: Step 1: Analyze the context The context discusses Arnold Schwarzenegger's Hummer vehicles, particularly the hydrogen-powered Hummer (H2H), and the development of the California Hydrogen Highway Network to support hydrogen refueling. Step 2: Consider the factors influencing availability Factors influencing the availability of such vehicles to the average person include cost, infrastructure, and demand for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Step 3: Assess the current state of the market Currently, hydrogen-powered vehicles are relatively expensive and less common than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles or electric vehicles. The infrastructure for hydrogen refueling is also not as widespread as gas stations or electric charging stations. Step 4: Estimate potential future availability As more manufacturers introduce hydrogen-powered vehicles and as infrastructure improves, costs may come down and access to hydrogen refueling stations could become more prevalent. This would make it more feasible for the average person to obtain a hydrogen-powered vehicle. Step 5: Provide an estimated timeline Although it is challenging to precisely predict when such vehicles will become widely accessible to the average person, significant advancements in hydrogen technology and infrastructure over the next decade could help make hydrogen-powered vehicles a more viable option for consumers.

However, it does not specify the year when the islands became dependent on Saint Helena. To answer the question, it is necessary to delve into the history of the islands concerned. Assuming the question is about the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, which are currently administered as dependencies of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, here's some information: Saint Helena itself was discovered by the Portuguese in 1502 and was strategically significant as a stopping point for ships during the era of the East India Company. Ascension Island was claimed by the British in 1815 to curtail any possible French attempt to free Napoleon Bonaparte, who was exiled to Saint Helena. The British garrison on Ascension was reduced in 1922, and administration of the island was transferred to the government of Saint Helena. Tristan da Cunha is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean, consisting of the main island of Tristan da Cunha and the uninhabited islands of Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough. The islands were first discovered in 1506 by a Portuguese sailor, Tristão da Cunha, after whom they were named. However, the archipelago remained uninhabited until the 19th century. In 1816, the British declared Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands as dependencies of Saint Helena to act as a strategic outpost and prevent any possible French attack on Saint Helena. Thus, while the sentence in question does not answer when the islands were declared dependent on Saint Helena, historical context reveals that Ascension Island was declared a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, while Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands became dependencies in 1816."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The surface of Mars has volcanoes and canyons. There is a polar ice cap and channels that were once filled with water. Curiosity has found evidence of a flowing stream. Q: What two structures are found on mars? Choices: - geysers and canyons - Mountains and Creeks - Trees and Canyons - volcanoes and canyons A: Answer:","completion":"Volcanoes and Canyons Based on the given paragraph, it is evident that the surface of Mars features volcanoes and canyons. These geological structures provide valuable insights into the Martian landscape and its geological history. Volcanoes on Mars are a result of volcanic activity, just as on Earth. They are formed when magma from deep within the planet's interior rises to the surface, eventually erupting and creating a volcanic structure. The most prominent volcano on Mars is Olympus Mons, which is not only the tallest volcano on the Red Planet but also the largest and tallest known volcano in our entire solar system. Canyons on Mars are massive geological structures formed through processes like erosion, tectonic activity, and ancient water flows. One of the most famous Martian canyons is Valles Marineris, which stretches over 4,000 kilometers long and is up to 7 kilometers deep. This immense canyon system is much larger than Earth's Grand Canyon and is considered one of the most significant features on the Martian surface. Furthermore, the paragraph mentions a polar ice cap and channels that were once filled with water. The presence of a polar ice cap suggests that Mars has a cold climate and that some of its water is stored in the form of ice. The discovery of channels indicates that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars, shaping the planet's geology and providing a possible habitat for past life. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"volcanoes and canyons,\\" as these two structures are specifically mentioned in the given paragraph and represent important components of Mars' geology and landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare.

Article: The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger. The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons.

Don’t schedule any meetings or errands on your birthday unless they are absolutely necessary. You want to worry about nothing at all for your birthday. Going to bed early ensures you wake up bright and early to take advantage of your clean slate. The average number of hours to aim for when getting sleep is between 7 and 9 hours for the average adult, but adding an hour in either direction may also be appropriate depending on your needs. Don’t drink too much before going to bed. If you drink too much in the evening, you’ll find your sleep interrupted by the need to go to the bathroom all night. Consider tossing the alarm clock for the evening. Just let your body handle everything, and get up only when you feel refreshed. Don’t be afraid to sleep in. It's your day after all. A few extra hours of sleep feel great and might be what you need to get in the right mindset for the day. Go out to a fancy restaurant and get your favorite meal, or order in and let the food come to your front door. Your birthday is a good day to order that new meal or dish you’ve always wanted to try.

If you live with someone, ask if they’ll bring breakfast right to your bed. Bring a food tray and napkins so that you don’t get crumbs or runny egg on your bed. Use a scented gel and some favorite soap, even if it's usually saved for going-out occasions. Light candles, dim the lights and play some music to optimize your relaxation. Bath bombs and other bath accessories are perfect to moisturize and feel great, whether you are starting or ending the day with your bath. You’ve probably received a few cards or packages in the mail for your birthday by the time the big day rolls around. Don’t open them as soon as you get them. Save them for your birthday to accentuate the moment. People are thinking about you! Spend the day deciding how to best display those cards. Cards make a great decoration for window sills or on the kitchen table. If you received gift cards or money for your birthday, think about what you are going to do with those gifts. The day is open, but make sure you don’t let the money burn a hole in your pocket. Buy yourself a cake, or make one yourself. If you make one yourself, consider making it the night before. After all, you don't want to work too hard on your birthday. If you make your own cake, go for the guilty pleasure and eat the leftover frosting with a spoon. You deserve it!

Verity Ann Lambert (27 November 1935 - 22 November 2007) was an English television and film producer. She was the founding producer of the science-fiction series Doctor Who and she had a long association with Thames Television. Her many credits include Adam Adamant Lives! Later in 1974 Lambert became Head of Drama at Thames Television. During her time in this position she oversaw several high-profile and successful contributions to the ITV network, including The Naked Civil Servant (1975), Rock Follies (1976-77), Rumpole of the Bailey (1978-92) and Edward and Mrs Simpson (1978). In 1976 she was also made responsible for overseeing the work of Euston Films, Thames' subsidiary film production company, at the time best known as the producers of The Sweeney. In 1979 she transferred to Euston full-time as the company's Chief Executive, overseeing productions such as Quatermass (1979), Minder (1979-94) and Widows (1983). At Thames and Euston, Lambert enjoyed the most sustained period of critical and popular success of her career. The Naked Civil Servant won a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for its star John Hurt as well as a Broadcasting Press Guild Award and a prize at the Prix Italia; Rock Follies won a BAFTA and a Royal Television Society Award, while Widows also gained BAFTA nominations and ratings of over 12 million--unusually for a drama serial, it picked up viewers over the course of its six-week run. Minder went on to become the longest-running series produced by Euston Films, surviving for over a decade following Lambert's departure from the company. Television historian Lez Cooke described Lambert's time in control of the drama department at Thames as \\"an adventurous period for the company, demonstrating that it was not only the BBC that was capable of producing progressive television drama during the 1970s. Lambert wanted Thames to produce drama series 'which were attempting in one way or another to tackle modern problems and life,' an ambition which echoed the philosophy of her mentor Sydney Newman.\\" Howard Schuman, the writer of Rock Follies, also later praised the bravery of Lambert's commissioning. \\"Verity Lambert had just arrived as head of drama at Thames TV and she went for broke,\\" he told The Observer newspaper in 2002. \\"She commissioned a serial, Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill, for safety, but also Bill Brand, one of the edgiest political dramas ever, and us ... Before we had even finished making the first series, Verity commissioned the second.\\" Lambert's association with Thames and Euston Films continued into the 1980s. In 1982, she rejoined the staff of parent company Thames Television as director of drama, and was given a seat on the company's board. In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as chief executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as director of production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her job here was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. \\"Unfortunately, the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of--Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese--it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience.\\" Lambert was Chair of the British Film Institute Production Board from 1981-82.

Some people don't have a problem with this, but I am one of the ones who do. So, if you have several inches of hair on the top of your head to provide a cushion for these things, or an extremely hard head, go ahead and buy this one. If you're like me, tho, look elsewhere.

Cassini Probe Illuminates Saturn #39;s Moon The photos sent back from the international Cassini spacecraft were taken during a flyby that took it within 745 miles of Titan. Scientists at NASA #39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory declared themselves Which topic is this article about?","completion":"This article is about the international Cassini spacecraft capturing and sending back photos of Saturn's moon, Titan, during a close flyby. The spacecraft flew within 745 miles of the moon, allowing it to obtain detailed images. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory were involved in analyzing the data and findings that Cassini transmitted during this flyby. Cassini was a joint effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) launched in 1997. The mission's primary objective was to study Saturn, its rings, and its moons, including its largest moon, Titan. The spacecraft provided valuable information regarding the composition and atmosphere of Titan, as well as insights into the geological processes of this fascinating moon. Throughout its mission, Cassini made several flybys of Titan, each yielding crucial data that helped scientists understand the complex nature of this moon. In addition to imaging, Cassini's suite of scientific instruments enabled it to analyze the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere, which scientists believe to be similar to what Earth's atmosphere was like billions of years ago. The Cassini-Huygens mission discovered lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane, on Titan's surface, and some even theorize that it might harbor the conditions necessary for primitive life to exist. The Huygens probe, which was a part of the Cassini mission, successfully landed on Titan in 2005, becoming the first landing on a moon in the outer solar system. The probe transmitted images and data about Titan's surface and atmosphere for a few hours before it ceased operation. The flyby that the article mentions likely contributed new insights into Titan's atmospheric dynamics, weather patterns, and surface features, as well as provided high-resolution images that continue to deepen our understanding of this enigmatic moon. The cooperation between various space agencies working together on the Cassini mission highlights the power of international collaboration in advancing human knowledge of the universe. In September 2017, the Cassini mission concluded with the spacecraft deliberately being plunged into Saturn's atmosphere. This was done to ensure that it would not accidentally contaminate any of Saturn's potentially habitable moons. The Cassini mission has left a lasting legacy in the field of planetary science, and its wealth of data continues to improve our understanding of Saturn and its numerous moons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: canoe on shore with rainbow across the lake","completion":"In the given sentence \\"canoe on shore with rainbow across the lake,\\" the most salient words are as follows: 1. Canoe: A canoe is a lightweight, narrow watercraft typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by the passengers using a single-bladed paddle. In this sentence, the canoe serves as the primary subject and represents the mode of transportation or recreational activity people can engage in on the lake. 2. Shore: The shore refers to the land that borders a body of water, such as a lake, sea, or ocean. It is an essential element in the sentence as it establishes the location of the canoe and serves as a reference point concerning the lake and the rainbow. 3. Rainbow: A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that appears as a multicolored arc in the sky when sunlight is refracted, reflected, and dispersed through water droplets in the atmosphere. The mention of a rainbow in the sentence adds an aesthetic aspect and visual detail to the scene, creating a picturesque and peaceful effect. It also highlights an appealing natural event taking place near the lake. 4. Lake: The lake is the body of water at the center of the scene described in the statement. It provides the context and environment for the other elements (canoe, shore, and rainbow) in the sentence. A lake can represent recreation, serene surroundings, and relaxation, connecting the other salient words to establish a cohesive scenario. These four words—canoe, shore, rainbow and lake—are the most salient as they work together to create a vivid image, set the scene, and convey key elements of the landscape and activity alluded to in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Do not pull the kitten out of the cat carrier right away; leave it in there with the door open and allow it to exit the carrier at its own pace. Make sure it sees its food and water bowl. This may motivate the kitten to leave its carrier and explore. When the kitten does come out, gently pick it up and place it in the litter box to give it an opportunity to go to the bathroom. If the kitten doesn’t go, at least it will know there is a litter box for it use. If you have other pets in the house, keep the kitten in its own room (along with litter box, bed, food and water) for a week before introducing him to the other pets. If you have small children, instruct them to be very gentle when they pick up, hold, or play with the kitten to avoid injury to either the kitten or kid. Just let it take its time and it will get used to you and the house soon. Keep the kitten in one room (unless you are there to watch carefully) and other pets away from the kitten for a week before introducing the cat to the other pets. After a while, try playing with the kitten but don't force it to do anything it doesn't want to do. It should come out soon enough, and don't panic if it comes out of the pet carrier and hides under something. Let the kitten explore the room. It will have a lot of sniffing to do. Kittens are pretty smart and will take to using the litter box in no time. That is, as long as they can get into it, it’s cleaned daily (scooped), and it’s in a quiet spot.","completion":"Imagine you have a new little kitty in a box, called a cat carrier. You shouldn't pull the kitten out from there right away. Just open the door and let the kitten come out when it's ready. Make sure the kitty can see its food and water, because that might make it want to come out and explore. When the kitty finally comes out, gently pick it up and put it in the litter box - this is a special place where it can go to the bathroom. If it doesn't go, that's okay. At least now it knows where its bathroom is! If you have other pets or little kids, they need to be extra careful around the new kitty. The new kitty should have its own room for a week before it meets other pets. And the kids should be gentle when they play with the kitty to keep everyone safe. For the first week, the kitten should stay in one room only and let it out only when you can watch it carefully, and keep other pets away during this time. Over time, the new kitty might start to play with you. But remember, never force the kitty to play if it doesn't want. Sometimes the kitty might hide under something; that's okay, they are just exploring and sniffing around their new home.

Question: What era is the memorabilia from on the vessel? Movie title: Death Ship Movie plot: A mysterious black freighter sails through the night, apparently deserted. Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain.... The answer is:","completion":"The memorabilia on the vessel in the movie \\"Death Ship\\" is from the 1930s era. The survivors exploring the mysterious black freighter find cobwebs and various items from the 1930s as they wander through its corridors, signifying that the ship might have a connection to or be influenced by that time period. This adds to the overall eerie atmosphere of the film and further emphasizes the ship's mysterious and possibly sinister past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Using positive qualifiers like this one implies that the critic admires the movie's visual and aesthetic appeal. 2. \\"Part parlor game\\" – Describing the movie in part as a parlor game indicates that the critic sees it as engaging and entertaining, employing clever plot devices or intellectual playfulness. The term \\"parlor game\\" suggests there might be a sense of fun, with characters trying to outwit one another, and the audience being drawn into the enjoyable challenge the game presents. 3. \\"Part psychological case study\\" – Labeling the movie as a psychological case study implies that it dives into the deeper intricacies of the human mind and emotions.

When a toy is destroyed, it typically means that it has been broken or damaged in some way. The most practical approach to rectifying the situation would be to attempt to fix or restore the toy to its original state, which can be accomplished through repairing it. Examining the other options: - Raise: This term usually refers to lifting or elevating something, which doesn't make sense in the context of a destroyed toy. - Make: Creating an entirely new toy might seem like a possible solution, but it would not be the same as Wendy's original favorite toy. Repairing it would preserve its sentimental value. - Reincarnate: This term is associated with a spiritual belief in which a soul is reborn in a new body after death. It is not applicable to inanimate objects like toys and is therefore not a suitable option. - Build: This option is similar to \\"make,\\" but it specifically implies constructing something. While building a new toy is a possibility, it still wouldn't be the same as her original favorite toy. Repairing it would maintain its uniqueness and significance to Wendy. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"repair\\" as the answer because it makes the most sense in the context of restoring a destroyed toy.

The justice and interior ministers both offered to resign a day after Turkey disclosed it had warned Belgium last summer that it suspected Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, one of two suicide bombers at the Brussels Airport, had ties to Islamic State—to no avail. Mr.... ||||| The fact that home-grown suicide bombers known to the authorities were able to hit Brussels precisely at a time when the city was saturated with police and intelligence services hunting terrorists has led to soul-searching in Belgium. There could be no denying mistakes had been made when two ministers offered to resign over failings in the tracking of the Bakraoui brothers, who blew themselves up on Tuesday at the airport and metro. The prime minister, Charles Michel, refused to allow the key ministers to stand down. Nevertheless, there was a damning revelation that one of the suicide bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, who Belgian authorities initially said was known only for criminality, had in fact been flagged by Turkey as a “foreign terrorist fighter” last year and deported to the Netherlands. Experts in the intelligence community warned that outright “Belgium bashing” from abroad was not going to help matters. France, which is itself facing criticism at home over failings in preventing terrorist attacks, had to calm a potential diplomatic spat after its finance minister, Michel Sapin, accused Belgian officials of a “lack of will” and “maybe also a kind of naivety” in failing to handle the spread of radical Islam. Belgian ministers offer to resign after criticism over Brussels attacks Read more The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, jumped to Belgium’s defence, dismissing accusations that it was a “failed state”. The task of unpicking exactly what type of gap in intelligence that the surveillance-savvy and well-organised bombers were able to slip through will take time, but it holds the key to preventing further Islamic State attacks. There is a long list of potential failings to consider. The first is how Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, who had skipped parole after serving less than half of a nine-year sentence for armed robbery, was able to leave for Syria and then be deported from Turkey as a “foreign terrorist fighter” without his domestic authorities noticing he was a militant. At the time of the Brussels attacks, he and his brother were actively being hunted by police following a raid on a terrorist hideout in Brussels connected to November’s Paris attacks. It is not certain whether the Bakraoui brothers were the two men known to have fled from a flat across rooftops, eluding police snipers. Only four days before the Brussels attacks, Europe’s most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect in the Paris attacks that killed 130 people, had been cornered in Brussels. Police knew other dangerous suspects remained on the run, yet the Brussels bombers, who were linked to the Paris attacks, escaped detection. Najim Laachraoui, who is believed to have been the second Brussels airport suicide bomber, had been wanted by police since December over the Paris attacks, though under a false identity that was only unmasked last week. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ibrahim el-Bakraoui after his arrest in Turkey last year. Photograph: AP Laachraoui, who is thought to have been the Paris attacks’ bomb-maker, went to Syria in September 2013 in one of the first waves of jihadis to leave Belgium for the country. In February, a Belgian court convicted him in absentia for his involvement with Isis. “If you put all things in a row, you can ask yourself major questions,” said the Belgian interior minister, Jan Jambon. “When an attack happens, it by definition means there has been a failure,” Thomas Renard, a terrorism expert at the Egmont Institute, a Brussels-based thinktank, told the Guardian. It is unlikely that Belgium underestimated the overall threat from terrorism and jihadis returning from fighting abroad. For several years, it has been on the frontline of terrorist cells in northern Europe and was well aware of the danger. Per capita, Belgium is Isis’s most fertile recruiting ground in Europe. After November’s attacks in Paris, Belgian authorities shut down Brussels for almost a week, closing schools, offices and cultural centres, cancelling sporting events and putting the army on the streets as there were fears an attack was imminent. But questions will be asked about whether Belgian analysis of specific threats was correct and whether it was watching the right people. “It will be a long time before we know exactly what happened,” Renard said. “There is a question about whether they didn’t take the full measure of attacks being prepared in Belgium, or whether the role of certain individuals was missed. “Or perhaps they focused on individuals considered most dangerous and missed the bigger picture of other figures involved. They could have underestimated the size and scope of the cell.” This appeared to have earlier been the case with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the ringleader of the Paris attacks. He was linked to the terrorist cell that was raided in Verviers near the Belgian-German border in January last year, in which the Belgian authorities said they had foiled an imminent attack. Yet Abaaoud’s importance did not seem to register, he escaped the net and later led the Paris attacks. Belgium’s difficulties in reconciling its French and Flemish-speaking communities were illustrated five years ago when it broke the modern-day world record for the longest time failing to form a government. It has so many layers of local and federal authority that information can slip through the gaps. The Brussels-born Abdeslam brothers involved in the Paris attacks were noticed by local police as having been radicalised and as potentially dangerous but when the information was transferred to federal police it appeared to get lost. Belgian intelligence staff have been evaluated positively by foreign intelligence services. “They’re good,” said Bernard Squarcini, a former head of French counter-intelligence, but he felt there were not enough of them. Figures are confidential but it is thought that between 600 and 800 people work in civil intelligence and up to 800 work in military intelligence – with perhaps about 500 devoted to tackling Isis. That could equate to a ratio of three officers per jihadi suspect who is considered dangerous. Permanent telephone or human surveillance needs more people than that. Last month the Belgian government announced a €400m (£315m) programme to combat “terrorism and radicalisation” that included the hiring of 1,000 additional police, prosecutors, state security agents and other personnel. As far back as November, Michel, the prime minister, said: “We have to do more, and we have to do better.” After this week’s attacks, those words seem more pertinent than ever. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In the wake of the attacks in Brussels and the ensuing manhunt, more people with terror links have been arrested whilst Belgium has come under fire for the failings of its counter-terrorism activities.

The new and improved 100-dollar bill, designed to cut down on counterfeiters, was expected to be released back in 2010, but production snafus delayed that date to 2011, and then again to October 2013. Today, David Wolman of The New Yorker reports that 30 million of the new 100 bills were incorrectly produced, and so the Federal Reserve might have to delay the bills' release once again. It's another embarrassing problem for the Federal Reserve, which budgeted for the bills' release, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which was responsible for its production. (Appropriately, the bureau's website is named moneyfactory.gov.) The bills' release in October can still be salvaged if the Fort Worth, Texas branch of production makes up for the problems at the Washington, D.C. mint printer, but that timetable might not be feasible. Update: A spokesperson for the Bureau says that despite \\"concerns during production validation\\" at the D.C. branch, the fulfillment of the complete money order to the Federal Reserve remains on schedule for this fall. Importantly, though, the problem won't cost the government that much to fix, even though the bills represent 3 billion. Because the defective bills were not approved for release to the public, the cost of this faulty episode won't approach that number. Certainly, the production of new bills and disposal of the defective bills will cost taxpayers. Exactly how much will this error cost? With some back-of-the-napkin calculations, we came to a cost of 3.79 million. Let's go through that process. The old 100 bill cost just 7.8 cents to make, according to the Fed, but the newer version's state-of-the-art features — including a 3D security ribbon, color-changing liberty bell, and watermarks galore — will surely increase the cost of production. The Fed's budget plan lists the new 100 at 12.6 cents per bill, which comes near an estimate in a 2010 article in The Washington Post that the new Benjamins would cost about 12 cents to produce. Now let's do some basic math. 12.6 cents, or .126 dollars, multiplied by 30 million defective bills, comes out to wasted production cost of 3.78 million. So production of 30 million replacement 100-dollar bills will only cost about .1% of the value of those bills. In addition, there are the costs of disposal of the defective money. A 2011 article in The Atlantic explains that about 6 billion bills are disposed every year. With 37 regional Fed banks, this comes to about 160 million bills per branch. In a 1997 article in The New York Times, an executive at the Fed branch in Los Angeles said disposal of his undisclosed amount of bills amounted to 60,000 annually. Let's assume that all Fed branches pay the same amount for money disposal (again, these are estimates). Using proportions, we see that if disposal of 160 million bills costs 60 grand, then disposal of 30 million 100-dollar bills will cost 12,000. That 12,000 cost is not that much compared to the previous 3.78 million estimation, and added together, we now come to a cost of about 3.79 million dollars for disposal of defective bills and production of new ones. There are, in addition, costs for employees, overtime, and inspections, but the simple cost of disposing the defective bills and introducing the new ones won't be terribly costly for taxpayers. Pretty strange to consider that all the money in your wallet isn't worth much, no? And therein lies the truly important cost of the error, as Wolman notes: \\"It threatens to injure the aura—the almightiness—of the dollar that enables most people to go about their business without ever stopping to examine the bills in their hand or to contemplate what gives them value. The only thing conferring value on those dollars, of course, is trust in other people’s trust in them, which is both weird and magnificent.\\" Yes, trust in money is all that matters here. Which is why the continued bungling by the Fed and Bureau to produce new 100 bills is concerning, though not for the small monetary costs of the error.

Eric Levenson ||||| For the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been preparing to introduce a redesigned hundred-dollar bill into circulation. It will have a Liberty Bell that changes color, a new hidden message on Ben Franklin’s collar, and tiny 3-D images that move when you tilt the bill this way or that. But delay has followed delay. And now again: The New Yorker has learned that another production snafu has taken place at one of the country’s two currency factories, according to a document from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The cause of the latest blunder is something known as “mashing,” according to Darlene Anderson, a spokeswoman for the bureau. When too much ink is applied to the paper, the lines of the artwork aren’t as crisp as they should be, like when a kid tries to carefully color inside the lines—using watercolors and a fat paintbrush. Anderson said this happens “infrequently.” Still, this foul-up is only the latest embarrassment for the bureau. The redesigned hundred-dollar bill was meant to be released in early 2011, but has been delayed for the past two years because of a massive printing error, separate from the recent mashing problem, in which some notes were left with a blank spot. This time, recent batches of cash from the Washington, D.C., plant contained “clearly unacceptable” bills intermixed with passable ones, according to a July memo to employees from Larry Felix, the bureau’s director. So the Fed is returning more than thirty million hundred-dollar notes and demanding its money back, Felix wrote. Another thirty billion dollars’ worth of paper sits in limbo awaiting examination, and Fed officials have informed the bureau that they will not accept any hundred-dollar notes made at the Washington, D.C., facility until further notice. Felix’s letter says internal quality-control measures should have prevented the bureau “from delivering defective work,” and that those responsible would be held accountable. The bureau now has to race to meet an October 8th deadline for delivering the year’s cash orders and to finally get the new hundred-dollar bill into circulation as promised. To that end, Felix has ordered the country’s other money factory, in Fort Worth, Texas, to accelerate its efforts. “There are dire consequences involved here because BEP sells Federal Reserve notes to the Board to finance our entire operation,” he wrote in the memo. “If the BEP does not meet the order, the BEP does not get paid.” The financial toll from the recent bungle is tough to know: the Treasury and the Fed have little interest in calculating it, let alone being transparent about it. Still, the direct cost probably isn’t greater than the sum of what the bureau pumps out in a few days. “Central banks are a bit like other businesses,” said Ben Mazzotta, a researcher at the Fletcher School’s Institute for Business in the Global Context who focusses on the costs of different forms of money. “They can draw down inventories or order additional product.” There are other costs, though. Taxpayers will have to pay to inspect, correct, produce, transport, and secure all the additional money that will replace the botched notes. Disposing of the bad bills? That’s on taxpayers, too, as are the additional hours spent making up for the mistake by employees of the bureau. A possible greater cost of these scrip shenanigans is diminished confidence in the greenback. The situation is akin to a magician getting caught unloading a crate of bunnies from the back of his truck. It threatens to injure the aura—the almightiness—of the dollar that enables most people to go about their business without ever stopping to examine the bills in their hand or to contemplate what gives them value. The only thing conferring value on those dollars, of course, is trust in other people’s trust in them, which is both weird and magnificent. David Wolman is a contributing editor at Wired.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common.

She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about.

David has to find out which tips are most useful for him. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which tip the skeletal muscle would not be bigger, tip A or tip B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is important to first understand the primary difference between tip A and tip B. Tip A involves weight lifting, while tip B does not involve weight lifting. When determining which tip is less likely to result in bigger skeletal muscles, it is essential to take into account the effect of the exercise type on muscle growth. Muscle hypertrophy, or the increase in muscle size, occurs when the body adapts to external stress, such as resistance training. This process involves the growth of muscle fibers and the number of muscle cells, leading to increased muscle mass. Weight lifting, as part of tip A, is a form of resistance training that specifically targets the development of muscle strength and size. By breaking down and rebuilding muscle fibers, weight lifting stimulates muscle growth, resulting in an increase in skeletal muscle size. On the other hand, tip B does not involve weight lifting. While the exact form of exercise involved in tip B is not specified in the paragraph, it is clear that it does not include resistance training. As a result, tip B is less likely to focus on promoting muscle growth. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the skeletal muscles would not be bigger in tip B compared to tip A. It is important for David to understand his personal fitness goals and to consult his personal trainer to determine the most appropriate exercise routine to achieve those goals, as the utility of the different tips will ultimately depend on his individual needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: This task is about writing a correct answer for the reading comprehension task. Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\".

Usage: The shortest continuous text span from the passage that answers the given question. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Sample response: \\"UK, Italy and Australia (3197)\\" - This meets the criteria because it directly states the lockout chip number for the UK, Italy, and Australia as requested in the question. Part #2: Using information from a given passage. Usage: Base your answer on the information provided in the passage. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Sample response: \\"UK, Italy and Australia (3197)\\" - This response meets the criteria because it is a direct quote from the passage, ensuring that the information is accurate and relevant to the question.

Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.

Simply double the ingredients to make 2 cups of coffee instead of 1. Continue adding ingredients in proportion to make the amount of coffee you want. Use the coffee’s weight to quickly find out how much water to use. Measure the coffee’s weight in ounces using a scale, then multiply that number by 16. This tells you how many fluid ounces of water you need. For grams, multiply the coffee’s weight by 16.6945. This gives you the amount of cubic centimeters of water to use. Everyone enjoys coffee in a different way, so the standard cup may taste weak to you. If this is the case, add some extra beans or a small scoop of grounds to your next brew. As long as you keep the amount of water the same, the coffee will come out stronger. For weaker coffee, use the normal amount of grounds or beans. Add more water to dilute the taste. Keep track of how much water you add so that you can recreate the perfect cup of coffee after you figure out what ratio works best for you. Coffee comes in a variety of flavors, so find the one that best suits your taste. Then change the amount of grounds, beans, or water you use to adjust the coffee’s strength.

Information: - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey . - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability. - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies. - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What were the names of the two overdrive pedals used by Mudhoney? , can you please find it? Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Yesterday, after months of speculation, David Fincher announced that he’d cast Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.” Some people are sighing with relief that the role didn’t go to a rumored big name like Scarlett Johansson or Kristen Stewart. But others are wondering who the heck this girl is. If you even vaguely recognize her name, it’s probably from her biggest role to date, as Nancy, the brunette waitress and female lead in the recent “Nightmare on Elm Street” remake. Check out her acting chops in the preview above. And after the jump, all there is to know about Rooney, along with clips and interviews. First, the biographical deets. Mara is 24 and originally hails from Bedford, New York, a richie town in Westchester County. Her grandpops founded the New York Giants and her uncle co-owns the team. She is one of four children and is a bit of a humanitarian. After high school, she founded a charity for orphans in Kenya called Faces of Kiberia. In an interview with Paper magazine, she said, “I needed to get out of the bubble of Westchester. I wanted to finish high school and experience other parts of the world before I tried acting.” Rooney went on to college in NYU were she studied psychology and social policy. And than took off for L.A. three years ago to join her sister, Kate Mara, in the acting game. One of her first roles was in “Dare,” a flick starring Emmy Rossum and Zach Gilford. Here’s an interview she did about the movie. In “Dare,” Rooney played the popular girl, but she swears she was nothing like that in high school. “I was mostly just shy and had few friends,” she says. She also dishes that she prefers independent films to big studio productions. Oops! But something about her skittishness and monotone voice is kind of endearing, no? Last year, Rooney landed a role in Michael Cera’s “Youth in Revolt,” as a coed trying to sleep with 50 men. She also played a boarding school student carrying on an affair with an older man in “Tanner Hall.” See Rooney and hear more of her deadpan humor in the trailer below. And then, of course, came “Nightmare on Elm Street.” In the interview below, Rooney describes her character, a disturbed girl who actually seems a bit like Lisbeth. What do we think of the sweatshirt with one arm missing? Rooney has actually worked with David Fincher before. She has a bit part in “The Social Network,” his upcoming flick about Facebook. She plays the girl who broke Mark Zuckerberg’s heart. She doesn’t get much time in the preview, but she’s the wide-eyed brunette at 2:01. Interestingly, Rooney told Collider.com that she was nervous to work with Fincher the first time around because he’s known for being uber-demanding. “I was a little worried about [all the takes he does]. Am I going to feel stale? But it never felt like that. His notes are so specific and what he wants is so specific that every time we did it, it felt fresh and new and in the moment.” And she must have impressed him for him to then cast her as Lisbeth. A writer at Entertainment Weekly notes that Fincher drummed up press for the Lisbeth decision by “turning his whole casting process into a kind of role-of-the-century Cinderella event, a contemporary version of the search for Scarlett O’Hara.” They note that Rooney looks an awful lot like Scarlett O’Hara. Which, on second glance, she totally does. But do we think this movie will be big on a “Gone With The Wind” scale? [Daily Beast] [EW] ||||| Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic It has been decided. Rooney Mara just landed the role of a lifetime as Lisbeth Salander in the much-hyped American version of Stieg Larsson's novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She's set to star alongside Daniel Craig and Robin Wright in the cult favorite book-turned-flick. We think it should also be starring Kristen Stewart, but alas, we digress. So, the one question we've got now is...Who the hell is Rooney Mara?! 1. She's got famous relatives but humble beginnings: Mara, 25, attended New York University and studied psychology and social policy before pursuing a career in acting. Her great-grandfathers founded the New York Giants and the Pittsburgh Steelers, and her older sister, Kate Mara, is an actress with film credits including Iron Man 2, Brokeback Mountain and brief stints in 24, Entourage and Nip/Tuck. 2. You've seen her before...probably: After some bit parts in television shows like ER and Law & Order: SVU and a few small-time movies, Rooney recreated iconic heroine Nancy Holbrook in the 2010 reboot of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Critics were generally meh on the flick, but didn't completely discount Mara's performance as the gal who carried the film, which is arguably the closest role she's played to Lisbeth. 3. You'll see her again...real soon, this time: Mara has a leading role in The Social Network, you know, that movie about Facebook starring Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake. In the opening scene, she breaks up with her boyfriend, Mark Zuckerberg, who later goes on to found Facebook. The film involved some major Hollywood bigwigs behind the scenes, like Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher (who's directing Dragon Tattoo), so get ready to see Rooney stretch her acting chops before buying your ticket for Dragon. 4. She oversees her own charity: Mara is the chief overseer for Faces of Kibera, a charity she began to provide food, shelter and medical care for orphans in the Kenyan neighborhood of Kibera. At 21, she had already studied nonprofits in college and began the organization to build an orphanage in the province. Despite her blossoming acting career, she says she'll keep doing the Good Samaritan thing as well. 5. She beat out tons of A-listers to get this role: Let's face it: It seemed like every young actress in Tinseltown was vying for this role. Just a few of the high-profile names Rooney was in competiont against: Ellen Page, Carey Mulligan, Natalie Portman and Alice in Wonderland's Mia Wasikowska. Also on the short list for the part, and with a rather large constituency supporting her, was Twilight's Kristen Stewart. We were in the Kristen camp, but now that the part's officially gone to Mara, we'll bide our time and wait to see how she handles the role. Let's face it: Daniel Craig's no Robert Pattinson, after all. Follow @theawfultruth and @snarc on Twitter! _______ We've got all the casting gossip for you right here! ||||| UPDATE: Sony Pictures Entertainment has issued a press release on Mara. I’ve included it after Deadline’s story break. EXCLUSIVE: Ending one of the most drawn out and closely watched casting searches for an actress in years, Sony Pictures Entertainment and director David Fincher have chosen Rooney Mara to play Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the film that begins shooting this fall in Sweden, with Daniel Craig starring. The film will be released December 21, 2011. Rooney was considered Fincher’s first choice in the process: the director had just helmed her in The Social Network. Closing a deal will amount to a formality, because Mara essentially agreed to terms when she and other young actresses signed on to tests that Fincher and producer Scott Rudin have conducted over the past several weeks. Her deal includes an option for two sequels that will cover The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest, the second and third books in the Millennium Trilogy by the late author Stieg Larsson. The books continue the same murder conspiracy storyline. Deadline revealed that Craig was signed a deal with two options weeks ago to play Mikael Blomkvist, the investigative journalist and part owner of the magazine Millennium, and Deadline also broke the story that Robin Wright was in talks to play Erika Berger, his occasional bed partner and the publisher of Millennium. Stellan Skarsgard was also reportedly in talks to play Martin Vanger, who joins the magazine’s board. The search for Salander has been the role that really captured the public fancy. Slight of frame and short, Salander is a brilliant but troubled computer hacker who helps Blomkvist unravel a decades-long murder mystery. The storyline is as dark as the subject matter that Fincher tackled in Seven, and subsequent books establish Salander as far more than Blomkvist’s sidekick (and occasional lover). While established actresses have been named as being in contention for the role — Natalie Portman (who tried to buy the books early on), Ellen Page (who filmed her own test), Carey Mulligan and most recently Scarlett Johansson — Fincher has focused his testing process on discovering an actress who fits Salander physically and in age proximity, which is early 20s. Mara was among a group of young actresses that included Alice In Wonderland star Mia Wasikowska, Sucker Punch’s Emily Browning (even though neither actress signed test deals), Fish Tank’s Katie Jarvis. Mara tested along with Sophie Lowe, Sarah Snook and French actress Lea Seydoux. Mara is a strong match: she is the right age and looks like Salander. She also had the advantage of working with Fincher and Rudin on The Social Network. The sister of Brokeback Mountain‘s Kate Mara and the great granddaughter of New York Giants football team founder Wellington Mara and Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney, Mara was most recently seen in the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Mara is repped by WME. (Culver City, August 16, 2010) — Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have been cast in the lead roles of Columbia Pictures’ three-picture adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s literary blockbuster The Millennium Trilogy under the direction of David Fincher. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo – the first film of the series, which also includes The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest – begins shooting next month in Sweden. The screenplay is written by Steve Zaillian and the film is being produced by Scott Rudin, Cean Chaffin, Ole Sondberg and Søren Stærmose. Mikael Wallen and Anni Fernandez are executive producers. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is set for worldwide release December 21, 2011. The Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson has been published in 44 countries and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide thus far. In the U.S. alone, the series has sold over 10 million copies, and the sales were recently calculated at the remarkable rate of one book per second. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has broken sales records in virtually every country in which it has been published. It has sold over 5 million copies in the U.S. and has out-sold any other e-book in that rapidly expanding market. A literary phenomenon, all three books currently sit atop the New York Times Best Seller lists. In describing the scale of Larsson’s achievement, The Economist said: “Stieg Larsson’s vivid characters, the depth of the detail across the three books, the powerfully imaginative plot, and the sheer verve of the writing make the trilogy a masterpiece of its genre.” Michiko Kakutani, of The New York Times, described the Lisbeth character: “Lisbeth Salander, Stieg Larsson’s fierce pixie of a heroine, is one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while – a gamin, Audrey Hepburn look-alike but with tattoos and piercings, the take-no-prisoners attitude of Lara Croft and the cool, unsentimental intellect of Mr. Spock. She is the vulnerable victim turned vigilante; a willfully antisocial girl . . . who has proved herself to be as incandescently proficient as any video game warrior.” The three novels have all become #1 worldwide bestsellers, an achievement unrivaled in trade book publishing. DAVID FINCHER most recently directed this fall’s much-anticipated The Social Network for Columbia Pictures, which opens in the U.S. on October 1st. DANIEL CRAIG recently starred in the two highest-grossing films in the James Bond franchise, Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale. His earlier film roles include Munich, Enduring Love, Layer Cake, The Mother, Road to Perdition, and Some Voices. He has also recently completed filming on Jim Sheridan’s Dream House, Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, and Jon Favreau’s Cowboys & Aliens.

Embarking on this journey is a conscious decision to immortalize your passion, your experiences, or the people you hold close to your heart. It's a statement, an armor you wear proudly on your skin. Therefore, creating the perfect tattoo sleeve involves careful planning, personalization, and collaboration with a skilled tattoo artist. In this guide, we will discuss how to choose the right images and symbols, work through sessions, explore continuity and color, and ultimately create a masterpiece that's an extension of your inner self. 1. Choosing Images and Symbols That Matter Most to You The first step in creating your tattoo sleeve is to brainstorm and explore images and symbols that hold personal significance. It's essential to dig deep, focus on your values, and consider your inspirations. You may find relevance in family crests, cultural designs, religious icons, or even illustrations of your favorite characters. Reflect on your life's important milestones, experiences you've had, or beliefs you firmly stand for, as these will lay the groundwork for your tattoo sleeve's theme. Make a list, draw out your ideas, or collect visual references to better envision your design. By focusing on images and symbols of personal meaning, your tattoo sleeve will inherently be unique and resonate with your essence. 2. Working in Sessions: Taking Your Time to Create the Perfect Sleeve Once you've gathered a collection of ideas, don't rush to get everything tattooed in one sitting. Breaking the process down into multiple sessions allows for a more refined design that accounts for several factors such as the natural contours of your body, pain tolerance, and healing time. It also ensures there's room for new ideas or modifications that evolve throughout the process. In collaboration with your chosen tattoo artist, break down the design into separate stages. Generally, tattoo artists will start with the outline, followed by shading and filling in, and finally, adding color. Depending on the complexity and size of your design, other stages might be necessary. Remember, great tattoos require patience. Allow each segment to heal before continuing the process. Proper healing will prevent complications and unwanted distortions of your intricate masterpiece. 3. Incorporating Patterns and Motifs for Continuity A well-designed tattoo sleeve possesses harmony and fluidity, where each individual piece seamlessly flows into the next. To achieve this visual cohesion, consider incorporating patterns or motifs that tie together different elements while maintaining a symmetry of sorts. Some popular choices include traditional tribal patterns, geometric shapes, floral motifs, or traditional Japanese elements. Think of how these patterns can be used as backgrounds, fillers, or foreground elements to create a sense of unity amidst various symbols. By weaving these motifs through your design, you create a stunning work of art while simultaneously maintaining the significance of each individual image. 4. Choosing Colors for Consistency and Personal Style Color is an essential element to consider while planning your tattoo sleeve. Your selected palette will contribute to the overall aesthetic and play a significant role in expressing your personality. To ensure consistency, stick to a limited color palette that's easily replicable by your tattoo artist. Explore color combinations that resonate with you and complement the design elements. You can opt for vibrant and bold colors or choose softer shades for a more subtle look. Discuss with your tattoo artist the types of ink they use and how those particular colors age over time. Your goal should be to have a color palette that maintains its vibrancy and allure even as time goes on. 5. Collaborating with a Skilled Tattoo Artist Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, selecting a skilled and experienced tattoo artist is crucial to turning your vision into a reality. Research and explore various artist portfolios to find someone who resonates with your desired style and has experience in executing sleeve tattoos. Share your ideas, sketches, and reference materials with your chosen artist during the consultation process. Together, you can create a design exclusively tailored to your taste and preferences. An experienced tattoo artist not only possesses technical skill but will also provide sound advice regarding the design, placement, and other aspects of your sleeve. Trust and open communication between you and your artist will undoubtedly pave the way for a breathtaking tattoo that exceeds your expectations. Conclusion Creating the perfect tattoo sleeve is a journey filled with reflection, creativity, and patience. Embark on this adventure with a clear vision, an open mind, and a skilled tattoo artist by your side. Your tattoo sleeve will be an expressive masterpiece that stands as a tribute to your story, your ideals, and your unique essence for all to witness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are strong arguments on either side — both for and against clipping. Those who caution against it say that birds were meant to fly and we should not interfere with a parrot’s natural inclinations. Clipping the parrot's wings deprives them of this basic freedom. Consider other options first. If you are planning to show your bird, it should never be clipped. Parrots respond very well to clicker training, and you can train your parrot to return to you when called. You can also use clicker training to modify unwanted behaviors, which can help your parrot stay happy and safe. If you are not willing to do the work to train a parrot, then you may want to reconsider if getting a bird is right for you. There are some dangers to letting your bird fly free in your home. They can potentially damage their feathers, knock things over, and consume things that they should not. Many household items can be dangerous to parrots, including toilets and other standing water, lightbulbs and stoves that get hot, ceiling fans, cords to blinds, and windows and mirrors. Ask yourself why you want a bird if you don't want it to fly or don't feel that your home is a safe environment. Consider that a different pet may be more appropriate. Parrots are quick and can take advantage of any open door or window to get out. Once outside, it may be difficult to get bird back if you have not trained them. With clipped wings, the chance of escape is reduced. And if your bird does get out, it’s much easier to get them back. Bird wings should not be clipped until the bird can fly. Clipping too early can stunt the regular growth of the feathers. If you’ve never done it before, it’s advisable to have your vet do it the first time. That way you can see how it works and then decide if you want to continue to do it at home. Summary:","completion":"Clipping a parrot's wings is a controversial issue with strong arguments on either side, as it can deprive birds of their natural inclination to fly, yet reduce chances of escape and injury; proper training and considering alternative pets are crucial factors for potential bird owners to consider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Where do the South Korean SWAT officers later adjourn to? Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: An elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. It is revealed that Park...

They scramble against time to find and disarm the explosives, while also trying to uncover the true intentions of Park Mu-young and the North Korean sleeper agents. Throughout this tense situation, the SWAT officers would likely come together at their headquarters or a designated secure location after completing their missions or gathering new information. This is a common practice to regroup, discuss their findings, strategize, and prepare for their next course of action.

Given the question: Given the following passage \\"According to a National Geographic article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because \\"she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame\\".

Chihuahua (state): After the death of the president Benito Juárez in 1872, the first magistracy of the country was occupied by the vice-president Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, who called for new elections. Two candidates were registered; Lerdo de Tejada and General Porfirio Díaz, one of the heroes of the Battle of Puebla which had taken place on May 5, 1862. Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio Díaz rebelled against President Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. The Plan of Tuxtepec defended the \\"No Re-election\\" principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio Díaz; Governor Antonio Ochoa was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio Díaz then helped Tíras regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jose Maria Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio Díaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877. During the first years of the Porfiriato (Porfirio Díaz Era), the Díaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte. Please answer a question about this article.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right.

She is the same age as Alan Kurdi, the Syrian boy whose body washed up last week on a Turkish beach. Soon she will take her place in an overcrowded smuggler's dinghy just as he did. Her doting father, Mounib Zakiya, plans to take his children and grandchildren from the Jordanian capital to the Turkish coast, to be smuggled into Europe. He says he is leaving Amman, after three years, for one reason - his meagre aid has been cut off. \\"It's safe here,\\" said the former estate agent, \\"and life is good. But we have to buy food and milk for the children. We have to pay for medical care. How can I pay the rent?\\" His family of nine was living on about 1 (Â£0.65) a day per person. Now even that has gone. He says the United Nations and the international community are forcing him to risk all on the open seas. \\"They bear 75% of the responsibility,\\" he said, cradling Rana on his lap. \\"They have opened a gate to death, and are making us walk through it. \\"It's better to die fast on the journey, than die slowly, watching your kids starve.\\" Mr Zakiya is one of many Syrian refugees in Jordan who have lost their lifeline. For months the World Food Programme (WFP) has been cutting aid to the bone due to a lack of donations. It reduced the monthly stipend for about 211,000 Syrians by half. At the beginning of September it went further. Almost 230,000 Syrian refugees - living in cities, not camps - had their aid stopped entirely. Help is still being provided for 100,000 living in camps, but there, too, funds could run out in November. Aid workers say that if refugees cannot get help where they are, they will risk their lives to find it elsewhere. \\"If people were receiving enough assistance and were able to have a somewhat stable life where they are, they would not make that decision,\\" said the WFP's Dina El-Kassaby. \\"But unfortunately, some people are pushed to the edge.\\" Adnan Ghanoum is one of them. The former factory owner from Damascus, aged 61, is weighed down with worries about his extended family. He has 19 relatives living with him in Amman, including a disabled daughter. Mr Ghanoum says he almost had a heart attack when he read the SMS saying his aid was ending. \\"We have no future here in Jordan,\\" he said. \\"There is no education, no work, and no money. We have been eating flour and onions for a week.\\" He is now thinking of returning to the war zone from which he fled. \\"It's better to go back to Syria to die there,\\" he said, \\"and rest in peace.\\" If he goes back home, he will not be the only one. Aid agencies say the numbers returning to Syria have doubled since the cuts began. And the flow of refugees from Jordan to Europe is expected to increase substantially. Western governments are partly to blame because they did not provide enough support in the region, according to one senior aid worker. He says it would have \\"made sense\\" for Europe to invest here but there was \\"penny-pinching and ineptitude\\". Mounib Zakiya says he and his family would stay in Jordan, if their aid was restored. But he has already packed blankets and winter clothing for their journey to Europe. He knows they could perish on the way - just like his old neighbours from Syria who drowned two weeks ago. The family of five slipped beneath the waves as they tried to cross the Aegean Sea. \\"If we die, I hope it will be on the TV and everyone will see it,\\" he said sombrely. \\"Then maybe they will find a solution for Syria.\\" Summary:","completion":"Syrian refugee families in Jordan, like Mounib Zakiya's, are struggling to survive after aid from the World Food Programme has been cut due to insufficient donations. With even their meager income gone, some refugees are considering returning to war-torn Syria or attempting risky journeys to Europe in search of a better life. Aid workers warn that if refugees cannot find help where they are, they will risk their lives to find it elsewhere. The situation has led to an increase in Syrians returning to their homeland and a projected increase in refugees attempting to reach Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Skookum cat was developed from intersections between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a lurid cat with a short coat . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"These two sentences, though they bear a resemblance, do not convey the same meaning. I will analyze them both for a more comprehensive understanding. In the first sentence: \\"The Skookum cat was developed from crosses between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a short-legged cat with a curly coat.\\" Here, this sentence implies that the Skookum cat is a breed that was formed through crossbreeding between Munchkin and LaPerm cats. The primary objective was to produce a cat with short legs (from the Munchkin breed) and a curly coat (from the LaPerm breed). The sentence offers a clear and accurate description of what the breeders intended to achieve through this particular cross. In the second sentence: \\"The Skookum cat was developed from intersections between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a lurid cat with a short coat.\\" This sentence still indicates that the Skookum cat is a result of crossbreeding between Munchkin and LaPerm cats. However, it states that the goal was to create a \\"lurid\\" cat. The term \\"lurid\\" can mean vivid in color, shocking, or sensational. Given the context, it is unclear what the author intends this term to convey, rendering it ambiguous. Moreover, the sentence mentions that the intended outcome was a short coat, which is not the objective of creating a Skookum cat. The intended goal, as seen in the first sentence, should be the creation of a cat with a curly coat. In summary, the first sentence clearly and accurately conveys the desired outcome of crossbreeding Munchkin and LaPerm cats to produce the Skookum cat breed. In contrast, the second sentence appears to provide an inaccurate description of the intended purpose, leading to confusion about the specific traits the breeders aimed to develop.

To do this, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation: 1x - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5 Step 5: Simplify the equation: 1x = 5 Step 6: Now that we have isolated x, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 1: 1x / 1 = 5 / 1 Step 7: Simplify the equation: x = 5 So, the solution to the equation is x = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Summarize: Nicola Sturgeon said it was \\"democratically unacceptable\\" that Scotland faced the prospect of being taken out of the EU against its will. She said the Scottish government would begin preparing legislation to enable another independence vote. Scotland voted in favour of the UK staying in the EU by 62% to 38%. The UK as a whole has voted to leave, by a margin of 52% to 48%, prompting UK Prime Minister David Cameron to announce he would stand down by October. The SNP manifesto for May's Holyrood elections said the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was a \\"significant and material change\\" in the circumstances that prevailed at the time of the 2014 referendum, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. At a news conference in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: \\"It is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.\\" It looks \\"highly likely\\", says Nicola Sturgeon, that there will now be a second referendum upon Scottish independence. Is she enthused by this prospect? Does she thrill at the notion? Is she buffing up her best lines from 2014? The answers to those questions would be no, no and, once again, no. To be clear, for the avoidance of any doubt, Nicola Sturgeon remains rather keen on the concept of Scottish independence. Indeed, she yearns for it. She knows that means another referendum at some point in the future. But not now. Not in these circumstances. Not in these troubled times. Read more of Brian's blog Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish cabinet would meet on Saturday and she would make a statement to MSPs on Tuesday. The first minister said there was now a significant divergence between Scotland and the rest of Britain which she \\"deeply regretted\\". A majority of voters in all 32 council areas in Scotland voted Remain. Area-by-area in maps: See how people voted Speaking at her official residence, Bute House, she said: \\"I intend to take all possible steps and explore all possible options to give effect to how people in Scotland voted - in other words to secure our continuing place in the EU, and in the single market in particular.\\" Asked if there were any other options available to the Scottish government, she replied: \\"I think an independence referendum is now highly likely but I also think it is important that we take time to consider all steps and have the discussions, not least to assess the response of the European Union to the vote that Scotland expressed yesterday.\\" She also revealed she had spoken to London Mayor Sadiq Khan since the result and that he shared, for London, the desire to remain in the EU. \\"There is clear common cause between us,\\" she said. BBC Scotland took to the streets of towns and cities across the country to find out what people felt about the decision to leave the EU. Ms Sturgeon said: \\"After a campaign that has been characterised in the rest of the UK by fear and hate, my priority in the days, weeks and months ahead will be to act at all times in the best interests of Scotland and in a way that unites, not divides us. \\"Let me be clear about this. Whatever happens as a result of this outcome, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will always be Scotland's closest neighbours and our best friends - nothing will change that. \\"But I want to leave no-one in any doubt about this. I am proud of Scotland and how we voted yesterday. \\"We proved that we are a modern, outward looking and inclusive country and we said clearly that we do not want to leave the European Union. \\"I am determine to do what it takes to make sure these aspirations are realised.\\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she shared Ms Sturgeon's disappointment at the result - but she did not believe it justified holding another independence referendum. In a statement she said: \\"Like the first minister I want to see stability prioritised in the days ahead. Scotland will open for business next week in the same way as it closes today. \\"But I do not believe that a second independence referendum will help us achieve that stability nor that it is in the best interests of the people of Scotland.\\" Ms Davidson added that addressing the challenges of leaving the EU should not mean \\"leaving our own Union of nations\\". She said she believed in Scotland's place within the UK \\"today as much as ever.\\" Scottish Labour Leader Kezia Dugdale said the result was bad for jobs and the economy in Scotland and across the UK. She added that she would be ready to work with Ms Sturgeon in the \\"best interests of the people of Scotland\\". However, Ms Dugdale said she did not want to see a second Scottish independence referendum. She explained: \\"On the question of independence, many of the fundamental questions that were unresolved and unanswered in 2014, remain so. Not least the question of currency. What we don't need today is more turmoil, more upheaval and more economic chaos.\\" Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, said he would meet the Scottish government to ensure it was \\"fully involved\\" in negotiations surrounding the UK's withdrawal from the EU. Responding to suggestions that the result could trigger a second independence referendum, he said now was \\"a time for calmness and deliberation, not pushing other personal or political agendas\\". Scotland's only UKIP MEP David Coburn said it was \\"fantastic\\" that \\"we're out\\". He added: \\"Whatever nonsense Nicola is coming out with, all this nonsense of another referendum, another neverendum - she's talking through her hat - because 40% of the population don't want anything to do with the EU.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he was \\"angry that we have lost our place in Europe\\". He said: \\"It is bad for our country and the people who live here. It means cutting our ties with our biggest economic market despite the consequences for trade, business, jobs and incomes.\\" Scottish Green co-convenor Patrick Harvie said Scotland \\"must keep open every option for protecting ourselves from this threat\\".","completion":"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that a second referendum for Scottish independence is \\"highly likely\\" as a result of the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union in the recent Brexit referendum. She argued that it was \\"democratically unacceptable\\" for Scotland to be taken out of the EU against its wish - as 62% of voters in Scotland voted in favour of remaining in the bloc. Consequently, the Scottish government will begin the process of preparing legislation that would enable another vote on independence. Sturgeon urged discussion and consideration of all options in assessing Scotland's continuing position within the European Union and the single market. Additionally, she emphasized Scotland's efforts to remain an integral part of the UK, despite the political turmoil experienced following the EU referendum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the rich and sudden wisdom ,","completion":"The given sentence, \\"the rich and sudden wisdom,\\" doesn't contain clear negative or positive sentiment. It's neutral because it's just describing wisdom as being rich and sudden. Sentiment analysis needs to have clear indicators of emotion or sentiment associated with it to evaluate it as positive or negative. In sentiment analysis, we primarily look for words or phrases that generally express happiness, joy, satisfaction, love, or excitement for positive sentiment. On the other hand, words or phrases that express sadness, anger, hate, dissatisfaction or frustration are perceived as indicators of negative sentiment. However, interpreting the sentiment of a sentence can also depend heavily on the context in which it is used. Without any background or additional information, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. \\"Rich and sudden wisdom\\" associates \\"wisdom\\" with being \\"rich\\" - normally perceived as a positive attribute. \\"Sudden\\" can be seen as either positive (if the wisdom is needed immediately or comes unexpectedly but is beneficial) or negative (if it's unexpected and overwhelming or leads to unforeseen ramifications). Because this sentence might take on different sentiments based on the situation, it really requires more context. For example, if the full sentence was, \\"They experienced a rich and sudden wisdom that saved them from making a huge mistake,\\" this would be perceived as having a positive sentiment. Conversely, \\"The rich and sudden wisdom was too overwhelming for them to handle\\" would have a negative sentiment. However, in the absence of context, we default to viewing the provided sentence as neutral. In conclusion, without any other information or context, \\"the rich and sudden wisdom\\" is taken as neutral because there are no certain indicators of emotion that would direct us to consider this sentence either positively or negatively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist. - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair. - Pharmacology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\". - Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Anakinra ( brand name Kineret ) is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis . It is an interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) receptor antagonist . - A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered organ located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \\"hand\\" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \\"hands\\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \\"hands\\" though opposable thumbs are lacking. - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms. The cause is not entirely clear. It is believed to involve hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. There is no cure for SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful. Rates of disease vary between countries from 20 to 70 per 100,000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of... - Efficacy is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as, and for practical purposes is synonymous with, \\"effectiveness\\". It is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer to both the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings. - Lupus erythematosus is a name given to a collection of autoimmune diseases in which the human immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissues. Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus. - Alpha-blockers or -blockers are pharmacological agents that act as neutral antagonists or inverse agonists of -adrenergic receptors (-adrenoceptors). - A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active orthosteric (= right place) site or to allosteric (= other place) sites on receptors, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonistreceptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonistreceptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of otherwise unrelated drugs defined by their use in rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The term is often used in contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (which refers to agents that treat the inflammation but not the underlying cause) and steroids (which blunt the immune response but are insufficient to slow down the progression of the disease). - Calcium channel blockers (CCB), calcium channel antagonists or calcium antagonists are several medications that disrupt the movement of calcium through calcium channels. Calcium channel blockers are used as antihypertensive drugs, i.e., as medications to decrease blood pressure in patients with hypertension. CCBs are particularly effective against large vessel stiffness, one of the common causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in elderly patients. Calcium channel blockers are also frequently used to alter heart rate, to prevent cerebral vasospasm, and to reduce chest pain caused by angina pectoris. N-type, L-type, and T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are present in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, and CCBs can directly influence the biosynthesis of aldosterone in adrenocortical cells, with consequent impact on the clinical treatment of hypertension with these agents. - A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. - In the field of pharmacology, an inverse agonist is an agent that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that agonist. A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either. - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - In biochemistry, a binding site is a region on a protein or piece of DNA or RNA to which ligands (specific molecules and/or ions) may form a chemical bond. An equilibrium exists between unbound ligands and bound ligands. - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. - In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus; and (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as \\"wrist joints\\". This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - Psoriatic arthritis (also arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that will develop in between 6 and 42% of people who have the chronic skin condition psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Approximately 60% of those affected have the tissue type HLA-B27. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (17721840) was a French surgeon best known for his description of rheumatoid arthritis. Born in Orléans, he studied under Pierre-Joseph Desault and Marie François Xavier Bichat in Paris, and then from 1792 under Jean Louis Petit in Lyon. In 1796 he obtained an internship at the famed Salpêtrière Hospital, where he assisted Philippe Pinel. He was appointed professor of clinical medicine at the Salpêtrière in 1799. After the restoration, he also held the professorship at the Paris polytechnic school. He was removed in 1830 at the insistence of King Louis-Philippe of France.

But all that was behind them now. All charges against them had been dropped, and Cynthia's husband had been buried. And the rumors would have died down eventually if they had gone their separate ways. They could feel the stares as they walked to their table. Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best. Mama Castilla had run the place for over thirty years. She had taken over for her grandfather in 1973. A sign on the wall said so. Cynthia ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo. Greg went with his favorite, the Chicken Parmesan. Both ordered iced tea and salad. The bread and olive oil with roasted garlic and pepper came with every meal. Greg could not resist great bread. And this was the best. He tore off a chunk as soon as the waitress delivered it. Cynthia would wait for the salad. \\"So we're finally on a real date,\\" said Greg. \\"Yeah.

Here’s what’s behind the unbelievable numbers. It was a balmy afternoon last July when the call came in: Dead body found inside empty warehouse on the West Side. Chicago police officers drove through an industrial stretch of the hardscrabble Austin neighborhood and pulled up to the 4600 block of West Arthington Street. The warehouse in question was an unremarkable-looking red-brick single-story building with a tall barbed-wire fence. Vacant for six years, it had been visited that day by its owner and a real-estate agent—the person who had called 911. Also In This Special Report The Truth About Chicago’s Crime Rates: Part 2 One Year Later, CPD’s New Tricks: Part 3 Editor’s Note: On Accuracy The place lacked electricity, so crime scene technicians set up generators and portable lights. The power flickered on to reveal a grisly sight. In a small office, on soggy carpeting covered in broken ceiling tiles, lay a naked, lifeless woman. She had long red-streaked black hair and purple glitter nail polish on her left toenails (her right ones were gone), but beyond that it was hard to discern much. Her face and body were bloated and badly decomposed, her hands ash colored. Maggots feasted on her flesh. At the woman’s feet, detectives found a curled strand of telephone wire. Draped over her right hand was a different kind of wire: thin and brown. The same brown wire was wrapped around each armrest of a wooden chair next to her. The following day, July 24, a pathologist in the Cook County medical examiner’s office noticed something else that had been obscured by rotting skin: a thin gag tied around the corpse’s mouth. Advertisement Thanks to some still-visible tattoos, detectives soon identified this unfortunate woman: Tiara Groves, a 20-year-old from Austin. She was last seen walking alone in the wee hours of Sunday, July 14, near a liquor store two miles from the warehouse. At least eight witnesses who saw her that night told police a similar story: She appeared drunk and was upset—one man said that she was crying so hard she couldn’t catch her breath—but refused offers of help. A man who talked to her outside the liquor store said that Groves warned him, excitedly and incoherently, that he should stay away from her or else somebody (she didn’t say who) would kill him too. Toxicology tests showed she had heroin and alcohol in her system, but not enough to kill her. All signs pointed to foul play. According to the young woman’s mother, who had filed a missing-person report, the police had no doubt. “When this detective came to my house, he said, ‘We found your daughter. . . . Your daughter has been murdered,’ ” Alice Groves recalls. “He told me they’re going to get the one that did it.” On October 28, a pathologist ruled the death of Tiara Groves a homicide by “unspecified means.” This rare ruling means yes, somebody had killed Groves, but the pathologist couldn’t pinpoint the exact cause of death. Given the finding of homicide—and the corroborating evidence at the crime scene—the Chicago Police Department should have counted Groves’s death as a murder. And it did. Until December 18. On that day, the police report indicates, a lieutenant overseeing the Groves case reclassified the homicide investigation as a noncriminal death investigation. In his writeup, he cited the medical examiner’s “inability to determine a cause of death.” That lieutenant was Denis Walsh—the same cop who had played a crucial role in the alleged cover-up in the 2004 killing of David Koschman, the 21-year-old who died after being punched by a nephew of former mayor Richard M. Daley. Walsh allegedly took the Koschman file home. For years, police officials said that it was lost. After the Sun-Times reported it missing, the file mysteriously reappeared. But back to Tiara Groves. With the stroke of a computer key, she was airbrushed out of Chicago’s homicide statistics. The change stunned officers. Current and former veteran detectives who reviewed the Groves case at Chicago’s request were just as incredulous. Says a retired high-level detective, “How can you be tied to a chair and gagged, with no clothes on, and that’s a [noncriminal] death investigation?” (He, like most of the nearly 40 police sources interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name, citing fears of disciplinary action or other retribution.) Was it just a coincidence, some wondered, that the reclassification occurred less than two weeks before the end of the year, when the city of Chicago’s final homicide numbers for 2013 would be tallied? “They essentially wiped away one of the murders in the city, which is crazy,” says a police insider. “But that’s the kind of shit that’s going on.” For the case of Tiara Groves is not an isolated one. Chicago conducted a 12-month examination of the Chicago Police Department’s crime statistics going back several years, poring through public and internal police records and interviewing crime victims, criminologists, and police sources of various ranks. We identified 10 people, including Groves, who were beaten, burned, suffocated, or shot to death in 2013 and whose cases were reclassified as death investigations, downgraded to more minor crimes, or even closed as noncriminal incidents—all for illogical or, at best, unclear reasons. Advertisement This troubling practice goes far beyond murders, documents and interviews reveal. Chicago found dozens of other crimes, including serious felonies such as robberies, burglaries, and assaults, that were misclassified, downgraded to wrist-slap offenses, or made to vanish altogether. (We’ll examine those next month in part 2 of this special report.) Many officers of different ranks and from different parts of the city recounted instances in which they were asked or pressured by their superiors to reclassify their incident reports or in which their reports were changed by some invisible hand. One detective refers to the “magic ink”: the power to make a case disappear. Says another: “The rank and file don’t agree with what’s going on. The powers that be are making the changes.” Granted, a few dozen crimes constitute a tiny percentage of the more than 300,000 reported in Chicago last year. But sources describe a practice that has become widespread at the same time that top police brass have become fixated on demonstrating improvement in Chicago’s woeful crime statistics. And has there ever been improvement. Aside from homicides, which soared in 2012, the drop in crime since Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy arrived in May 2011 is unprecedented—and, some of his detractors say, unbelievable. Crime hasn’t just fallen, it has freefallen: across the city and across all major categories. Take “index crimes”: the eight violent and property crimes that virtually all U.S. cities supply to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its Uniform Crime Report. According to police figures, the number of these crimes plunged by 56 percent citywide from 2010 to 2013—an average of nearly 19 percent per year—a reduction that borders on the miraculous. To put these numbers in perspective: From 1993, when index crimes peaked, to 2010, the last full year under McCarthy’s predecessor, Jody Weis, the average annual decline was less than 4 percent. This dramatic crime reduction has been happening even as the department has been bleeding officers. (A recent Tribune analysis listed 7,078 beat cops on the streets, 10 percent fewer than in 2011.) Given these facts, the crime reduction “makes no sense,” says one veteran sergeant. “And it makes absolutely no sense that people believe it. Yet people believe it.” The city’s inspector general, Joseph Ferguson, may not. Chicago has learned that his office has questioned the accuracy of the police department’s crime statistics. A spokeswoman confirmed that the office recently finalized an audit of the police department’s 2012 crime data—though only for assault-related crimes so far—“to determine if CPD accurately classified [these categories of] crimes under its written guidelines and if it reported related crime statistics correctly.” (The audit found, among other things, that the department undercounted aggravated assaults and batteries by more than 24 percent, based on the sample cases reviewed.) Meanwhile, the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil pols on Chicago’s City Council have mostly accepted the police department’s crime numbers at face value. So have most in the media. You can hardly turn on the news without hearing McCarthy or Mayor Rahm Emanuel proclaiming unquestioned: Murders down 18 percent in 2013! Overall crime down 23 percent! Twelve thousand fewer crime victims! “These days, everything is about media and public opinion,” says one longtime officer. “If a number makes people feel safe, then why not give it to them?” If you want proof of the police department’s obsession with crime statistics, look no further than the last few days of 2012. On the night of December 27, a 40-year-old alleged gang member named Nathaniel Jackson was shot in the head and killed in Austin. The next morning, newscasters proclaimed that Chicago’s murder toll for the year had hit 500—a grim milestone last reached in 2008, during the Great Recession. By lunchtime, the police department’s spinmeisters at 35th and Michigan had challenged the reports. The actual total, they said, was 499. A murder case earlier in the year had just been reclassified as a death investigation. Critics howled. The bloggers behind Second City Cop declared: “It’s a miracle! The dead have risen!!!” By late afternoon, police had backed down; Jackson was, indeed, the 500th homicide of 2012. Chicago would end the year with 507 recorded murders, more than in any other city in the nation. Many inside the police force, as well as many outside criminologists, saw the spike in violence in 2012 as a statistical anomaly. Crime tends to go in cycles, they pointed out; the city topped 500 killings not only in 2008 but also in 2003, 2002, and 2001, to name a few. Still, it looked bad for Mayor Emanuel. His disapproval rating in the polls was rising sharply, particularly among black voters. Behind closed doors, according to a City Hall insider, Emanuel told his police chief that the department had better not allow a repeat performance of 2012 or McCarthy’s days in Chicago would be numbered. (Through a spokeswoman, the mayor declined to comment for this article.) McCarthy called 2012’s homicide total a “tragic number” and vowed that things would be different in 2013. The mindset inside police headquarters, recalls one officer: “Whatever you gotta do, this can’t happen again.” The chief felt even more pressure than his rank and file may have realized. For the former New Yorker to prove that his policing strategies worked in Chicago, he would need to keep the number of murders not just below 2012’s total but also below 2011’s: 435. To do so, McCarthy leaned even more heavily on a tool that has proved wildly successful in his hometown: CompStat. Borrowing performance-management principles from the business world, CompStat collects, analyzes, and maps a city’s crime data in real time. These statistics help police track trouble spots more accurately and pinpoint where officers are needed most. The department’s number crunchers can slice and dice the stats all sorts of ways, spitting out reports showing percentage changes in various crimes by neighborhood over different time frames, for example: month to month, week to week—heck, hour to hour. Armed with those statistics, the police brass turn up the pressure in weekly meetings, grilling field commanders about crime in their areas. The statistics are widely said to make or break a career. “The only evaluation is the numbers,” says a veteran sergeant. “God forbid your crime is up. If you have a 20 percent reduction this month, you’d better have a 21 percent reduction the next month.” The homicide numbers are especially important, says one cop: “You should see these supervisors, like cats in a room filled with rocking chairs, afraid to classify a murder because of all the screaming they will hear downtown.” If the numbers are bad, the district commanders and officers get reamed out by McCarthy and the other bosses at headquarters. These targets frequently leave the meetings seething. Even McCarthy concedes that such meetings can get ugly. “When I was a commander in New York, it was full contact,” he told Chicago in 2012. “And if you weren’t careful, you could lose an eye.” Unfortunately for all concerned, January 2013 could not have started out worse. Five people were murdered in Chicago on New Year’s Day. The number hit 17 by the end of the first full week. “This is too much,” Al Wysinger, the police department’s first deputy superintendent, told the crowd in the January 17 CompStat meeting, according to a memo summarizing it. “Last October and November, I kept saying we have to start 2013 off on the right foot. Wrong foot! We can’t reiterate this much clearer.” As the month wore on, the death toll kept rising. Among the victims were headline grabbers Ronnie Chambers, 33, the last of his mother’s four children to die from gun violence, and Hadiya Pendleton, 15, the honor student who was shot in a park about a mile from President Obama’s house. And then there was 20-something Tiffany Jones from the South Side. (To protect the identity of her family, we have given her a pseudonym.) In January, Jones got into an argument with a male relative that turned into a “serious physical fight,” according to the police report. Her sister later told police that she saw the enraged man punch Jones in the head. Police and paramedics arrived to find Jones’s siblings struggling to keep him out of the family’s apartment. Inside, Jones was sitting on the couch, gasping for breath. When officers asked her if she wanted to press battery charges, she could only nod yes, the police report shows. She tried to stand but collapsed to the floor, no longer breathing. Rushed to the hospital, Jones was soon pronounced dead. The attending doctor noted head trauma and bleeding behind Jones’s left eye. Seeing fresh bruises on her left cheek, left eye, and both arms, the investigating officers were leaning toward recommending a first-degree murder charge against the male relative, according to the police report. First-degree murder—willfully killing or committing an act that creates a “strong probability of death or great bodily harm”—carries more severe penalties than any other homicide charge. The next day, however, a pathologist with the Cook County medical examiner’s office came to the surprising conclusion that Jones had died from a blood clot that was unrelated to the fight. “Because of the embolism,” the pathologist noted to detectives, according to the police report, Jones “would have died ‘from just walking down the street.’ ” Disagreements between police and medical examiners are rare but not unheard of. When they do occur, the rule for police is clear. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook expressly states that a police department’s classification of a homicide should be based solely on a police investigation, not on the determination of a medical examiner or prosecutor’s office. But the officers did not ask for a lesser homicide charge, such as involuntary manslaughter, against Jones’s relative. Nor did they even charge him with battery. The reason, the report states: “the lack of any complaining victim or witness to the domestic battery incident.” Never mind that a dead victim cannot complain. Advertisement Police sent the man on his way. And that was that. Search for this case in the police department’s public database of 2013 crimes and you won’t find it. It’s as if it never happened. By the end of January, 44 people had been murdered in Chicago, more than in any first month since 2002. That big number—and the national attention brought by Pendleton’s killing—set off more public furor about the inability of McCarthy and Emanuel to stem the bloodshed. A spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police said that their strategies had “failed miserably.” Even aldermen who had heaped praise on McCarthy in the past started to criticize. “If this isn’t dealt with soon,” warned the 21st Ward alderman Howard Brookins, chairman of the City Council’s black caucus, “the mayor is gonna be forced to do something about McCarthy, or this could potentially become his snow issue.” It was a reference to Mayor Michael Bilandic’s mishandling of the Blizzard of ’79, one of the most infamous career killers in Chicago political history. After January 2013, the number of homicides in Chicago began falling dramatically. February ended with just 14. March ended with 17. That compares with 29 and 52, respectively, in 2012. Emanuel and McCarthy were giddy. The policing changes they had made in the past three months had worked! Those changes included, a day after Pendleton’s death, moving 200 officers from desks to the streets and bringing back the roving units Emanuel and McCarthy had disbanded when they first took over. What’s more, in February, McCarthy started sending officers into 20 “impact zones” deemed the most dangerous in the city. In March, some 400 cops began patrolling these zones daily, racking up about 1 million in overtime per week. McCarthy was frustrated that the media was giving most of the credit for the murder reduction to the cold weather rather than to his policing strategies. The city called a news conference. “We are clearly having an impact on the homicides,” Emanuel told reporters on April 1. He declared that the number of murders in the first quarter of 2013 was lower than in any other first quarter in the past 50 years. The mayor didn’t mention that the department’s own records show that Chicago had the exact same number of homicides in the first three months of 2009 as it did in the first three months of 2013. Nor did he remind his audience that Chicago’s population has shrunk by nearly 1 million people since 1960. Look at murder rates—homicides per 100,000 people—and you get 15 today. That rate is one-third higher than in 1960. And it’s nearly four times New York City’s current rate. April Fool’s Day marked the unofficial start of a new city tactic: inundate the public with crime-decline statistics, carefully choosing time periods that demonstrated the biggest possible drops from the same period in 2012 or beyond, whatever sounded best. “Between the time of 8:36 am 32 seconds and 8:39 am 15 seconds . . . crime went down an amazing 89%!!! compared to the same time last year,” one wag posted on Second City Cop. Turns out the low March homicide numbers were made possible in part by curious categorizations of two more deaths. One is the case of Maurice Harris. On March 15, the 57-year-old Harris—an older man playing a young man’s game—teamed up with a crew selling heroin near the corner of Cicero and Van Buren on the West Side. It was a sliver of turf that belonged to a street gang, the Undertaker Vice Lords. Midmorning, Harris saw about five men walking up the block. His crew scattered. Harris got a tap on the shoulder, then a punch in the face, according to the police report. Moments later, he was on the sidewalk, taking repeated punches and kicks and blows to the head with a metal pipe. When the beatdown finally ended, Harris told a witness that he couldn’t feel his legs. He was rushed to Loretto Hospital, then transferred to two other hospitals—Mount Sinai and Rush—as his condition worsened. On March 19, Harris began slurring his words, and his arms went numb. Doctors put in a breathing tube; they also diagnosed a spinal cord injury. On March 21, six days after the beating, Harris died. Police recorded the Maurice Harris case as a battery, which is indisputably true. But not as a homicide. At first, the Cook County medical examiner’s office said that an autopsy was inconclusive. The pathologist, according to the police report, “deferred the cause and manner of death pending further studies.” Eight months later, on November 13, the same pathologist made a final ruling—a head scratcher to every police source we spoke to who reviewed the case. Harris, the doctor determined, died from a pulmonary embolism, diabetes, and drug abuse. The police report summarized the pathologist’s findings: “The victim showed no significant evidence of injuries sustained from the battery [and] that in no way did it appear that the battery contributed to the cause of his death and therefore ruled his death as natural.” That’s all detectives needed to close their death investigation. But they still had to wrap up the battery case. They declared it solved, reporting that they knew what had happened, knew who beat up Harris, and had enough evidence to “support an arrest, charge, and [turn] over to the court for prosecution.” But because the victim was dead and “there is no complaining witness to aid in the prosecution,” there was no reason to move forward. Harris’s attackers were therefore never apprehended. On March 28, three weeks after Chicago filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the Cook County medical examiner’s office about the case of Maurice Harris, the office changed its death ruling from “natural” to “undetermined.” The ruling cited new information from medical records that, a spokesman for the medical examiner says, the office had requested “some time ago” but had only just received. The current chief medical examiner, Stephen Cina, was appointed by Cook County board president Toni Preckwinkle in July 2012. That was shortly after previous examiner Nancy Jones retired following an avalanche of negative publicity about bodies stacking up at the city morgue. It was also a few months after Preckwinkle and the county’s board of commissioners had passed ordinances giving themselves more power over the office—for example, imposing a five-year term limit and making it easier to fire the medical examiner by a simple majority vote. Previously, the medical examiner’s tenure could last a lifetime: a Supreme Court–like term meant to insulate the position from the political and police pressures so notorious in “Crook County.” As the former deputy medical examiner of Broward County in famously corrupt South Florida, Cina was plenty used to politics. “If I get an inordinate amount of pressure, I don’t intend to buckle or break under it,” he vowed to the Sun-Times. Cina says he has made numerous changes to the office to bring it more in line with national standards. “We’ve rewritten every standard operating procedure in the place,” he says. He also says that he has “tweaked” how his office assigns the cause and manner of a death. For example, he added the ruling “homicide by unspecified means”—the ruling that police used to shut down the Tiara Groves homicide investigation. “Some people may not be familiar with the term, but it’s an acceptable cause of death,” Cina insists. Might changes under Cina help explain the perplexing findings in other 2013 cases, such as those of Maurice Harris and Tiffany Jones? There is no evidence that the medical examiner’s office intentionally issued misleading or inaccurate rulings to help the city keep its homicide count down. “I’ve never felt pressure one way or another to make my ruling,” Cina says. “I’m pro–scientific truth more than anything.” But knowledgeable sources who reviewed these cases for Chicago say that the way the medical examiner’s rulings were worded gave police the wiggle room they needed to avoid “taking a hit” on the statistics, as one detective put it. Says a source who used to work at the medical examiner’s office: “I can see the powers that be in the police department saying, ‘Here’s our out.’ ” On March 17, two days after Maurice Harris got pummeled, police were called to the top floor of a red-brick three-flat in Pilsen. A man who had just returned home from a trip smelled a “foul odor” coming from a plastic air mattress in the bedroom of a roommate he hadn’t seen in weeks. When he started pulling debris from the mattress, he saw a grotesquely decomposed human head. The rest of the body was cocooned in garbage. Investigators opened the bag to find that the corpse was a woman’s, wrapped in a blood-soaked blanket. She was wearing turquoise jogging pants, a black camisole, a hoodie, and boots. Police identified her as Michelle Manalansan, 29, a student at Harold Washington College. She had last been seen at her downtown apartment on February 9. The police report adds that investigators were told by witnesses that the absent roommate “was the last person seen with [Michelle].” Advertisement The roommate, police learned, was wanted by the Cook County sheriff for a probation violation. They also learned that a relative had bought him a ticket to Los Angeles on a train that left Chicago six days after Manalansan disappeared. Despite the circumstances, police classified the case as a noncriminal death investigation. A detective soon made it an even lower priority: He suspended the case until the roommate could be “located and interviewed.” Manalansan’s death certificate on file with the Cook County clerk’s office says that she died by homicide—specifically, blunt head and neck trauma. But at presstime, her case had still not been classified as criminal. The roommate was still at large. With a hint of disgust, one retired veteran detective who reviewed the cases of Michelle Manalansan, Maurice Harris, Tiffany Jones, and Tiara Groves for Chicago called all four “counters.” That is, cases that he believes the police should have counted as homicides. “I’m not surprised that these cases have not come to light, based on who the victims are,” he says. “However, it is a travesty that the cases are not being investigated.” (While all cases are technically ongoing until they are closed, detectives say that death investigations are much lower priorities than homicide investigations.) As the spring of 2013 wore on, Mother Nature delivered a blessing: a deluge. That April would be the wettest on record and was relatively quiet; bad weather tends to keep criminals off the streets. Murders began ticking up again in May. And June ended with 45, only three below 2012’s total. Still, when the Chicago Police Department added up the homicides for the first half of the year, they got 184—a whopping 30 percent fewer than the year-ago period. “Fewer murders than in any year since 1965,” McCarthy told reporters. One factor, as the Tribune first noted, was that the department excluded from the count three homicides that occurred within city limits but on expressways patrolled by state police. (There would be another expressway homicide before the end of the year.) Before McCarthy’s arrival, the department did not exclude such crimes from its homicide total, according to longtime police sources. The second half of the year, of course, includes the dog days of summer, the high-crime period that really sends sweat down the backs of police leaders. And July exploded. Over the long Independence Day weekend alone, 13 people were killed and more than 70 were shot in Chicago. The ensuing days weren’t much better. “It’s mayhem,” declared one state lawmaker, Monique Davis, of the South Side. She called on Governor Pat Quinn to send the Illinois National Guard and the state police to Chicago to help keep the peace. By month’s end, the murder count had hit 53, versus 50 in July 2012. “We are not going to rest until people feel the reality of these numbers.” Mayor Rahm Emanuel at a December 15 press conference, on Chicago’s 2013 violence reduction In August—typically Chicago’s hottest month—the stress inside Chicago Police Department headquarters was palpable. That’s when several police insiders first told Chicago about what they called “the panel.” Said to be made up of a small group of very high-level officers, the panel allegedly began scrutinizing death cases in which the victims didn’t die immediately or where the circumstances that led to the deaths couldn’t be immediately determined, sources say. Panel members were looking for anything that could be delayed, keeping it off the books for a week, a month, maybe a year. “Whatever the case may be, it had to wait until it came back from the panel,” says a well-placed police insider. “All this was to hide the murder numbers, that’s all they are doing.” (How many cases did get delayed, if any, is unknown.) By the end of August the department had counted 286 homicides since January—80 fewer than in 2012. With the summer all but behind them, the police brass pretty much knew that, barring some extraordinary crime wave, the year’s homicide count would not eclipse 2012’s. But 2013’s total this far was still eight more than recorded during the same period in 2011. For McCarthy, beating the 2011 number was starting to look like an elusive goal. On September 19, two gun-toting gangbangers opened fire on a crowded pickup basketball game in Cornell Park, in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. One of them used an AK-47. When the bullets stopped flying, 13 people had been wounded, including a three-year-old boy. But no one died. A “miracle,” McCarthy said. (In the stats book, the shootings counted as only one “shooting incident” in CompStat. Read more about that in part 2 of this story.) Two days after gunfire lit up Cornell Park, an extra-alarm fire erupted in a three-story apartment building at 112th Street and King Drive, in the Roseland neighborhood. When firefighters arrived just before 2 a.m., much of the building and the stairwell was engulfed in flames. Inside, they found Millicent Brown-Johnson, 28, in a purple nightgown, her body covered in black soot, unconscious on the floor of her third-floor apartment. Her eight-year-old son, Jovan Perkins, was passed out in the stairwell, ravaged by second- and third-degree burns, according to the police report. Ambulances rushed them to the hospital. Brown-Johnson, who had been working at the American Girl Place store on Michigan Avenue as she pursued a degree in physical therapy, did not survive. Perkins, a second grader, died later that night. Firefighters and police immediately determined the fire to be suspicious. The next day they found a plastic gas container inside a garbage can in Palmer Park, across the street from the charred building. On September 28, the medical examiner’s office ruled that both mother and son had died of smoke inhalation and that, based on the police and fire department investigations, their deaths were homicides. However, the case was classified as a death investigation, not a murder investigation, and the police did not include the two deaths in their year-end homicide count. Nor have police caught the arsonist. “How will I ever get justice if the case is not even categorized the right way?” asks Austin Perkins, the boy’s father, a truck driver from Hammond, Indiana. Excluding Brown-Johnson and Perkins from Chicago’s homicide statistics helped the September numbers clock in at 42 rather than 44. At this point, the 2011 numbers were actually beginning to look beatable. Through the first nine months of 2013, the department’s murder tally was 322, versus 317 for the same period two years before. ||||| The City of Chicago touted a drop in the crime rate last year but the way these numbers were reported does not paint a full picture. The City of Chicago’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit on the Chicago Police Department’s crime statistics reporting. The audit focused on a sample of the classifications and reporting of assault crimes in 2012. According to the audit, the Inspector General’s office found that the department incorrectly classified 3.1 percent of its assault-related events. In response, the Chicago Police Department agreed with the audit findings and will be reviewing all aggravated assaults and batteries from 2012 and 2013. However, Chicago magazine published part one of a two-part series Monday titled “The Truth About Chicago’s Crime Rate,” in which reporters David Bernstein and Noah Isackson detail a number of incidents in which crimes were reclassified in order to fit the narrative that crime overall was falling in the city. “There was a sense that it was too good to be true,” Bernstein said. “You would hear Superintendent McCarthy and Mayor Emanuel talk about these massive crime drops but people in the neighborhoods didn’t see this and the cops in those areas didn’t see it.” The article details the ways in which statistics are compiled by the police force and changes in protocol that have been made in the past few years. We chat with David Bernstein about the Chicago magazine story and how the Chicago Police Department is reviewing past reporting statistics.

In addition, CPD’s CompStat reports and the City’s Data Portal accurately reflected the assault-related incidents in CPD’s data warehouse, the Criminal History Record Information System. OIG also identified significant errors in CPD’s reports to the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (I-UCR) program, which feeds into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system: Contrary to I-UCR reporting requirements, CPD failed to count each victim in multiple victim crimes as a separate offense. This resulted in a 24% undercount in victim offenses in the reporting sample OIG examined. CPD erroneously excluded certain crimes committed against protected persons, thereby underreporting all aggravated assaults and batteries to the I-UCR program by 5.7% and 3.2% respectively. CPD agreed with OIG’s findings and is reviewing all aggravated assaults and batteries from 2012 and 2013 to ensure the accuracy of its reports to I-UCR. CPD will also provide clearer guidance on multi-victim crime reporting in its Field Reporting Manual and, if needed, will add categories to its classification rules in order to better address I-UCR reporting needs for incidents involving protected persons. |||||","completion":"Chicago has seen a noticeable drop in crime in recent years, with the number of \\"index crimes\\" reported across the city declining by 56% from 2010 to 2013. This drop has been attributed to the implementation of CompStat, a tool that collects, analyzes, and maps crime data in real time, helping the police department identify troubled areas and allocate resources more efficiently. However, there have been concerns that the crime statistics reported by the Chicago Police Department are not entirely accurate, with suggestions that some crimes, including homicides, have been misclassified or downgraded. A report by Chicago magazine in 2014 found that some homicide cases were reclassified as death investigations or noncriminal incidents for unclear or illogical reasons. The same report identified several other serious felony cases, such as robberies and assaults, that were also misclassified or downgraded. Though this practice may represent only a small percentage of reported crimes, it raises questions about the integrity of the reported statistics. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that even if some crime numbers have been manipulated, there have been genuine efforts to improve crime-fighting strategies in Chicago. The use of CompStat and the adoption of policing tactics from other cities, such as New York and Los Angeles, have contributed to an overall decline in crime. As crime rates continue to fall, it remains essential for law enforcement agencies and the public to assess their efficacy and address any discrepancies in reported statistics to ensure public safety and maintain trust in the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort their grandfather. One grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent. He was there for about fifteen minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch and happily gave it to Joe. Joe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it.

Eating sustainably means eating foods that support both your own good health and the sustainability of the environment. If you’re eating seafood, make sure that it’s not at risk of being overfished, or farmed in a way that’s damaging the environment. Try to buy from local growers whenever possible. Local farmers are usually invested in employing sustainable farm practices. Read the labels on your food products. If you don’t recognize more than ⅓ of the words found there, look for something less processed. This means eat less beef, which is higher on the food chain, and more roots, vegetables, and fruits. Smaller fish, such as anchovies, are usually better to eat than larger fish, such as tuna, which are higher up the food chain and typically higher in mercury. Plant-based foods require still less energy to produce. Shifting to a more plant-based style of eating will slow the deforestation that domestic meat production requires. Healthy diet guidelines encourage at least 50% of your daily diet consist of fruits and vegetables. If you do eat meat, treat it as a condiment rather than a main dish. Be aware that factory-farmed meat is produced in ways that contribute to greenhouse gases and environmental degradation. Learn to hunt deer for a more natural meat source. You’ll avoid the energy required to transport products from far away. In addition, getting to know your local food producers will help you understand how your food was grown and harvested. Most fresh fish must be transported by air, if it’s not local. Even out-of-season frozen fish will be more sustainable than fresh fish flown in. As the nutritional value of food diminishes with time, eating locally grown food increases the amount of nutrition you’ll receive. Many international food growers use unregulated or under-regulated environmental practices. American grown products, while not always perfect, are usually farmed with more sustainable practices. Take the time to research products you purchase regularly. Good retailers will be well-informed on the way their sellers practice sustainability. Knowing more about your farmers and food sources through your retailers can help support local business, which are invested in protecting and preserving the environment.","completion":"Eating sustainably involves consuming foods that promote personal health and environmental sustainability, including local, less-processed options, plant-based meals, and responsibly-sourced seafood, while minimizing high-impact meats and supporting local food producers."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","completion":"Due to Jeff's taller stature as a result of his growth spurt during puberty, he would likely have an advantage in playing basketball over soccer. Basketball typically favors taller players as they have a greater ability to reach for rebounds, block shots, and achieve a higher shooting angle, which can lead to a higher shooting percentage. While height can also be helpful in soccer, especially for heading the ball or playing specific positions like a goalkeeper, soccer tends to rely more on agility, speed, and technical skills, which are not solely determined by height. Therefore, Jeff's size would likely provide him with a greater advantage when playing basketball compared to soccer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: shoreline, coast, coastal area, lake, manhattan Why is \\"shoreline\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Shoreline\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the boundary between a body of water, such as a bay, and the landmass that surrounds it. A bay is a body of water partially enclosed by land, usually with a wide opening to the sea or another larger body of water. The shoreline is the part of the land that comes into direct contact with the water, forming the natural barrier between the bay and its surrounding area. Of the possible answers provided, \\"shoreline\\" is the most accurate and specific term describing the physical boundary between a bay and the adjacent land. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are not as aligned with human common sense as \\"shoreline\\": 1. \\"Coast\\" refers to a more extensive land area than a shoreline and includes areas beyond the immediate boundary of a bay. It is often thought of as the larger area where the land meets the sea in general, rather than being specific to the border of a bay. 2. \\"Coastal area\\" is a vague term and can cover a widely varying range of geographies, such as cliffs, beaches, or dunes. It doesn't specifically refer to the boundary between a bay and the land as a shoreline does. 3. \\"Lake\\" is a completely different type of water body, which is a natural or artificial body of water largely surrounded by land and not connected to a larger water body like the sea. It would not be appropriate to describe the separation between a bay and the water. 4. \\"Manhattan\\" is a borough in New York City and entirely unrelated to the concept of a geographical boundary between a bay and the land. Thus, \\"shoreline\\" is the answer most closely aligned with human common sense because it accurately describes the natural barrier between a bay and its surrounding land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Sixth Sense Context: Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

Colonel Lahmadi Bouguern told the APS state news agency that 99 passengers and four crew were on board the C-130 Hercules transport plane, which took off from the southern Tamanrasset province and was bound for Constantine. The Defence Ministry said 77 people were killed and said the crash was likely due to bad weather. Initial reports in Algerian media had put the death toll at 103. \\"The plane crashed into a mountain and exploded. Several bodies were burnt to ashes and could not be identified,\\" one official told Reuters by telephone from the area. State television said President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had declared three days of mourning from Wednesday.

(Associated Press) Air traffic controllers lost radio and radar contact with the U.S.-built C-130 Hercules turboprop just before noon and dispatched helicopters to try to find it. The plane was discovered in pieces on Mount Fortas near the town of Ain Kercha, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Constantine, the main city in eastern Algeria. The plane was heading to Constantine from the southern Saharan city of Tamanrasset, which has a massive military presence due to its proximity to the country's unstable southern borders. It was at least 24 years old, according to sales information supplied by its maker, Lockheed Martin Corp. The plane carried 74 passengers and four crew members, the military said in its statement, blaming poor weather for the crash. Earlier in the day, Algerian government officials and Algerian state media had reported that the plane had 99 passengers, making for a much higher death toll. The lone survivor — a soldier — suffered head injuries and was treated at a nearby military facility before being flown to the military hospital in Algiers, a retired Algerian intelligence officer told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Civil defense officials at the snowy crash site said the plane broke into three parts and women and children were among the dead. Military transports in Algeria routinely carry not only soldiers but military families and sometimes even other civilians, if space is available. Commander Farid Nechad, who was coordinating recovery efforts, told the AP that 55 bodies had been recovered so far but conditions at the crash site were difficult. \\"Unfavorable weather conditions and storms accompanied by snow in the region were behind the crash,\\" the defense ministry said. The presidency announced a three-day period of mourning, calling the soldiers who had died \\"martyrs for the country.\\" Lockheed Martin's hulking C-130 Hercules transport, born out of the experiences of the 1950-53 Korean War, has been used by air forces all over the world to help fight wars or save lives in humanitarian situations. Lockheed Martin confirmed that it sold C-130s to Algeria from 1981 to 1990 and said if Algerian authorities asked, the company would work with them to investigate Tuesday's crash. It did not release specific information on the age of the plane. In other crashes involving similar planes, six people died in November 2012 when an Algerian Air Force C-130 crashed into a hillside in France, according to the Aviation Safety Network's database. In 2003, 10 people died when an Algerian Air Force C-130 crashed after an engine caught fire shortly after it took off from an air base near Boufarik, Algeria, according to the database. The worst plane crash in Algerian history occurred in 2003, when 102 people were killed after a civilian airliner crashed at the end of the runway in Tamanrasset. There was also a single survivor in that crash. Sole survivors of large plane crashes are extremely rare, said Ky Dickens of Chicago, director and co-producer of a documentary on such survivors. Dickens, who began research for her film in 2010, identified 15 sole survivors around the world. She limited her search to commercial planes carrying more than 40 people. Many sole survivors are either children or a member of the flight crew — a flight attendant or pilot, Dickens said. ___ Schemm reported from Rabat.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

Members on the public audit committee questioned Auditor General Caroline Gardner about policing budgets. She said updated projections suggested Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority would run a cumulative deficit of almost £200m by 2021. SNP MSP Alex Neil called this \\"totally unacceptable\\" and a sign of \\"an organisation in crisis\\" over finance. Audit Scotland issued a highly critical report of Scotland's policing finances for the third year running in December. Ms Gardner told MSPs that \\"the lack of progress that's been made in demonstrating financial leadership is unacceptable for any public body, but particularly for one of the scale and importance of policing in Scotland\\", adding that there was \\"scope for more transparency\\" in how the £1.1bn policing budget is spent.

I consider this projection to be conservative.\\" Mr Neil suggested bringing the chief constable and other heads of the police service before the committee to give evidence. He said: \\"This is a totally unacceptable performance. There's a general lack of confidence in policing in Scotland at the moment. \\"We know that morale is rock bottom amongst the police force, I know that the chief constable believes he's £60m short of the money that he actually needs to do the job he's been asked to do, so we have to give them their say to see if this is all part and parcel of the same problem. \\"But it strikes me that this is an organisation in crisis, in terms of the management of their finances.\\" Fellow committee member Colin Beattie said the latest report was \\"deeply disappointing\\", while Labour's Monica Lennon questioned how the public could have confidence in the force over financial management. And convener Jenny Marra said the evidence was \\"incredibly worrying\\", saying the committee would be inviting police chiefs to give evidence. Police bosses have insisted progress has been made, with an initial long-term financial strategy drawn up in March 2016. A spokesman for the Scottish Police Authority said bosses \\"look forward to providing parliament with further assurance\\" on the \\"major refresh and strengthening\\" of leadership. He said: \\"While we have acknowledged issues around policing's financial performance, the operational performance of the service remains strong. \\"We are not complacent about that because we know that the demands on policing are changing, with an increasing emphasis on vulnerability, private space crimes, and online threats.

Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments.

Answer based on context: In 1965 Maynard was teamed with rookie quarterback Joe Namath. Maynard had 1,218 yards on 68 receptions and 14 touchdowns in Namaths first season (Namath had 22 touchdown passes that year). In 1967, Maynard caught 1,434 of Namaths historic 4,007 passing yards. The receiving yards were a career-high for Maynard and led the league; he also had 71 receptions, 10 touchdowns, and averaged 20.2 yards per catch. In the 1968 season opener against 1968 Kansas City Chiefs season, Maynard had 200+ receiving yards for the first time in his career and passed Tommy McDonald (American football) as the active leader in receiving yards, where he remained for the next six seasons until his retirement. He added a career-best 228 yards in Game 10 against 1968 Oakland Raiders season. Maynard had 57 receptions for 1,297 yards (22.8 yards per catch) and 10 of Namaths 15 touchdowns that year. In the 1968 AFL Championship Game, a 27-23 Jets victory over the Oakland Raiders, Maynard caught six passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. His 14-yard catch in the first quarter gave the Jets the lead and his six-yard catch in the fourth quarter proved to be the game winner. The Jets would go on to win Super Bowl III, 16-7 over the NFLs Baltimore Colts, which was hailed as the first \\"upset\\" in Super Bowl history. Maynard played, but had no catches while suffering the effects of a hamstring injury in the AFL title game. How many years after Maynard was teamed up the Joe Namath did Maynard catch 1434 of Namaths historic 4007 passing yards?","completion":"Maynard was teamed up with Joe Namath in 1965. He caught 1,434 of Namath's historic 4,007 passing yards in 1967. Therefore, it took Maynard 2 years after being teamed up with Namath to catch 1,434 of his passing yards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda, from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones in the front of the upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon.

What is the answer: October 26th, 1881, was the famous shootout at the OK Corral. In what Arizona town was it located?","completion":"The famous shootout at the OK Corral took place on October 26th, 1881, in the town of Tombstone, located in southeastern Arizona. Tombstone was founded in 1879 by prospector Ed Schieffelin and soon became an important mining town with the discovery of rich silver deposits in the area. As the town's population grew and attracted a diverse mix of miners, merchants, cattlemen, and outlaws, tensions and conflicts were inevitable. The famous shootout was a result of escalating tensions between two factions: the lawmen led by town Marshal and deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, along with his brothers, assistant town Marshal Morgan Earp and temporary special policeman Wyatt Earp, and their friend, dentist-turned-gambler and part-time lawman Doc Holliday; and a group of outlaw cowboys, including Ike and Billy Clanton, Tom and Frank McLaury, and Billy Claiborne. The situation that led to the shootout was a combination of personal disagreements, political tensions, and criminal activities. The Earps held a strong belief in upholding law and order, while the Clantons and McLaurys were allegedly involved in cattle rustling and other illegal activities. These differences, coupled with personal grudges, fueled the animosity between the two groups. On the morning of October 26th, 1881, Ike Clanton got into a heated argument with Doc Holliday and the Earps, resulting in Clanton being fined and disarmed by Virgil Earp for violating the city's ordinance against carrying firearms within city limits. Later that day, the armed cowboys, in defiance of the law and the Earps, congregated near the OK Corral, a small livery stable and corral located on the outskirts of Tombstone. As the lawmen approached the cowboys to disarm them, a confrontation ensued and turned into a deadly 30-second shootout, leaving Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury, and Frank McLaury dead, and Virgil and Morgan Earp injured. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday remained unharmed. The incident brought nationwide attention and has since been immortalized in books, plays, and movies, ultimately making the names Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday synonymous with the Wild West. In the aftermath of the shootout, several trials and investigations took place, and the event's impact only served to further divide the people of Tombstone. The dramatic gunfight at the OK Corral has come to symbolize a time and place in American history when the lawless frontier began to give way to a more civilized society as it struggled to maintain order against the backdrop of the rugged and untamed landscape."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.zxing.client.android.

The app has a simple and user-friendly interface, which made it easy for me to scan various barcodes right off the bat.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Violent winds swept the ocean, and waves thundered to shore, shaking the lookout tower at Pea Island Rescue Station. Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Noting the dangerous surf and wind conditions, Captain Etheridge quickly decided the surf boats would be impossible to control. Instead, he decided to use another way to help the survivors. The crew set off on the long journey down the beach to the scene of the wreck . Captain Etheridge hoped to fire a line from a gun to the ship's mast . After the ship's crew dragged the line onboard, the surfmen would fire a second line and carry survivors safely to shore. The surfmen crossed three miles of sand to reach the ship Newman. The water was freezing, and the... Question: The beach patrols were canceled because _ .

President Barack Obama, in a chilling assessment of international efforts to stem a deadly Ebola outbreak, said the world has not done enough to respond to a health crisis that poses a growing threat to regional and global security. 'There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be,' Obama said Thursday in remarks to a high-level United Nations meeting on Ebola. The U.S. president asserted that 'if we move fast, even if imperfectly, then that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.' While Obama touted the progress the","completion":"international community has made in combating the Ebola outbreak, he emphasized that there is still much work to be done. \\"We have seen some encouraging signs – increased funding, the establishment of treatment centers, and the deployment of healthcare professionals.

The 44th president highlighted several key actions that the international community must take to close the gap in the global response to Ebola. \\"First, we need to continue ramping up our commitments and mobilizing resources to support the affected countries in their fight against this virus.

Translate the following sentence to French: NATIONAL TARGETS Migrants and ethnic minorities disabled Other groups or targets","completion":"To translate the requested phrase from English to French, it would be helpful to understand the context. For instance, is it a header for a table or a section, or a sentence in a document? Due to the lack of contextual details, I'll proceed with the most standard interpretations. Here's the requested translation: \\"OBJECTIFS NATIONAUX Migrants et minorités ethniques handicapés Autres groupes ou objectifs\\" Here's a step by step explanation of a translation process: 1. NATIONAL TARGETS - \\"Objectifs Nationaux\\": National targets usually refer to the goals or aims set by a country. The French equivalent of 'national' is 'nationaux' (considering 'targets' as masculine), and 'targets' can be roughly translated to 'objectifs', which refers to goals or aims. 2. Migrants and ethnic minorities - \\"Migrants et minorités ethniques\\": 'Migrants' remains the same in both languages. 'Ethnic minorities' translates to 'minorités ethniques'. 3. Disabled - \\"Handicapés\\": This term translates directly to 'handicapés'. 4. Other groups or targets - \\"Autres groupes ou objectifs\\": 'Other' translates to 'autres', 'groups' to 'groupes', 'or' to 'ou', and 'targets' to 'objectifs' again. While there's no direct one-for-one translation in many cases due to the nuances and context of each language, this is a fairly standard and direct translation, attempting to maintain fidelity to the source's meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a step in the conservatory, and before she could turn round, her brother Maurice bent over her, and kissed her. 'Maurice! you have come after all!' 'Yes, the school inspection is put off.

Gallstones, inflammation, and other issues can affect the gallbladder, leading to discomfort and impaired function. If you wish to maintain a healthy gallbladder and alleviate pain associated with gallstones or other issues, consider incorporating these natural remedies into your daily routine. 1. Herbal Tea: A Soothing and Beneficial Beverage Drinking 2 to 4 cups of herbal tea a day provides numerous benefits for gallbladder health. Herbal teas, such as dandelion, milk thistle, and peppermint, have been known to stimulate bile production and encourage optimal gallbladder function. By integrating these teas into your daily routine, you can help maintain a healthy digestive system and reduce the risk of developing gallstones. 2. Castor Oil Pack: A Warm and Relaxing Solution for Swelling Applying a castor oil pack with a heating pad can aid in reducing swelling and alleviate discomfort associated with an inflamed gallbladder. Castor oil has anti-inflammatory properties, while heat helps relax muscles and improve blood circulation. To perform this remedy, soak a piece of clean cloth in cold-pressed castor oil. Place the cloth over the affected area and cover it with a heating pad set on a low to medium temperature for 45 minutes to an hour. Repeat this process two to three times a week for optimal results. 3. Phosphatidylcholine: A Supplement that Helps Dissolve Gallstones Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a natural supplement that can help break down gallstones and improve overall gallbladder health. PC is a major component of lecithin, which is found in egg yolks, soybeans, and sunflower seeds. By supplementing with PC 1 to 2 times per day, the body's bile composition can be improved, which helps dissolve gallstones and prevent their formation. Consult your healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen, especially if you have any preexisting health conditions or are taking medications. 4. Acupuncture: An Ancient Technique to Support Gallbladder Function Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. This practice can help relieve pain and stimulate proper gallbladder function by balancing the body's energy flow. While acupuncture may not be suitable for everyone, it is worth considering as a natural approach to gallbladder health, especially for those who are seeking a non-invasive, holistic remedy. Consult a licensed and experienced acupuncture practitioner to discuss your symptoms and receive personalized treatment. Conclusion: Maintaining gallbladder health is crucial for proper digestion and overall well-being. By incorporating natural remedies, such as drinking herbal tea, using a castor oil pack, taking phosphatidylcholine supplements, and trying acupuncture, you can address gallbladder issues and promote a healthier, pain-free lifestyle. Take control of your gallbladder health and improve its function with these effective and time-tested remedies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football.

Q: Text: so, this happened yesterday. i went out to get my hair cut at a local chain store that i go to on a biweekly basis. i don't usually request a specific stylist, so i log into the system and take my seat until i'm called by a girl that i've never seen before. i find out this is actually her 2nd day here. i pop a squat in the barber chair and we start to exchange pleasantries. she's quite cute and we are actually hitting it off very well (i know, it's her job to be pleasant). we talk about common interests an christmas shopping comes up and she mentions how she needed to this job to afford gifts for her family. so she finishes my cut and we go back for her to wash my hair. this is by far my favorite part of the whole experience. getting your hair washed by a cute girl is probably the closest i ever come to feeling like those guys in the movies who have beautiful women feed them grapes. (idk, the analogy fits in my mind). this girl goes all out. perfect water temperature, massages my scalp and my neck! i'm sitting here feeling absolutely amazing! she finishes up, puts some product in my hair and i'm feeling really good about how i look and feel. this girl definitely earned her tip. we walk over to the register and i swipe my card and await the prompt on the screen to add the tip. my total comes to 16.20. 5.00 tip is more than fair, especially since she went all out with the head massage. i punch in my tip amount and immediately hit the confirm button. as i wait for my recept, i watch the girls eyes get huge and she looks at me in excitiment. she run from behind the counter and hugs me! i'm flabbergasted! she starts getting teary eyes and stumbles over herself to say \\"thank you\\" over and over. i'm thinkin, man, it's just 5 bucks, but i won't say no to a hug from a cute random girl. she hands me my recept and i start to make my way to the door when i realize what had happened. when i punched in the 5.00, i accidentally hit the 0 an extra time... i tipped her 50.00 instead of 5.00. shit. at this point i need to make a decision. do i wreck this girls day by admitting i made a mistake, or do i just eat the 66.00 hair cut? i turn around and take another look at her. she's still so excited, looking close to tears. she's probably thinking she's so lucky that this guy just came in, sat in her chair, and just helped her make her christmas a little bit better out of the kindness of his heart. i look at my recept again and sigh to myself. \\"merry christmas!\\" i turn and leave, leaving a little bit of christmas spirit and a nice chunk of my bank account. edit: i'm male, stylist was female. edit2: holy crap my inbox... so to clear up a few things. i've always gotten my hair washed after the cut. this helps wash away the hair clippings so you're not itching all day. i do my hair stylists a favor by washing my hair before each cut. no i didn't shit on her chair. i go to a hair cuttery. i like it there. people are nice and a cut is 20. 16.20 with military discount. i find it insane that people drop 50-100 every time they get a hair cut, but that's just me :) as said above, i'm in the military, so i get my hair cut every two weeks. thanks for all the kind words and encouragement to attempt to go on a date with this hair dresser... if i can muster up the courage, i might, but i don't know if i want to rock the boat at a place i enjoy getting my hair cut. also, i'm less than 8 months from moving, not sure if nows the time to start a relationship. i'm really glad some people can get a nice story from this, and if i changed a few lives because of it, that's all the gratuity i need. i just want the world i live in to be a bit better. the 50 would have gone to buying fallout, but i'll be just fine picking it up after the new year. merry christmas ya'll one more edit i promise. thank you all who are offering to purchase fallout for me, i really do appreciate the offer, but there are plenty of other people who would really benefit from your generosity more so than me. you guys are awesome!

Question: suppose nutrients are destroyed happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If nutrients in the food are destroyed, it has the potential to affect the digestion process and may lead to reduced absorption of essential nutrients. The subsequent steps in the digestion process can experience varying levels of impact, depending on what is causing the destruction of nutrients and the specific nutrients involved. In this scenario, we will consider the potential consequences on the given steps of digestion. 1. An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates: If nutrients are destroyed, there may be a decrease in the breakdown of carbohydrates. The enzymes in saliva, such as amylase, may have reduced effectiveness if they do not have sufficient substrates to work on due to degraded nutrients. 2. Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow: There would be no significant effect on this process since the mechanical action of swallowing remains the same irrespective of the nutrient content of the food. 3. Acid and enzymes in the stomach break food down further: If nutrients are destroyed, more food may need to be consumed to meet the body's nutritional requirements. With more food in the stomach, there might be an increase in gastric acid and enzymes produced to break down larger amounts of food. 4. Releases nutrients: Since nutrients are destroyed, the process of releasing these nutrients would become less effective. The body would need to adjust to this change and may compensate by focusing more on undamaged nutrients or stimulating appetite to increase nutrient intake. 5. Food then pumped into the small intestine: Due to the presence of fewer nutrients, the food being pumped into the small intestine might be less substantial, leading to a decreased transit time and incomplete absorption of the remaining nutrients. 6. Fluid and enzymes from the liver and pancreas pumped into the small intestine: The liver and pancreas may need to produce more enzymes and fluids to break down the increased volume of food consumed to compensate for the destroyed nutrients. This could lead to an increased workload on the digestive system. 7. Help break food into the smallest molecules: The destroyed nutrients would have less or no effect on this process since the remaining functional enzymes would continue to facilitate the breakdown of food. 8. Nutrients pass through the wall of the small intestine: The absorption of destroyed nutrients would be significantly affected, leading to fewer nutrients being available for absorption into the bloodstream. 9. Nutrients absorbed into the bloodstream: The absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream might be reduced due to fewer available nutrients for absorption. 10. Unused materials passed into the large intestine to become fecal matter: The unused materials, including destroyed nutrients, would be passed into the large intestine and converted to fecal matter. This process might not change significantly. In summary, if nutrients are destroyed, the overall process of digestion could experience substantial perturbation by breaking down larger amounts of food to compensate for lost nutrients. This could lead to increased workload on the digestive system, decreased effectiveness of nutrient release, lesser absorption of nutrients, and the need for the body to adapt through other mechanisms to address nutrient deficiencies."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

La operación se ha realizado al sur de Francia, en la localidad de Gerde. La ministra francesa de Interior, Michèle Alliot-Marie, fue la encargada de informar sobre estas detenciones. Además de Iriondo, también han sido detenidos Eneko Zarrabeitia, alias \\"Sorgin\\", y Aitor Artetxe. Al parecer, el arresto se produjo cuando los tres acudían a una cita en una iglesia de la localidad francesa. Estaban armados y llevaban documentación falsa. La detención de Aitzol Iriondo es considerada clave ya que el etarra escaló un puesto en la banda tras la detención de Txeroki, convirtiéndose en el nuevo jefe militar de ETA. Se trataba, por ello, de uno de los etarras más buscados tras huir a Francia en octubre de 2002, con la desarticulación del \\"talde\\" denominado \\"K-Zelatun\\" de apoyo al \\"comando Donosti\\". Aitzol Iriondo se había convertido en el principal pistolero de ETA y el brazo ejecutor de dos de los atentados de la banda terrorista en el último año: el doble crimen de los guardias civiles Fernando Trapero y Raúl Centeno (el 1 de diciembre de 2007 en Capbreton, Francia), y el asesinato del ex concejal socialista Isaías Carrasco (el 7 de marzo de este año en Mondragón, Guipúzcoa). Al parecer, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, alias 'Gurbita', 'Barbas' y 'Asier', de 31 años, perpetró los tres asesinatos usando pistolas 'limpias', es decir, que no habían sido utilizadas en ningún atentado anterior. En su historial se le relaciona con otros atentados mortales. En concreto, como integrante del 'Comando Donosti', con el del jefe de la Policía Municipal de Andoain, Joseba Pagazaurtundua, asesinado en febrero de 2003. Fue detenido por primera vez en 1994 por actos de kale borroka. Estas detenciones se producen cinco días después del último atentado mortal de ETA, que asesinó el pasado miércoles al empresario vasco Ignacio Uria Mendizabal en la localidad Azpeitia (Guipúzcoa). Sobre Eneko Zarrabeitia y Aitor Artetxe, el ministro de Interior español, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, informó que el primero perteneció al \\"comando Cantabria\\" de ETA que no llegó a atentar, y el segundo es un huido del \\"comando Vizcaya\\". «Aitzol Iriondo, nuevo jefe militar de ETA según fuentes policiales» — Wikinoticias, 19 de noviembre de 2008.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion? , can you please find it? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... Answer:","completion":"The title of the song whose central riff is in NWOBHM fashion is \\"Phantom Lord.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Terrible cabbies...OPT: + negative + positive I think the answer is","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as negative for several reasons: 1. The reviewer starts by calling the cab company \\"completely unprofessional,\\" which demonstrates dissatisfaction with the service they received due to the perceived lack of professionalism. 2. The reviewer is upset that the driver passed their destination while expecting them to tell him when to stop, even though they provided the exact address. This highlights a lack of communication and efficiency on the part of the driver, which further supports the negative sentiment expressed in the review. 3. The reviewer complains that the driver did not turn off the meter when returning to their correct destination, suggesting that the driver may have been attempting to overcharge them. This is another instance of dissatisfaction and criticism directed at the company. 4. Lastly, the reviewer expresses frustration with the cabbie taking an excessive amount of time to return their change, implying that the driver was hoping they would give up and leave without it. This demonstrates distrust and adds to the overall negative sentiment of the review. Overall, this review exhibits a negative sentiment due to the various issues and instances of frustration the reviewer encountered with the cab service. There is no evidence of positive sentiment in the review, as all the experiences described are unfavorable and critical of the cab company and its driver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where is an active solider likely to sleep? Possible A: armored car, white house, underwater, tent, trenches Why is \\"tent\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Tent\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because tents are a common temporary and portable shelter used by active soldiers in various scenarios. In military terms, tents are often utilized as sleeping quarters during training exercises or deployments in the field. Tents can be easily set up, broken down, and transported, which makes them a practical and efficient solution for soldiers who need a place to sleep in between assignments or during combat. To understand better why the other answers are not aligned with human common sense, let's analyze them one by one: 1. Armored car: While armored cars are used by military personnel for transportation and protection, they are not primarily meant for sleeping purposes. It would be uncomfortable and impractical for a soldier to sleep in an armored car unless it was an emergency situation. 2. White House: The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, not a place where active soldiers typically sleep. Although the White House is protected by military personnel, it is unlikely that an active soldier would be sleeping there. 3. Underwater: Sleeping underwater is an implausible scenario for an active soldier, as humans cannot breathe or sleep underwater without specialized equipment. Moreover, underwater sleeping arrangements are not typically used in military operations as traditional shelters (like tents) are more practical. 4. Trenches: While trenches have historically been used as a form of shelter and protection during battle, they are not ideal for sleeping. Trenches can be wet, cold, and dirty, making them uncomfortable places to sleep. Additionally, trenches are not commonly used in modern warfare as technology and strategies have evolved. In conclusion, the answer \\"tent\\" is aligned with human common sense because tents provide a practical, portable, and efficient shelter solution commonly used by active soldiers in various military scenarios. The other options listed are either not intended for sleeping or not typically associated with modern military operations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. \\"not guilty\\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \\"not proven\\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There... - An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small guerrilla band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Charles Swan ( died 1690 ) was a reluctant buccaneer . Captain Swan was forced into piracy by his crew in the 1680s , and proceeded to write letters to the owners of his ship Cygnet in London , begging them to intercede with James II of England for his pardon - even as he looted his way up and down the coast of South America . He was present at the attack on Payta in 1684 , where he petulantly burned the town after no booty was found . On 25 August 1685 , he separated from his confederates Peter Harris and Edward Davis , and sailed up the coast of Mexico , but met with little success . He seized the town of Santa Pecaque but lost fifty men to a Spanish counter-attack , including Basil Ringrose . On 31 March 1686 he set out across the Pacific to ambush the Manila treasure galleon , but failed to over-take the ship . Due to the failure of the assault on Santa Pecaque provisions were short , and by the time they reached the East Indies the crew were plotting to eat their officers of the Cygnet as it crossed the Pacific ( starting with the Captain ) . ( Swan is reported to have remarked that the lean William Dampier would have made them a poor meal ; the captain himself was a remarkably fat man . ) Fortunately they arrived at Guam without resorting to cannibalism , and made their way on to the Sultanate of Mindanao . The arrogance of Swan and unruliness of his men soon spoiled their good relations with the local ruler , Raja Laut ; and when the captain decided to abandon the attempt on the galleon , his men mutinied . He managed to save five thousand pounds ( legally the property of the Cygnet 's owners ) from the mutineers , and remained in Mindanao , becoming an officer in Laut 's army ; but in 1690 he attempted to escape back to England on a Dutch ship with the money , and was chased by Laut 's warriors , who capsized his boat and speared him in the water . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Buccaneers were pirates of the Caribbean Sea who challenged Spanish hegemony on the region by attacking ships and sacking coastal settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Before long, they became a threat to non-Spanish settlements as well, and the target of anti-piracy crusades. Today the idea of a buccaneer plays a role similar to \\"pirate\\". Original buccaneer crews, however, were larger, localized to the Caribbean region, and more apt to attack well-defended ports than pirates who sailed to the Indian Ocean on the Pirate Round of the late 17th century. - James II and VII (14 October 1633 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. - A pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if never convicted. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - The Sea Peoples were a purported seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt prior to the Late Bronze Age collapse. Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max Müller: \\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\". - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship- or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pirate Round was a sailing route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates, mainly during the late 17th century. The course led from the western Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, stopping at Madagascar, then on to targets such as the coast of Yemen and India. The Pirate Round was briefly used again during the early 1720s. Pirates who followed the route are sometimes referred to as Roundsmen. The Pirate Round was largely co-extensive with the routes of the East India Company ships, of Britain and other nations. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors. - Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. It is also known, in French, as guerre de course (literally, \\"war of the chase\\") and, in German, Handelskrieg (\\"trade war\\"), from the nations most heavily committed to it historically as a strategy. - Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word \\"rob\\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. \\"deraubare\\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \\"raub\\" -- \\"theft\\". - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest.

Context: Pre-sectarian Buddhism is the earliest phase of Buddhism, recognized by nearly all scholars. Its main scriptures are the Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel or Vrangel (\\"Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Vrangel\\" April 25, 1928) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled White émigrés. - Alexander Pavlovich Rodzyanko ( Russian : ; 18 August 1879 -- 6 May 1970 ) was a lieutenant - general and a corps commander of the White Army during the Russian Civil War . - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Crimean Peninsula (\\"Krymskiy poluostrov;\\" , \\"Kryms'ky pivostriv\\"), also known simply as Crimea ( \\"Krym\\" \\"Krym\\"), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. - The Green armies, Green Army (Russian: \\" \\"), or Greens (Russian: \\"\\") were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War of 191722. They fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. At times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (by far the largest grouping of the Russian Constituent Assembly elected in 1917), the Green Armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, the Green Armies' primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War. Its strength during the civil war has been measured at 40,000 men. 'alexander rodzyanko' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

It was an alliance between Country Club Episcopalians and twice born followers of the Old Time Gospel, all firmly opposed to mass Catholic immigration from Europe. The nativism of the GOP drove Catholics into the welcoming arms of Al Smith, Jack Kennedy, Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Party. But this year's GOP front-runners are a Mormon and two Catholics -- Rick Santorum (a cradle of Italian descent) and Newt Gingrich (a convert). Roughly one-quarter of Republican primary voters are Catholic. Notable Catholic GOP leaders include John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Christine O'Donnell, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Six out of nine justices of the Supreme Court are Catholics, and five of them are Republicans. That certainly made the","completion":"shift in the Republican Party landscape apparent, beginning to reflect a more diverse range of beliefs and backgrounds among its members. This transformation can be attributed to various factors such as evolving demographics, changing social dynamics, and the gradual dismantling of the traditional conservative ideology that once dominated American politics. In recent years, the party has shown a greater inclination towards embracing individuals from different ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds to strengthen its voter base and address the ever-changing needs of the American people. Moreover, this change in direction has resulted in a broader spectrum of policy stances, with an increasing number of moderate Republicans who are more open to dialogue and compromise. However, this shift has also led to internal divisions and conflicts as the GOP struggles to unite its various factions and remain grounded in its core principles. There has been a fierce battle between the conservative and more progressive wings of the party, each vying for increased influence and control over the direction the GOP takes in the future. In this context, the rise of the Tea Party movement and the subsequent emergence of right-wing populism has further complicated the efforts to reshape the Republican Party's image and message. Despite these internal struggles, the GOP has continued to make strides in regaining political power, with notable victories in the Senate, House of Representatives, as well as numerous gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country. These accomplishments, along with the increasing presence of Catholic and other minority faith representatives within the party, suggest that the GOP is adapting to the changing realities of the American political landscape, albeit at varying levels of acceptance and pace. As the Republican Party evolves, it will need to strike a delicate balance between honoring its historical roots and embracing the cultural and social changes that are shaping modern America. The challenge will lie in cultivating a platform that resonates with a broad range of voters, while also maintaining cohesion within the party itself. This will require the GOP to actively engage in outreach and dialogue with communities that have historically been marginalized, expand its policy stances beyond the traditional conservative base, and recognize the importance of inclusiveness and unity in forging a path towards future electoral success. In conclusion, the rise of prominent Catholic figures in the Republican Party, alongside an increasing number of individuals from diverse backgrounds, is indicative of an ongoing shifting landscape within the GOP. Moving forward, the party must continue to evolve in sync with the changing American society and muster the courage to let go of exclusionary ideals that no longer serve its interests. By embracing diversity, encouraging dialogue, and finding common ground, the GOP can breathe new life into its identity and continue as a formidable force in American politics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I loved him and he told me he loved me very much.\\" Charity worker Lisa, 36, who was among the mourners at PC Rathband's funeral yesterday, added: \\"Despite knowing he was serious about ending it all I really thought he would make it. \\"I thought we would find a future together. It's all too sad. I miss him terribly. I know I made him happy.\\" Lisa, who was knocked out and had two teeth shattered when the No 30 bus was blown apart in London's Tavistock Square on July 7 2005, also told how she: TALKED PC Rathband out of committing suicide months before he did it. BEGGED him to try to save his marriage to Kath, who had split with him before their relationship, and KNEW he was saying goodbye when she spoke to him hours before he hanged himself at his home in Blyth, Northumberland. Lisa became such a rock to the tormented officer that he stored her name on his phone under \\"Samaritans\\". But throughout their six-month relationship, Kath was always in the background. PC Rathband's family say the bitter wife sent upsetting online messages to Lisa on Twitter, accusing her of being a marriage-wrecker. Kath was also said to have checked on the relationship by studying the cop's phone bill. Lisa said: \\"He often discussed his relationship with Kath with me. I would tell him, 'If there is a chance of you getting back together, it would be a shame if you don't.' But it was clear it was difficult for them both. David was very upset.

Please answer the following question: American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \\"home signs\\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture. Before 1817 deaf people in America _ .

Take social interaction, for example! We now live in an era in which many teenagers spend hours locked away in their bedrooms shooting virtual soldiers and hitting zombies over the head with digital baseball bats, while others sit home alone, chatting with friends, not in person, but through social networks. Teachers, politicians and parents have genuine reasons to argue that young people like this are in danger of losing the ability to connect with one another, to develop genuine relationships and to separate the fictional world of the Xbox or the Play Station from the real world. Others worry about the increasing breakdown of the family unit within the UK and link that to the increase of youth crime and antisocial behavior, or the problems that some young people have with drugs or alcohol. These issues are particularly common in areas of poverty and, in the light of the economic crisis, are unlikely to improve. Indeed, the gap between rich and poor in the UK could well increase, as unemployment figures rise and the cost of higher education increases. But being a teenager in the 21st century is not all doom and gloom, Young people in the UK today can enjoy living in a far more multicultural, integrated society in which opportunities are more equal and which is increasingly environmentally aware. They benefit from better child protection policies, a wider range of educational activities and clearer guidance on leading healthy lifestyles. And as they grow up, this generation will benefit from huge technological inventions which will have an impact on almost every aspect of their lives, from entertainment to transport.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. But I can use this background: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. What is an answer for this question: Would rad A have longer or shorter wavelengths than rad B? Answer:","completion":"Rad A, which represents the Sun's radiations, would have shorter wavelengths than rad B, which represents Earth's radiations. The Sun emits solar radiation (sunlight) that reaches the Earth, and this solar radiation is generally characterized by shorter wavelengths, such as ultraviolet, visible, and some near-infrared light. On the other hand, the Earth absorbs some of this solar radiation and then emits radiation back into space at longer wavelengths. These longer wavelengths of Earth's radiation primarily consist of thermal infrared radiation, which is also associated with heat. The longer wavelengths emitted by Earth are not visible to the human eye, unlike the shorter wavelengths of solar radiation which include the visible light spectrum. In summary, rad A (Sun's radiations) has shorter wavelengths, while rad B (Earth's radiations) has longer wavelengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: The Catholic Church had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: The event that ended religious unity in the Western Church is widely considered to be the Protestant Reformation. This pivotal moment in history, which took place during the 16th century, saw the rise of various Protestant movements that sought to reform the Catholic Church and break away from its traditions and teachings. These reform movements contributed to a schism within the Western Church, ultimately putting an end to the religious unity that had once characterized the region. The roots of the Protestant Reformation can be traced back to various factors, including the perceived corruption within the Church hierarchy, the Church's political influence, the sale of indulgences, and the growing influence of humanism and the Renaissance. The Reformation was ignited when Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk and theology professor, nailed his Ninety-five Theses on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517. His bold act of defiance against the Church's teachings sparked widespread debate, leading to the rapid spread of Protestant ideas across Europe. Some of the key figures who advanced the cause of the Reformation included John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and John Knox. The development of the printing press aided the dissemination of Protestant ideas, as religious pamphlets and translations of the Bible became increasingly accessible to the masses. European rulers and individuals were faced with the choice of remaining loyal to the Catholic Church or endorsing the new Protestant beliefs. The Reformation led to the emergence of several new branches of Christianity, such as Lutheranism, Reformed Christianity (Calvinism), Anabaptism, and Anglicanism, as many people sought to redefine their faith based on a personal relationship with God and reliance on the guidance of the Bible. This profoundly altered the religious landscape of the Western Church, as believers, who had once belonged to a single, unified institution, were now part of various denominations with vastly different practices and beliefs. Additionally, these religious divisions caused political, social, and cultural tensions, leading to numerous conflicts, such as the infamous Thirty Years' War. In conclusion, the event that ended religious unity in the Western Church is the Protestant Reformation, a period in which reformers challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and sought to reform its ecclesiastical structures. The Reformation shattered the unity of the Western Church and paved the way for the formation of multiple Christian denominations with varying beliefs and practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Saga, who had a history of gambling addiction, misused the money intended for the trip, choosing instead to indulge in a reckless lifestyle and fuel his insatiable gambling habit. Parents, students, and well-wishers had been sending him payments to cover trip expenses, including lodging, transportation, and sightseeing, only to discover that their hard-earned money had been used to fund the personal exploits of a dishonest and deceitful man. The elaborate web of deceit spun by Calliope Saga involved sending regular emails to parents, teachers, and students, assuring them that the trip was on schedule and providing updates on the progress of bookings and arrangement details. These messages were carefully crafted to give the impression that everything was going smoothly, even as suspicions began to arise. The carefully woven illusion he had created lulled everyone into a false sense of security and trust – until it all came crashing down. When the truth finally emerged, the town was left reeling, struggling to comprehend how such an individual had managed to deceive them on such a grand scale. The families who had invested their time, money, and faith in the high school trip were left with feelings of betrayal, anger, and disappointment. In court, Calliope 'Ope' Saga did not even have the decency to face the families he had so callously deceived, refusing to acknowledge the harm and pain his actions had caused. After a brief trial period, he was released on bond and told to return in two to three months for sentencing. The town of Willard and its residents have struggled to move on from the shocking scandal that tainted their community. The actions of one man, motivated by greed and personal gain, not only undermined the trust and faith of an entire town, but also robbed a group of young, eager learners of a unique opportunity to explore and engage with the world around them. As the dust settles and the story of Calliope 'Ope' Saga fades into the background, an important lesson remains: the importance of trust and the devastating consequences that ensue when it is betrayed. In rebuilding their community and preparing for the future, the people of Willard, Missouri must learn not to lose faith in each other, even as they seek to heal and move on from the actions of one selfish man. Meanwhile, Calliope Saga will have to live with the knowledge that his reckless actions and selfish gambling habits caused untold damage to innocent lives, leaving behind a legacy of betrayal and shattered dreams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"Imagine you are playing a game in your classroom where all the kids get to vote for their favorite snack. To make sure the voting is fair, your teacher wants to be sure that all the kids vote just once and are actually part of the class. Requiring voter identification is like your teacher asking for your name and looking at the class list to check if you belong there. This way, no one from another class or outsiders can try to vote in your class's game. Adding an identification check helps with: 1. Preventing someone from pretending to be someone else. Like when two friends try to vote as the same person or claim to be a friend who's absent in the class. 2. Making sure everyone counts their vote once. It's like when your teacher gives you one token to put in your favorite snack's jar. Without the token, no one can vote again, and it can't be mixed up. 3. Ensuring that all voters are in the right place. Just like our classroom example, a voting place should only have people who live in that location. This is to ensure that everyone's choice is based on where they live. Voter identification helps to confirm this. So, asking for the voter identification at the voting place will help in a way to keep the voting process more accurate and fair. Your teacher can then count the votes with confidence, knowing that the results are a true representation of your classroom's choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: The Holographic UniverseIf you're interested in new universal models based on quantum theories, I'd really recommend just picking up Michael Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe.\\" He essentially says the same thing, but his English is much easier to digest, and he manages to make quantum function seem as fascinating as it should to the layman, whereas Goswami tends to describe the same experiments in utterly boring, repetitive detail. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review is mixed. It seems that the reviewer found the concept of the book compelling, hence the \\"Great concept\\" part, suggesting some positive aspect. However, they also mention that the book is \\"poorly written\\" and describe the writing as \\"utterly boring, repetitive detail\\", which is quite negative. On a positive note, the reviewer recommends an alternative source on the same topic, highlighting Michael Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe\\" as having better, more accessible writing and making quantum function fascinating. This suggests that there is still positivity in how they appreciate the subject matter and the potential of the topic, they just believe it could be better executed in terms of writing style.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit had a longer shelf life because of better preservation, apples or peaches? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, apples had a longer shelf life due to better preservation. Dan candied apples, whereas Joey candied peaches. Joey faced the issue of humidity in the room, which caused moisture levels to rise and potentially led to fermentation, negatively affecting the fruit's preservation. Since Dan did not have humidity issues when candying the apples, their preservation was more successful, resulting in a longer shelf life compared to the peaches. It is essential to control the environment during the sugaring process to ensure the desired preservation outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a £3.65bn (4.75bn) settlement for its role in the sale of risky mortgage products in the US before the financial crisis. Article:","completion":"Title: Royal Bank of Scotland Reaches 4.75 Billion Settlement for Risky Mortgage Products in the U.S. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has recently reached a settlement of £3.65 billion (approximately 4.75 billion) for its alleged involvement in the sales of toxic mortgage-backed securities that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. This marks a significant milestone in the bank's ongoing efforts to resolve historical issues, as the settlement highlights RBS's responsibility for their role in exacerbating the financial crisis. Before diving into the details and implications of the settlement, it's essential to provide some context about RBS's involvement in the financial crisis. RBS was among several other major banks that sold complex financial products known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the years leading up to the crisis. These securities were created by pooling mortgages from homeowners, with the borrowers' loan repayments providing income streams to investors. However, many of these mortgage loans were subprime, meaning that they were made to borrowers with poor credit ratings and an increased risk of default. As a result, when housing prices plummeted in 2008, a significant number of homeowners defaulted on their loans, causing the value of these securities to collapse and subsequently leading to the financial crisis. The settlement between RBS and the US authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), finally puts an end to an extensive investigation into the bank's role in the sale of risky mortgage products in the United States. The £3.65 billion (4.75 billion) settlement includes a combination of fines and compensation to the investors who suffered losses due to these mortgage-backed securities. RBS's settlement with the US authorities sends a strong message to the financial community that engagement in dishonest or unethical practices will not be tolerated. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of proper risk management in the banking industry to prevent similar financial crises from happening in the future. Banks and other financial institutions must employ thorough due diligence processes when selling complex financial products to investors and should make it a priority to maintain transparency and ethical standards when conducting business. For RBS, this settlement also represents a considerable step forward in the bank's ongoing restructuring and return to its core strengths. Since the financial crisis, RBS has been undergoing a transformation, selling or closing various non-core businesses and assets, shrinking its balance sheet, and significantly reducing its risk profile. RBS also announced plans to cut an additional 530 jobs in an ongoing effort to lower costs and improve efficiency, as it moves towards being a more focused and sustainable bank. Nevertheless, the bank's recovery process has not been without obstacles. This settlement marks the latest in a series of legal challenges and penalties related to RBS's conduct during the financial crisis, which have collectively cost the bank billions of dollars. In the coming years, RBS will have to continue facing the consequences of its past actions, as well as navigating a rapidly changing and increasingly regulated financial environment. In conclusion, the Royal Bank of Scotland's 4.75 billion settlement for its role in selling risky mortgage products in the U.S. before the financial crisis highlights the continuing efforts to hold financial institutions accountable for their actions during this turbulent time in history. While the settlement enables RBS to take a significant step forward in its ongoing revival, it also serves as a stark reminder for other financial institutions to prioritize risk management and ethical practices in their operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US?

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971,...

Please write a short summary for the following article: South Korea Launches Plan to Drive Out Older Cars SEOUL—South Korea has announced stricter emissions standards for vehicles starting next year, as part of efforts to clean up the air in its major cities. The Ministry of Environment said Thursday that old diesel-powered vehicles weighing 2.5 tons or more will be banned from Seoul if they aren’t equipped with an emission-reducing device or a low-pollution engine. The ban will be extended to Incheon and 17 other cities in Gyeonggi province in 2018, and to the remaining metropolitan areas in 2020. A diesel car produced before 2005 emits eight times more bad gases than the latest models that meet the toughened Euro 6 standards, the ministry said in a statement. About 1.04 million vehicles will be subject to the regulations. Cars that violate the regulations will be fined 200,000 won (180) per detection, it said. The ministry said it would help partially finance the costs needed for low-income drivers and smaller firms to buy the latest diesel cars or equip their vehicles with emission-reducing devices. Diesel-powered vehicles have risen in popularity in Korea in recent years, largely because of better fuel efficiency than gasoline-powered cars and a shift in consumer appetite to sport-utility vehicles. Diesel cars account for more than half of newly registered vehicles in Korea. The latest measures come after Korea in May found that some diesel vehicles emitted up to 21 times more nitrogen oxides on the roads than at laboratories in tests conducted in the wake of Volkswagen AG VLKAY 1.69 % ’s admission last year that it falsified U.S. emissions tests on some diesel-powered cars. On Tuesday, Korea banned the sale of almost all Volkswagen cars after revoking the certifications of 80 models and handed down heavy fines, saying the German auto maker faked documents on emissions and noise-level tests. Following the Volkswagen scandal, the country has taken a series of measures to address growing public concerns about air pollution, with a view to bringing its air quality to the levels of some advanced European countries. Last month, the government said it will cut consumption taxes for consumers who turn in diesel-engine cars that are at least 10 years old when purchasing a new car. Korea also plans to spend 5 trillion won (4.48 billion) by 2020 to have more green cars on the road and improve air quality. Some cities in Europe have also taken steps to tackle air pollution. Paris last month launched a ban on cars registered before 1997 during weekday daylight hours, while London is considering introducing an extra charge on polluting cars entering the center of town.

Answer the question...who is responsible for the abo classification system??","completion":"The ABO blood classification system is the result of the pioneering work of Austrian scientist Dr. Karl Landsteiner, who is credited with discovering human blood groups in 1900-1901. Dr. Landsteiner identified the presence of various blood antigens and antibodies, which are responsible for the ABO blood group system, ushering in significant advancements in the field of transfusion medicine, immunology, and hematology. Karl Landsteiner was born in Vienna, Austria, on June 14, 1868. He began his professional career by entering the field of medicine after receiving his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1891 from the University of Vienna. He went on to study chemistry, and worked under the guidance of Hermann Emil Fischer, a German chemist, and Nobel Prize laureate. After completing his education, Landsteiner worked in various pathology laboratories in Vienna. His interest in serology and the interaction between blood and the immune system led him to investigate blood transfusion reactions. While working in the Department of Pathology at the University of Vienna, Dr. Landsteiner conducted a series of experiments in which he mixed blood samples from different individuals. He observed that the red blood cells of certain individuals clumped when mixed with the plasma from other individuals. This observation led to the identification of the ABO blood group system. Dr. Landsteiner classified human blood into four groups – A, B, AB, and O – based on the presence or absence of specific antigens (A and B) on the surface of red blood cells and the corresponding antibodies in the plasma. The existence of these antigens and antibodies determines the compatibility of blood for transfusion, making Landsteiner's discovery crucial for the development of safe blood transfusion practices. His work on the ABO blood group system earned him international recognition and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Later in his career, Landsteiner moved to the United States to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, where he discovered additional human blood group systems, including the Rhesus (Rh) factor in collaboration with Alexander S. Wiener in 1937. In conclusion, Dr. Karl Landsteiner is the principal scientist responsible for the discovery and development of the ABO blood classification system. His profound contributions to medicine have saved countless lives through improved blood transfusion safety and enhanced understanding of the human immune system. Today, the ABO blood group system remains crucial for medical practice worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.:273 In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars ). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.:646 Who gained an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce?","completion":"After the Battle of Podhajce, it was the Commonwealth forces under Hetman John Sobieski who gained an armistice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A celebrated descent from antiquity (the Bagratid \\"line\\") begins with Arsaces. Arsaces or Ashk has also given name to the city of Ashkabad. - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - Mithridates III of Parthia ( Persian : ) ruled the Parthian Empire c. 57 -- 54 BC. Mithridates was a son of Phraates III , whom he murdered in 57 BC , with the assistance of his brother Orodes . Orodes became king of Parthia and made Mithridates king of Media , a Parthian client state . On account of his cruelty , Orodes turned on his brother and disposed him . Mithridates was forced to flee from Media to Roman Syria . He took refuge with Aulus Gabinius , the Roman proconsul and governor of Syria . Mithridates then returned to invade Parthia with Gabinius in support . The Roman proconsul marched with Mithridates to the Euphrates , but turned back to restore another ruler , Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt , to his throne . Despite losing his Roman support , Mithridates advanced into Mesopotamia and managed to conquer Babylonia . He ousted Orodes and briefly restored his reign as king in 55 BC , minting coins in Seleucia until 54 BC. However , king Mithridates was besieged by Orodes ' general , Surena , in Seleucia , and after a prolonged resistance , offered battle to Orodes ' forces and was defeated . Mithridates was taken prisoner and executed in 54 BC by Orodes . - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great.

Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer.

Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company.

But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help.

After admitting last week she mimed the US national anthem at President Obama's inauguration, critics were keen to scrutinise Beyonce's show. But the New York Times was one of many that said she had now \\"silenced her doubters\\". \\"She balanced explosions and humanity, imperiousness with warmth, an arena-ready sense of scale with a microscopic approach to the details of her vocals,\\" wrote Jon Caramanica. \\"Amid all the loudness were small things to indicate Beyonce was answering her sceptics, quietly but effectively. Beyonce the machine had made her point. This was proof of life.\\" Dressed in a black leather mini dress, the singer kicked off the show with a blaze of flames while she sang a brief a cappella version of her single Love on Top before launching into mega hit Crazy In Love. Billboard Magazine said the performance was \\"easily one of the best ever\\" half-time shows. \\"She strutted towards the front of the stage in her black leather dress and booties looking like Catwoman, it was obvious that it likely would be the last time she did anything at medium pace,\\" Brad Wete said. After stripping down to a leotard, she also performed tracks End of Time, Baby Boy and Halo, while her Destiny's Child band mates joined her on stage to give renditions of Bootylicious, Independent Women Part I and Single Ladies. The Washington Post said the show was \\"the sexiest Super Bowl half-time since 2004\\" when the infamous Janet Jackson \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" occurred. Since that event, organisers had opted for \\"safer\\" rock acts from the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and The Who, until last year when Madonna landed the gig. The New York Daily News praised the show saying: \\"Beyonce gave an absolutely live Super Bowl halftime performance that killed.\\" \\"Given both Beyonce's persona and talent, only a fool would have bet against her at this particular event.

None involved submitting to doubters,\\" Randall Roberts said. Jerry Shriver from USA Today described the show as a \\"dynamic half-time performance that apparently sucked all of the power out of the Superdome\\" - in reference to a power cut during the game shortly after Beyonce's set. However Shriver's colleague Chris Strauss said the set \\"seemed perfunctory\\" to the football fans in the stadium. \\"While viewers at home seemed pleased by the 12-minute set, it was hard for fans in the stadium to experience the same kind of HD clarity, audio superiority and multi-angle close-ups that the CBS broadcast audience could,\\" he said. \\"The performance wasn't designed for the people in the crowd. While the energy among the hundreds of fans ushered in along the field for the performance might have been different, fans up top didn't seem to have much reaction.\\" It is thought more than 100 million people would have watched the half-time show, although final figures have yet to be released. After the performance, Beyonce also announced the details of a new world tour. It will begin in Belgrade, Serbia, on 15 April before heading to the UK for six dates, including four nights at London's O2 Arena.

Bystanders at the scene recall a frenzied atmosphere as panicked onlookers alerted zoo staff to the precarious situation. The boy's parents hastily climbed into the enclosure to retrieve their son, while zoo employees dialed 9-1-1 to inform first responders and request medical assistance. Against all odds, the cheetahs did not approach or harm the child during the ordeal. The rapid response of the child's parents, as well as the diligence of zoo staff, ensured that they were able to rescue him with only minor injuries, mainly bumps and bruises from the fall. After being quickly attended to by emergency personnel, the boy was taken to a nearby hospital for further evaluation. The Zoo's Response Understandably, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is taking this event very seriously, both for the safety of their visitors and the conservation of the cheetahs in their care. The zoo has stated that it will be pressing charges against the child's mother due to her reckless endangerment of her son and the potential threat posed to the precious animals. \\"We will be pressing charges to hold the individual accountable for her actions,\\" the zoo's executive director, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, shared in a press conference. \\"This situation created a very real threat to both the cheetahs and the individuals putting themselves at risk to save the child.\\" Following the accident, the zoo conducted a review of its safety protocols, ultimately determining that they are satisfactory in ensuring visitor safety. However, Dr. Kuhar emphasized the vital need for guests to adhere to these guidelines at all times, especially when visiting potentially hazardous exhibits. \\"The safety of our guests and animals is a top priority,\\" Dr. Kuhar explained. \\"Our barriers and safety procedures are in place for the welfare of the animals and the public. It is essential that visitors follow these protocols at all times.\\" Implications for Animal Welfare This unfortunate event has also highlighted the potential hazards that captive animals face when humans recklessly encroach upon their living spaces. A worst-case scenario in such incidents could involve seriously harming or even killing the animals or their human intruders. Conservation efforts for critically endangered species, like the cheetah, may be substantially hampered by such encounters, stressing the irreplaceable importance of sound zoo management. In light of this disturbing incident, zoo authorities and animal welfare advocates alike are urging the public to exercise common sense and responsibility when visiting these educational establishments. Our ever-decreasing proximity to nature offers valuable insights into the lives of exotic and endangered species. Still, this comes with an equally undeniable duty to ensure that our curiosity does not endanger the creatures we aim to protect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Testing reveals Facebook iOS app drains battery life, even when it isn’t being used, and that using Safari instead will make an iPhone last longer Facebook is one of the most downloaded apps on iOS but it has long been cited as a cause of fast-draining iPhone batteries. Last year it was accused of using background tricks to stay active even when it wasn’t being used. Facebook admitted bugs existed, and fixed them, but questions of the app’s impact on battery life remained. Similar concerns about Facebook’s Android app led to the discovery that deleting the app saves up to 20% of a phone’s battery. After that revelation, I set about seeing if the same was true for iPhone users. I discovered that uninstalling Facebook’s iOS app and switching to Safari can save up to 15% of iPhone battery life. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An alternative to uninstalling Facebook is using the hump from Apple’s Smart Battery case. Photograph: Apple Using an iPhone 6S Plus for a week without the main Facebook app installed, I recorded the battery life at 10.30pm each day for a week comparing it to a daily average taken from a week with the app. I charged the phone overnight, taking it off the charger at 7.30am, and used it normally. I accessed Facebook for the same amount of time, and for the same purposes, using the social network’s excellent mobile site within Safari, as I had done using the app. I also left the Facebook Messenger app installed. On average I had 15% more battery left by 10.30pm each day. I had also saved space, because at the point I had deleted the Facebook app it had consumed around 500MB in total combining the 111MB of the app itself and its cache on the iPhone. To make sure that this wasn’t an isolated incident, I also recruited several other Facebook-using iPhone owners to conduct a similar test. They all found similar results, with increased battery life when using Facebook in Safari having uninstalled the main Facebook iOS app. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Spot the difference: one is the Facebook app, the other the Facebook mobile site. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Using Facebook in Safari was almost as good as the app. You can even place a shortcut to Facebook in Safari on the homescreen that looks almost identical to the app’s icon (the white is a little less bright but you need eagle eyes to see). The only restriction was the Share-to function, which does not exist for websites, meaning that to share photos I had to manually hit the “post photos” button on the mobile site. Features of the app, such as Instant Articles, are also not available. Tapping a link on the Facebook mobile site opens a new Safari tab. The results will vary for the smaller iPhone 6S, as it has a smaller battery and shorter battery life overall, but judging by the 6S Plus experience, removing the Facebook app in preference of using the social network in Safari will extend the battery life of any iPhone. A Facebook spokesperson said the company was investigating the matter. ||||| Facebook’s Android app negatively impacts performance and battery life, even when it’s only running in the background, users find Facebook does not have the greatest track record with its Android app. Users have long complained about performance issues and it sucking up battery and last year Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, took the unusual step of making his staff ditch their iPhones and move to Android until they sorted out the issues. But the problems have remained, and recently they led the Android blogger Russell Holly to dump the app, starting a chain reaction which revealed something rather interesting about the app’s performance. Prompted by Holly’s revelation that life on Android was better without Facebook’s app, Reddit user pbrandes_eth tested the app’s impact on the performance of an LG G4. They found that when the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps were uninstalled, other apps on the smartphone launched 15% faster. They tested 15 separate apps, and documented the findings, leading other reddit users to test other devices. They found similar results when testing for app loading performance. After reading Holly’s piece, I had also decided to explore other options for accessing Facebook, to see if, rather than app loading, I could improve my smartphone’s battery life. I left the Facebook Messenger app installed, but swapped the Facebook app for an app called Metal, which acts as a wrapper for Facebook’s mobile site. Over the course of a day my Huawei Nexus 6P had 20% more battery. This was true on average for every day for the week tried. In Metal I was using the same notifications and accessing the same features as I had just a week earlier through the Facebook app, so why the difference? Despite the Facebook app not showing up as using a significant amount of power within Android’s built-in battery statistics, it was evidently consuming more power in the background than it needed to. It turned out other Android services including Android system and Android OS showed reduced battery consumption when the Facebook app was uninstalled. Those services act as a buffer for many apps to the outside world when running in the background. So while Facebook didn’t look like it was using that much power, it was actually just being displayed elsewhere in Android’s statistics. So, uninstalling the Facebook app saves both battery and speeds up Android phones, it seems. Obviously, it may be less convenient not to have the apps, but there are several substitutes that allow you to access the mobile site within a wrapper, like Metal that I used. Alternatively, you can simply use Facebook within Chrome on an Android phone: recent updates have enabled notifications for actions, chats and other features from Facebook even in the background, meaning the experience is very similar to using an app. Either way, until Facebook improves its Android app, ditching it could save you 20% of your battery life a day, and speed up your phone. A Facebook spokesperson said: “We have heard reports of some people experiencing speed issues stemming from our Android app. We are looking into this and will keep you posted. We are committed to continuing to improve these issues.” The company made no mention of battery life issues, however. |||||Summary:","completion":"Recent testing has revealed that the Facebook iOS app, one of the most downloaded apps on iOS, drains battery life even when it isn’t being used.

Given the question \\"What will Sasha do after that?\\", is \\"laugh at her brother\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"laugh at her brother\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Sasha do after that?\\" as it does not take into consideration the context and possible consequences of her action. However, it is important to note that identifying a single valid response to this question can be challenging since it depends on multiple factors, including Sasha's personality, her relationship with her brother, and the reactions of her friends. There are several possible scenarios that Sasha may experience following her disclosure of her brother's secret. Below, we explore some potential outcomes to provide a more in-depth answer to the question: 1. Regret and Apology: Sasha may realize that she made a mistake in sharing her brother's secret, potentially jeopardizing their relationship and his trust in her. In this case, Sasha might feel remorse, apologize to her brother, and make a promise not to reveal his confidential information in the future. 2. Facing the Consequences: Sasha's brother may become aware of her actions, leading to a conflict between the siblings. He may feel betrayed and hurt, which could cause emotional turmoil or temporary distance in their relationship. Depending on the severity of the secret, Sasha might need to make amends for her actions in order to rebuild trust and strengthen the bond with her brother. 3. Learning a Lesson: Sasha could take this experience as an opportunity for introspection and self-improvement, recognizing the importance of respecting others' privacy and boundaries. By learning from this error in judgment, Sasha can develop greater empathy and maturity in her relationships with her brother and others. 4. Addressing Her Friends: Sasha might decide to speak to her friends about the consequences of her revelation and ask them not to spread the secret further.

His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty.

It may indicate the emotion of angry. Dialogue 2: 'i will slap on your chics do you scream yes joker' This dialogue also has a negative tone and shows aggression (slap, scream, and joker). It suggests the emotion of angry as well. Therefore, both dialogues seem to have the same underlying emotion, which is angry. Output: yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:This week's departure of coach Ian Millward appeared inevitable after barely 3,000 fans turned up to watch a ninth successive game without victory, a 40-24 defeat to Huddersfield. The Tigers have won just once in 18 games and have lost their chief executive, commercial manager and now head coach during a painful middle year of the current three-year licence period. The manner of Millward's departure highlighted the Tigers' problems. The news was leaked and widely known on Tuesday morning but only finally made public by the club that evening, during which time the one update to their official website was of its £100 Daily Draw winner. Interestingly, the club statement referred to the team's results as \\"unacceptable for all concerned, including sponsors and supporters\\". Millward may feel he was dealt a rough hand after being appointed as part of a long-term plan. He has made many improvements to the daily operation around the team, including increased use of video analysis but, crucially, on the field there has been no improvement and he has paid the price. An impressive win over champions Leeds and a gutsy draw against the Catalan Dragons offered a glimpse of the quality in the squad and the players may feel they have to take a large share of responsibility for Millward's departure. It leaves the club's fans, staff and former players wondering what the future holds. Former Great Britain forward Lee Crooks, who played over 200 times for the Tigers, is hugely concerned. \\"The club is in turmoil at the moment and unless someone comes along with £1m then I am very worried about where Castleford might be heading,\\" he said. \\"There need to be big changes.\\" When Steve Ferres walked away as chief executive in February after just six months in the job he warned that unless things changed then Castleford Tigers would simply not be able to generate enough income to exist as a Super League club. The ideal is that change would be a new stadium, or an improved version of the club's dated Wheldon Road home, but it is hard to envisage that scenario while the team toils on the field and the fans stay away. Ferres' replacement Steve Gill, promoted from his role as head of youth development, has been charged with the responsibility of turning the club's fortunes around by owner Jack Fulton. Danny Orr will take temporary charge of the team. The decision on who should replace Millward is vital to both ensure the fans are onside and get one of rugby league's most famous old names firing again. Full Super League table The club has already assembled a new-look commercial team and attention now turns to finding the right head coach. Gill says the new man could be named within a fortnight if it is a Briton, but he is willing to wait longer if a suitable overseas candidate is available. John Kear and former Hull KR coach Justin Morgan will again be frontrunners. Batley are unlikely to stop Kear if there is a chance of him returning to a Super League job. He once called Castleford his dream job, but circumstances for both club and individual have since changed. The Tigers may look closer to home at highly rated Featherstone boss Daryl Powell. That could give the former Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain international a dilemma. Powell is well established at the successful Championship club, and would have to decide whether his longer-term Super League prospects are at Post Office Road if he was offered a top-flight role now. Andy Hay could be another contender. The former Tigers forward is Castleford through and through but remains untried in the main role after moving from Cas to Hull as their assistant coach. Whoever takes over will find that there is as much quality in the squad as there is concern around it. In Justin Carney, Rangi Chase, Jordan Thompson, Michael Shenton and Weller Hauraki, there is enough flair in this Tigers team to convince the new man in charge that a position at the foot of Super League is a huge misrepresentation of where Castleford should be. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"In this article, a sports team called the Castleford Tigers has been facing some problems. Their coach, Ian Millward, had to leave because they were not winning games. They have only won one game in 18 tries. People are worried about the team's future, and they need to find a new coach to help them do better. Some people think the team has very good players, but they need a good leader to help them win games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

LV Osprey entered service as a Light Vessel for the Commissioners of Irish Lights in 1955. On 9 May 1975 she was sold to the New Ross Harbour Commissioners for use as a floating oil berth pilot station and harbour store. On March 1998 she was sold again and moored on the Seine. Le Batofar ignited the night club on boat trend in Paris. This lighthouse boat (in French bateau-phare) offers an original setting on the bank of the Seine in the 13th arrondissement.

The paragraph is about a Light Vessel named LV Osprey that has changed ownership and purpose over time, eventually becoming a nightclub on the Seine river in Paris. Step 2: Review the list of categories provided: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, or written work. Step 3: Identify the category that best matches the information given in the paragraph. We can eliminate the following categories, as they don't apply to the information provided: educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, and written work. Step 4: Determine the category that makes the most sense based on the remaining options. While LV Osprey was a means of transportation and was used in different roles (such as a Light Vessel, floating oil berth pilot station, and harbor store), the main focus of the paragraph is its transformation into a nightclub on a boat in Paris, which is a unique and interesting setting. Step 5: Justify the chosen category. The category \\"mean of transportation\\" fits the history and functions of LV Osprey described in the paragraph, but its current role as a nightclub and the unique setting in Paris makes it stand out. While it's not a building per se, it serves a similar purpose as a stationary location for entertainment. Based on the context and the categories provided, the most appropriate category for the paragraph would be \\"mean of transportation,\\" even though its current role leans more toward a building or entertainment venue. The paragraph focuses more on the vessel itself and its journey through different roles, so \\"mean of transportation\\" remains the best fit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates helped usher in the next chapter for the United States in Iraq on Wednesday, presiding over a ceremony launching a new military operation designed to train, assist and advise the Iraqis. The ceremony, held at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, marked the conclusion of the U.S. combat mission dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transfer to the assistance mission, named Operation New Dawn. Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III replaced Gen. Raymond T. Odierno as commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq in the changeover, held at one of the many palaces of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- whose regime was ousted from power in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. \\" OPTIONS: - Al Faw Palace is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Baghdad is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Biden is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - CNN is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Iraq is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Iraqi is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Iraqis is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Joe Biden is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,\\" Obama said. - Lloyd J.

Surely, they could have chosen a much better tenor, like Jose Carerras or Roberto Alagna. Renee Fleming does have a charming voice, and Borodina has great depth in her emotion, but these two don't seem to fit as a balanced cast in this requiem by Verdi. And personally, I prefer Gergiev conducting the Russian operas, not an Italian piece.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this version of Verdi's requiem to anyone. Bocelli is just not operatic with his voice. He should stick with his Pop music and stay away from Puccini, Donizetti, etc.I would recommend conductor Emil Tabakov's version, with singers Romanko, Ombuena, and de Grandis.

Question 2: What is the best way to learn to write well in english? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Task: Provide answers to the two questions and analyze whether the answers would be the same. Step 1: Analyze the first question. The first question focuses on using music as a tool for learning English. Essentially, the user is trying to understand if listening to music is an effective method to improve their English skills. Step 2: Answer the first question. Yes, listening to music can be helpful for learning English as it exposes you to natural language, new vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions. Additionally, music can make language learning more enjoyable and enhance memorization through repetition and rhythm. However, depending solely on music for English language learning may not be sufficient. Other methods and language learning materials should be incorporated to have a comprehensive understanding of the language. Step 3: Analyze the second question. The second question focuses on the best way to improve English writing skills. It seeks advice on which method or approach would be most effective for learning to write well in English. Step 4: Answer the second question. The best way to learn to write well in English is through a combination of methods, including reading various materials (books, articles, blogs, etc.) to observe sentence structure, vocabulary, and styles; practicing writing regularly to improve grammar, spelling, and coherence; seeking feedback from others such as peers, teachers, or writing groups; and using online resources or apps to address specific difficulties or learning gaps. Step 5: Compare the answers. While both answers involve ways to improve English skills, they are not the same. The first question focuses primarily on using music as a means to learn the language, while the second question is about the most effective approach to improve English writing skills.

Written accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries described flocks so large that they darkened the sky for hours. It was calculated that when its population reached its highest point, there were more than 3 billion passenger pigeons--a number equal to 24 to 40 percent of the total bird population in the United States, making it perhaps the most abundant bird in the world. Even as late as 1870 when their numbers had already become smaller, a flock believed to be 1 mile wide and 320 miles (about 515 kilometers) long was seen near Cincinnati. Sadly, the abundance of passenger pigeons may have been their _ . Where the birds were most abundant, people believed there was an ever-lasting supply and killed them by the thousands. Commercial hunters attracted them to small clearings with grain, waited until pigeons had settled to feed, then threw large nets over them, taking hundreds at a time. The birds were shipped to large cities and sold in restaurants. By the closing decades of the 19th century, the hardwood forests where passenger pigeons nested had been damaged by Americans' need for wood, which scattered the flocks and forced the birds to go farther north, where cold temperatures and spring storms contributed to their decline. Soon the great flocks were gone, never to be seen again. In 1897, the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the killing of passenger pigeons, but by then, no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for 10 years. The last confirmed wild pigeon in the United States was shot by a boy in Pike County, Ohio, in 1900. For a time, a few birds survived under human care. The last of them, known affectionately as Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden on September 1, 1914. Question: What can we infer about the law passed in Michigan?

In this context, the statement discusses the importance of considering the principle of subsidiarity when dealing with the issue of building regulations and legislative provisions in the European Union (EU) member states. The principle of subsidiarity is an essential concept in the EU, which states that decisions must be made as close to the citizens as possible, and that larger governing bodies (such as the EU) should only intervene when necessary. In this case, the text emphasizes the importance of individual member states incorporating the relevant EU provisions regarding buildings into their national legislation. These provisions include Eurocode 8, which is a set of European standards for the design of buildings in areas where earthquakes pose a significant risk. Eurocode 8 provides guidelines for designing new buildings so that they can withstand the forces generated by severe earthquakes, ensuring the safety of occupants and minimizing the potential for loss of life and property damage. Additionally, the text refers to the provisions concerning the consolidation of old buildings. This involves the need to retrofit and strengthen existing structures, especially those built before the introduction of modern building codes and standards, in order to ensure their resilience in the event of an earthquake or other natural disasters. The process of consolidating old buildings typically includes structural reinforcement, such as adding bracing elements or upgrading connections between structural components, and may also involve non-structural improvements, such as installing fire-resistant materials. In conclusion, the statement emphasizes that EU member states should work to incorporate the relevant EU provisions concerning building regulations, including Eurocode 8 and measures for the consolidation of old buildings, into their national legislation. By doing so, member states would be able to maintain their competence in this issue while also ensuring a consistent approach to earthquake-resistant design and construction across the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chaotic thought patterns are a result of teenagers' brains containing too much grey matter -- the cell bodies and connections which carry messages within the brain. As we age, the amount of grey matter in our brain reduces. \\"What our research has shown is that there is simply too much going on in the brains of teens,\\" said Blakemore. \\"The result is that their brain energy and resources are wasted and their decision-making process is badly influenced.

She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own. Looking at Violet's Bible, Jerry finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after Violet's daughter Nell. Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping that Nell was conceived through rape. Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher working with autistic children.

Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell's behavior while Jerry chooses to stay in Nell's cabin and quietly observe.

We can achieve this by subtracting 229638 from both sides of the equation to keep the balance. -4785*k + 229638 - 229638 = -334992 - 229638 This simplifies to: -4785*k = -564630 Step 2: Solve for k Now, we have an equation where the only term on the left side is -4785*k. To find the value of k, we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by -4785. (-4785*k) / -4785 = -564630 / -4785 On the left side, the -4785 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving just k: k = 118 So, the solution for the equation -4785*k + 229638 = -334992 is k = 118."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck.

Background: Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were an English avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, along with arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn and music journalist Paul Morley. The group had international Top 20 hits with \\"Kiss\\" and the instrumental \\"Peter Gunn\\", which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. Context: By 1987, the band's membership was down to just Jeczalik and Dudley. That year saw the release of their album In No Sense? Nonsense! The album featured Jeczalik's most advanced rhythmic collages to date, plus lush string arrangements, pieces for boys' choir, and keyboard melodies from Dudley. It did not produce any hits, although their record label made efforts to push remixes of \\"Dragnet\\" into the dance clubs and the single reached No. 60 on the UK charts. In 1987, The Art of Noise provided the score for two movies, Hiding Out and Dragnet, and one particular movement was used in both films. Their brass-based connecting passage between sections from the original Dragnet television show's theme song was used as incidental music during a dramatic scene--an armed chase through the rafters of a gymnasium--near the end of Hiding Out. In 1988, a one-off collaboration with singer Tom Jones (a cover of Prince's \\"Kiss\\"--a staple in Jones' stage shows) renewed the public's interest in the Art of Noise and provided the group's biggest hit in the mainstream. The track appeared on several albums by Jones, and China Records included the song on the greatest hits compilation The Best of The Art of Noise, the first edition of which also contained tracks licensed from ZTT. The follow-up album, Below the Waste, failed to achieve much success upon its release in 1989. While it did spawn the memorable single \\"Yebo!\\" (featuring the unique vocals of Zulu performers Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens). Both cassette and CD versions include two bonus tracks in the form of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\", and the \\"James Bond Theme\\". In 1990, Dudley and Jeczalik declared that the Art of Noise had officially disbanded. Question: Who was in the band during this period?. Whats the answer?","completion":"During the period between 1987 and 1990, the Art of Noise primarily consisted of two members: programmer J. J. Jeczalik and arranger Anne Dudley. The band had initially started in 1983 with Gary Langan, Trevor Horn, and Paul Morley, but by 1987, Langan, Horn, and Morley had left, leaving Jeczalik and Dudley as the remaining members. During this period, the Art of Noise released their album \\"In No Sense? Nonsense!\\" in 1987, provided scores for two movies - \\"Hiding Out\\" and \\"Dragnet,\\" and also had a successful collaboration with singer Tom Jones in 1988, covering Prince's \\"Kiss.\\" However, their following album \\"Below the Waste\\" in 1989 did not achieve significant success.

Israel frees Palestinian prisoners Gov't committee approves release of 26 Palestinian prisoners Give the answer on a scale from 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\".","completion":"On a scale from 0 to 5, these sentences could be ranked around a 4. They both deal with the subject of the release of Palestinian prisoners. However, they provide different layers of detail and context, which suggests some degree of dissimilarity. The first sentence, \\"Israel frees Palestinian prisoners,\\" is a straightforward, brief statement. It tells us that Israel is the agent directly performing the action, which is freeing Palestinian prisoners. However, it lacks detail on how many prisoners were released, when the release happened, and who specifically made the decision within the Israeli government. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Gov't committee approves release of 26 Palestinian prisoners,\\" offers more specificity. It identifies a specific branch within the Israeli government (a government committee) as the agent that approves the action, not necessarily the one who carries it out directly. It also quantifies the prisoners with the number 26, adding more context to the substance of the action. The difference in the level of detail suggests a slight dissimilarity between the two sentences. So, while they broadly convey the same action (the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel), the details in the second sentence add nuance to the message. Therefore, they cannot be considered to mean exactly the same thing. Generally, the first sentence can be seen as a summary or simplified version of the second sentence, but without knowing the exact number of prisoners or the decision-making body, the full context is not exactly the same. In a nutshell, although both sentences speak about the same general topic, they provide different amounts of information surrounding the event. Hence, the level of similarity could be considered high, but not absolute, allowing room for the nuance and additional context provided in the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: If bicep contraction occurs when fibers get shorter, then what gets contracted when fibers get shorter? Answer choices: - nerves - h2o - veins - firm hugs - fur - biceps - the skin - density Answer:","completion":"When muscle fibers get shorter, it is the muscle itself that contracts. In the context of the question, bicep contraction refers to the shortening of muscle fibers within the bicep muscle, which leads to the overall contraction of the bicep muscle as a whole. Muscle fibers are made up of myofibrils, which contain actin and myosin filaments. These filaments slide past one another during muscle contraction. This process, known as the sliding filament theory, describes how actin filaments slide inward on myosin filaments. When this sliding occurs, the overall length of the muscle fibers decreases, resulting in the contraction of the muscle belly. In summary, when muscle fibers get shorter, it is the muscle itself, specifically the bicep in this case, that contracts. Among the answer choices, \\"biceps\\" is the most accurate response. The other options such as nerves, H2O, veins, firm hugs, fur, the skin, and density are not directly related to muscle contraction or the shortening of muscle fibers, making them incorrect or irrelevant choices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Soldier Context: Renegade KGB agents hijack a plutonium shipment inside the United States and use it to plant a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson). Meanwhile, the president authorizes military action against Israel. Given the unpleasant options of the KGB destroying a large part of the world's oil supply or the United States having to invoke a military response to force Israel to remove its settlements from the West Bank, the title character decides to take a third option. His team infiltrates and captures a US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas, and obtains independent launch capability. As the American military launches their air strikes toward Israel, The Soldier and Susan break into East Berlin by launching their car over the Berlin Wall, confronting the KGB agents and informing them that if their nuke in Saudi Arabia is detonated, his team in Smith Center will nuke Moscow. This forces the... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Soldier,\\" the team captures a US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas. The Soldier (Ken Wahl) and his team take over the silo to gain independent launch capability as a strategic move to prevent a severe global oil crisis and an impending war between the United States and Israel. This decision is made considering the two unfavorable options presented - either allowing the KGB to destroy a significant portion of the world's oil supply or having the United States resort to military action against Israel to force the removal of its settlements from the West Bank. Taking control of the missile silo in Kansas proves to be a strong bargaining chip for The Soldier. As the American military begins launching air strikes towards Israel, The Soldier and Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson), the Israeli Mossad's director of covert operations, infiltrate East Berlin by launching their car over the Berlin Wall. They confront the KGB agents and issue an ultimatum - if the KGB detonates their nuclear device in Saudi Arabia, The Soldier's team in Smith Center will launch a nuclear missile at Moscow. This high-stakes move effectively forces the KGB to disarm their nuclear device planted in the Saudi Arabian oilfield, thus saving the world from the potential oil crisis and a devastating war between the United States and Israel. The Soldier's unconventional approach and the capture of the US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas, become crucial turning points in addressing the crisis and resolving the conflict in the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The men get stoned/drunk, and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene. The women are superfluous to the story  I do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus, or worse, milling around like mesmerized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks. It's the standard knocked-up girlfriend, her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before. Every character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower! And the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with George Wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag!

Possible A: loading dock, construction site, supermarket, construction yard, warehouse Why is \\"warehouse\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Warehouse\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons: 1. Warehouses typically store large quantities of goods and products that need to be organized and placed onto shelves. 2. Forklifts are designed to lift and transport heavy and bulk items, which can easily be found in warehouses. The use of a forklift enables efficient and safe handling of these items, reducing the risk of injury or damage to workers. 3. Warehouses often have high shelves to optimize storage space. Forklifts are equipped to reach and stack boxes up onto those high shelves, making them a practical tool for use in a warehouse. 4. In warehouses, there's usually a need for efficient and quick movement and placement of items, as warehouses deal with a constant flow of inventory. Forklifts can fulfill this need by facilitating easy transportation and stacking of goods, thus ensuring smooth operations at a warehouse. 5. Warehouses often have large, open spaces with suitable flooring for forklifts to operate. This makes it easy for forklift operators to navigate and perform their tasks. While the other options (loading dock, construction site, supermarket, and construction yard) may also have scenarios where forklifts can be used, the most common and logical place to use a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves based on human common sense would be a warehouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Sumerians were a non-Semitic caucasoid people, and spoke a language isolate; a number of linguists believed they could detect a substrate language beneath Sumerian, because names of some of Sumer's major cities are not Sumerian, revealing influences of earlier inhabitants. However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the early Ubaid period (5300 – 4700 BC C-14) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. Why were the lands in the region the Sumerian people settled fertile?","completion":"The lands in the region where the Sumerian people settled were fertile due to the silt deposited by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These rivers carried nutrient-rich silt from the mountains and highlands, and as the rivers overflowed their banks during seasonal flooding, the silt was deposited onto the surrounding lands. This layer of silt replenished the soil with essential nutrients, providing the necessary conditions for agriculture and enabling the Sumerians to cultivate a variety of crops.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these questions are not the same. They address two separate concerns: 1) making someone lose interest in a romantic interest, and 2) maintaining friendships without causing others to lose interest. I will provide detailed answers to both questions. 1. How do I make my friend lose interest in a girl? Making your friend lose interest in a girl might not be the best approach, as it involves manipulation and could have negative consequences on your friendship. However, if you genuinely believe that it is in their best interest to reconsider their feelings, consider the following strategies: a) Highlight Incompatibilities: Emphasize the differences and incompatibilities between your friend and the girl, focusing on their values, habits, and lifestyles. Offer constructive examples to provide context. b) Share Alternatives: Introduce your friend to new people and create situations where they can interact with others who might be better suited for them. By widening their social circle, your friend may naturally lose interest in the girl. c) Offer Support and Encouragement: Be a good listener and encourage your friend to share their feelings. Fostering an open, empathetic dialogue can enable your friend to build self-awareness, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their relationships. d) Avoid Badmouthing: Refrain from speaking negatively about the girl, as this could trigger a defensive response and harm your friendship. Instead, maintain a respectful and balanced perspective. 2. How do I keep people from losing interest in being friends with me? To maintain strong and long-lasting friendships, follow these guidelines: a) Be Genuinely Interested: Show genuine interest in others' lives by asking questions, checking on their well-being, and remembering important milestones. b) Be a Positive Presence: Remain positive and uplifting, as people gravitate towards those who make them feel good. Avoid constant negativity, as it can become draining over time. c) Engage in Shared Activities: Participate in mutual hobbies, projects, or events to create fun, memorable experiences, and strengthen your bond. d) Communicate Regularly: Conversation fosters connection. Maintain regular communication, whether in person, through texting, or social media, to keep connected. e) Offer Help and Support: Be available to listen, encourage, and help when your friends need it. Reciprocal support is crucial for a strong, enduring friendship. f) Be Trustworthy: Show loyalty, honesty, and reliability to gain their trust. Avoid sharing their secrets or gossiping about them. g) Respect Boundaries: Understand and respect personal and emotional boundaries, allowing your friendship to flourish without pressure or discomfort. h) Showcase Personal Growth: Continue to evolve and grow as a person, so your friends are consistently inspired and motivated by your presence. By focusing on these guidelines and maintaining authentic, positive relationships, you can ensure that your friends remain interested in being a part of your life.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Before you use the banana peel, you want to make sure that your skin is free from dirt and oils. Use a mild cleanser to clean the affected area, then rinse with cool water. Pat the skin dry with a soft clean towel. Don't scrub or rub your skin too harshly. This will inflame your skin and could make acne worse. You'll want to pick out a banana that is ripe. It should be yellow with black spots. Avoid bananas that are under-ripe (bright yellow with green tips) or over-ripe (greasy and black). Using a ripe banana will also make it easier to wipe over the acne-affected area. Remove the banana from its peel. You won't need to use it to treat acne, so eat it or save it for treating another skin issue. Cut the peel so that it's easy to hold a chunk in your hand. Banana peels contain vitamins A, B, C, E, and contain potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese. These nutrients can calm inflamed skin and and reduce acne outbreaks. Use the interior part of the peel that appears white. Take the chunk of banana peel and gently rub or massage your skin with it for about 10 minutes. Every few minutes, you should check to see if the peel is still white inside. Once it's turned black, replace it with another piece and continue massaging your skin. Don't immediately wash your face once you've finished massaging it with the banana peel. If you can, wait until the end of the day to rinse your skin off with cool water. This will allow your skin to absorb the banana peel's nutrients. If you can't wait until the end of the day to wash your face, try rubbing the peel on your face before you go to bed. In the morning, rinse your face with clean water. While you only need to rub your face with the banana peel once during the day, you should do this for several days in a row. After a few days, you may notice your acne begin to clear up or at least appear less red. If you notice your skin becomes extremely irritated after using the banana peel, stop using it and give your skin a chance to rest. Consider seeing a dermatologist if your acne continues or gets worse.","completion":"Clean your skin, gently rub a ripe banana peel on your acne for 10 minutes, and do this for several days to help reduce redness and outbreaks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

That is a small fraction of the roughly 4.3 million total births that year.

Choices: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(2). Yes A visitor can have a baby in the United States, although it is of vital importance to understand the legal and financial implications associated with birth tourism. The concept of birth tourism refers to the practice of traveling to another country, typically the United States, for the purpose of giving birth to a child who will automatically acquire citizenship upon birth, as per the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This child would gain certain benefits and opportunities as a U.S. citizen, such as access to public education, travel, and the potential to sponsor their parents for a green card at the age of 21. While it is not illegal for visitors to give birth in the United States, the circumstances and conditions under which they enter can have legal implications. If a visitor obtains a visa on false pretenses, this could result in visa fraud, and subsequently, they may face denial of entry, deportation, or other legal repercussions. Time is another factor to be aware of, as visitors may enter the U.S. via a tourist visa (B-1 or B-2 visa) or the Visa Waiver Program (ESTA), which typically allow stays of up to six months, depending on the country of origin. Planning for the birth and ensuring that visa expiration dates do not lapse is crucial. It is essential for visitors seeking to have a baby in the U.S. to be prepared and aware of the financial costs associated with childbirth. Health insurance is critical to cover the costs of prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care, which can be quite expensive, particularly for people without insurance. Visitors should also be mindful of additional expenses, such as accommodation and daily living expenses, incurred during their stay. In conclusion, while a visitor can have a baby in the United States, it is crucial to plan carefully, obtain appropriate legal documentation, have health insurance, and consider the financial implications involved in order to ensure a safe and successful birth experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Wildest Dream Context: In 1924 mountaineer George Mallory was torn between love for his wife Ruth, and his obsession with the last great adventure left to man: becoming the first person to reach the summit of the untouched Mount Everest. Dressed in gabardine and wearing hobnailed boots, Mallory risked everything in pursuit of his dream, but was last seen alive 800 feet below the summit. Then the clouds rolled in and he disappeared. After discovering Malloryâs body on Everest in 1999, modern climber Conrad Ankerâs life became intertwined with Malloryâs story. Malloryâs frozen body was found with his belongings intact; the only thing missing was a photograph of Ruth, which Mallory had promised to place on the summit. Haunted by Mallory's story, Anker returns to Everest with British climbing prodigy Leo Houlding to discover the truth about Mallory and to unravel the mysteries surrounding his disappearance. Anker and his climbing partner take on the Second Step without the use of the fixed ladder; free climbing it with the use of some modern safety precautions (e.g. perlon rope, camming devices, belay devices), to evaluate if indeed Mallory was capable of climbing the Second Step himself in 1924. A:","completion":"In the context of the movie \\"The Wildest Dream,\\" the life of modern climber Conrad Anker became intertwined with that of George Mallory, a mountaineer from the 1920s who was obsessed with becoming the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. This historical connection between Anker and Mallory was sparked by Anker's discovery of Mallory's body on Everest in 1999, which had been missing since Mallory's ill-fated attempt to reach the summit in 1924. Mallory's story was one of a man torn between his love for his wife, Ruth, and his desire to conquer the world's tallest mountain. Dressed in gabardine and hobnailed boots, Mallory was last seen alive just 800 feet below the summit before he disappeared in the clouds. Upon finding Mallory's frozen body, intact with all his belongings except for a photograph of Ruth, Anker became fascinated with uncovering the truth about Mallory's final moments and the mystery of his disappearance. Haunted by Mallory's story, Conrad Anker returned to Everest with British climbing prodigy Leo Houlding to investigate Mallory's fate and to determine whether Mallory could have potentially reached the summit before his untimely death. To do this, Anker and Houlding attempted to climb the Second Step, a crucial part of Everest's summit route, without the use of a fixed ladder (which was not available to Mallory in 1924). They utilized modern safety precautions, such as perlon rope, camming devices, and belay devices, to assess whether it would have been possible for Mallory to complete the climb using the equipment available to him at the time. By recreating Mallory's potential journey and immersing himself in the climbing conditions Mallory faced, Conrad Anker's life became intimately connected with that of George Mallory. Through his exploration of Mallory's story and his own climbing experiences, Anker sought to better understand the man who was driven by the wildest dream of scaling Mount Everest and unravel the mysteries surrounding Mallory's disappearance. This experience ultimately led to a deeper connection between Anker and Mallory, intertwining their lives through the shared pursuit of human achievement and adventure on Earth's highest peak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! What does the writer want to tell us? A) Kindness in our lives can help us grow.

Ten days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five-and-a-half hours of coverage. To think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympic Games in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans didn't even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four-and-a-half years ago I was like most Americans and didn't know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I didn't so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann. Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices. I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? How many households are aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the Games, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You couldn't turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. So it is a weird feeling being back home. Four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four-and-a-half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 Games. Overcoming adversity. I will be honest, coming home from London isn't what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the Games' most successful athlete; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. As I got on the plane to return to Minnesota I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. What I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the ups and the downs, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four-and-a-half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. We have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they don't go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life doesn't go according to a plan. We can map it out, we can plan it, we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. My life this past month had a plan of its own. It didn't matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it didn't matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close the plan I had envisioned wasn't the plan that life had for me. Bubble. Over these past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was reclassified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. As I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do different next time. What can I change in my preparations over these next four years before the Rio 2016 Games? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. We were away from the real world in many ways. We didn't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was. Most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phones didn't work internationally. But then we return home and real life hits. You no longer are completely focused on competition; you are no longer surrounded by other athletes in the bubble. You are home.

Question: who becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence? Movie title: Solaris Movie plot: Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Solaris, it is ultimately Kris Kelvin's wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who becomes independent and able to exist away from Kelvin's presence. Hari is a manifestation created by the planet Solaris based on Kelvin's memories. Initially, she relies entirely on Kelvin's presence and does not have the ability to exist separately from him. However, throughout the film, Hari gains independence and self-awareness. She ultimately chooses to die and be \\"reborn\\" by the planet's ocean, leaving Kelvin behind and becoming capable of existing without him."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the given scenario, the 22-month-old child is going through a phase where he does not want to sleep alone and insists on sleeping on top of his mother. However, his mother is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with this situation as her belly is getting too big, most likely due to pregnancy, and she needs to get proper sleep as well. Throughout the night, the child cries loudly when he is placed back in his own room, often leading to vomiting. This makes the mother unhappy because she is concerned for the well-being of both her child and herself, and she struggles to find a solution that can help soothe the child and enable both of them to get the much-needed rest. None of the other options provided seem to contribute to the mother's unhappiness in this particular situation, as the main issue involves the child's insistence on sleeping on top of his mother, and the subsequent crying when his request is not granted.

Let's do the subtraction: (701 - 686) * r This is the same as: 15 * r So our new equation would be: -30 = 15 * r Now we need to find the value of 'r'. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 15. -30 ÷ 15 = 15 * r ÷ 15 This gives us: -2 = r So the value of 'r' is -2.

What is the first and last name of the person whose Greek origin is referenced in his nickname? Answer the above question based on the context below: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.
