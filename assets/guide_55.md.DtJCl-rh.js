What is the final step of the following process: - Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes The answer to this question is:","completion":"The final step of the process involving the formation of igneous rocks, which begins with the cooling of magma inside the Earth's crust, the crystallization of magma, the cooling of lava on the Earth's surface, and the crystallization of lava, is the formation and integration of these newly formed igneous rocks into the rock cycle. Igneous rocks, derived from the cooling and crystallization of both magma and lava, are classified into two main types: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma cools and crystallizes within the Earth's crust. On the other hand, extrusive igneous rocks form when lava cools and crystallizes on the Earth's surface. These rocks have distinct textures and mineral compositions based on their cooling rates and chemical compositions. After these igneous rocks have formed, they undergo various processes as part of the rock cycle, including weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and metamorphism. Over time, igneous rocks gradually break down due to weathering and erosion agents such as water, ice, wind, and biologic activity. As they break down, they become small fragments or sediments, which are transported and eventually deposited by natural processes like water or wind. In turn, these sediments accumulate in layers, becoming compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks. Through the dynamic processes of the Earth, these sedimentary rocks can eventually be buried deep within the Earth's crust, subjecting them to extreme heat and pressure, which causes them to metamorphose into metamorphic rocks. If the metamorphic rocks experience even further heating, they may melt and return to the state of magma, effectively starting the whole process over again. In conclusion, the final step of the process involving the cooling and crystallization of magma and lava is the formation of igneous rocks and their integration into the rock cycle. These rocks can then be transformed into other rock types or even be recycled back into magma through the continuous processes of weathering, sedimentation, metamorphism, and melting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that got a £10,000 grant?, using the article: Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated \\"Yamacraw Island\\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\". He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \\"the river.\\" As a result, he's fired. As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge. As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This film was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia and used pupils from C.B. Greer Elementary school as the cast of students.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... and the situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Answer the following question: Would item B have higher or lower specific gravity than item A?

Step 1: Understand the nephron structure The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood, removing waste products, and reabsorbing useful substances. It consists of a renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowman's capsule), the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct system. Step 2: Identify the part responsible for glucose reabsorption The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for most of the reabsorption of useful substances in the nephron. The cells lining the PCT have microvilli, which increase the surface area available for reabsorption. Step 3: Understand glucose reabsorption mechanism In the PCT, glucose is reabsorbed through a process called secondary active transport. Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) on the cell membrane of PCT cells transport glucose and sodium from the tubular fluid into the cell. This process uses the energy stored in the concentration gradient of sodium ions established by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane of tubular cells. After glucose enters the cell, it moves into the interstitial fluid and eventually into the peritubular capillaries through facilitated diffusion via GLUT transporters. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the analysis of the nephron structure and the mechanism of glucose reabsorption, it is concluded that glucose gets reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the nephron."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - panic - deadlines - accomplishing - momentum - sitting down The rationale to choose \\"panic\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Starting work after it is too late can lead to panic for several reasons. When a person begins to work late, they might feel overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done in a short period of time. This sense of urgency and time pressure can result in heightened stress, anxiety, and ultimately, panic. Panic in this context refers to a sudden feeling of extreme anxiety and fear, which can be counterproductive and impair the ability to focus and make rational decisions. Moreover, panic can reduce the overall effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the work being done. While other choices may have some relation to beginning work late, none captures the potential consequences as accurately as \\"panic\\": - Deadlines: Although working late might be the result of approaching deadlines, it does not necessarily have to lead to panic, if managed effectively. - Accomplishing: It is possible to accomplish tasks even after starting late, but it may require extra effort or sacrifice in other areas of life. - Momentum: Building momentum could be challenging when starting work late, but not all late starts result in the failure to establish momentum. - Sitting down: This choice is unrelated to the consequences of beginning work late, as sitting down is just a description of the physical act of getting to work. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"panic\\" as the answer is that beginning work after it is too late can significantly increase stress levels, leading to feelings of panic and potentially hindering the overall quality and efficiency of the work being performed.

Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as Vorbis and MP3. Compression ratios are around 50–60% of original size, which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like FLAC, Shorten and TTA use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser B. use just water to cleanse C. use abrasive soap D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sock might be among the items around your baby, but without more information, we cannot definitively say that the sock is in the middle along with your baby. 2) Figurative interpretation: If the phrase \\"In the middle of it all\\" refers to a complex or chaotic situation, the baby could be the focus of the situation or serve as the reason for everything happening around them. In such a case, mentioning the sock does not seem relevant to the statement. The idea that \\"My sock was in the middle of it\\" would not follow in this interpretation because it does not connect to the main emphasis on the baby or the situation. Ultimately, the statement \\"My sock was in the middle of it\\" does not necessarily follow from the initial statement without more context or a clear connection to the baby being at the center. It is crucial to understand the circumstances and the relationship between the baby, the sock, and the situation described in \\"the middle of it all\\" before drawing a conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To do this, we need to analyze the situation and choose one option from the given choices. Step 1: Understanding the situation Addison told Cameron they were an idiot when Cameron performed poorly at a presentation. This could imply that Addison is frustrated or disappointed in Cameron's performance and may feel the need to take action as a result. Step 2: Evaluating the potential responses a) \\"Get a new office for Cameron\\" - This option does not seem to appropriately address the situation, as moving Cameron to a new office may not improve their abilities or skills. b) \\"Find a replacement for Cameron\\" - Depending on the severity of the poor performance and its potential impact on the team, finding a replacement for Cameron might be a more plausible solution for Addison if they believe Cameron cannot handle their responsibilities. c) \\"Stop being friends with Addison\\" - This option seems less likely, as the statement doesn't specify their personal relationship or that their disagreement would impact the friendship. Step 3: Choosing the most likely response Based on Addison's reaction to Cameron's performance, the most likely response would be: Answer: Find a replacement for Cameron It is important to note that this is only a prediction based on the information provided and the potential consequences that Addison may consider.

Write an article based on this \\"Two of England's last deep coal mines are to close after they were refused further government funding.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Closing of England's Last Deep Coal Mines: A Sign of Changing Times Introduction In recent years, many countries around the world have embarked on their journey towards environmental awareness and cleaner sources of energy. As a result, the focus on non-renewable resources, particularly coal, has diminished as governments turn towards alternative energy solutions. In England, a prime example of this shift can be witnessed in the closing of two of the country's last deep coal mines – Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery – which were refused further government funding. This article delves into the history of these mines, explores the reasons behind the decision to stop funding, and discusses the potential implications for the industry, affected communities, and the future of energy production in England. History of Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery Kellingley Colliery, situated in North Yorkshire, started its operations in 1965 and quickly became one of the largest coal mines in Europe. At its peak, Kellingley employed over 2,000 miners and produced more than 900,000 tonnes of coal annually. Similarly, Thoresby Colliery, located in Nottinghamshire, began its operations in 1925. Like Kellingley, Thoresby Colliery also had a strong workforce and played a significant role in England's coal production. Both Kellingley and Thoresby mines experienced coal mining accidents in their lifetime, with the loss of lives highlighting the dangers coal miners faced daily. Over the years, the demand for coal in the United Kingdom decreased due to a range of factors, including economic and environmental reasons. Reasons Behind the Decision to Stop Funding The United Kingdom's government has voiced a commitment to focusing on clean energy and reducing carbon emissions. In the mid-2010s, the UK government developed a comprehensive energy strategy to eliminate coal power plants from the country's energy landscape. The essence of this plan has led to the emergence of alternative energy projects that reduce reliance on fossil fuels, including coal. Furthermore, the government's refusal to provide further funding to the Kellingley and Thoresby mines is underpinned by the fact that the cost of maintaining deep coal mines far outweighs the benefits. The low global coal price has rendered deep coal mining lessens profitable, making it economically infeasible for the government to invest in maintaining these mines. Additionally, the rise in renewable energy significantly contributed to the diminished need for coal and, consequently, the closure of these mines. Implications for the Industry, Affected Communities, and the Future of Energy Production The closure of these mines represents a turning point in the history of England's energy production. While coal had played an essential role in England's energy consumption for centuries, the move towards renewable energy marks a pivotal change toward a sustainable energy future. The closure of Kellingley and Thoresby mines will have profound social and economic implications for the local communities. With the mines' closure, many miners have lost their jobs and sources of income, and these two regions now face the challenge of adapting to new industries and training the workforce for new employment opportunities. In terms of energy production, the closing of the last deep coal mines is indicative of the transition towards a future dominated by sustainable energy sources. Wind, solar, and tidal power are increasingly taking center stage, with the UK aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Conclusion The closing of Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery symbolizes a significant chapter in England's energy history. Through this decision, the government has shown its commitment to a sustainable future free from coal dependency. While the transition presents challenges for local communities and the economy, it also ushers in a new era of sustainable energy production, propelling England forward in its quest for a greener, cleaner, and more environmentally responsible nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Today we have the second report explaining how to prepare fish by drying or smoking them. We talked last week about the first steps of cleaning and salting freshly caught fish. To dry fish, you will need either a drying table or a place to hang them. If a table is used, it should have a top made of wire screen or thin pieces of wood with space between each piece. Lay the cleaned, wet salted fish on top of the table. Do not let them touch each other. Be sure that air can reach the fish from all sides. _ Turn the fish over every other day. Small fish will dry in about three days if the air is dry. Large fish will take a week or ten days to dry. After the fish have dried, place them in a basket. Cover them with clean paper or large leaves. Then put the basket in a cool, dry place off the ground. Make sure as much of the saltwater as possible is removed before you smoke the fish. The smoking can be done in a large, round metal container. Remove the top of the drum and cut a small opening on one side at the bottom. Cover the top with a strong wire screen, where you put the fish. Build a small fire in the drum by reaching in through the opening at the bottom. Wood from fruit trees makes good fuel for your fire. _ will give the smoked fish good color1 and taste. One way to get a lot of smoke is to use green wood, not dried wood. You should smoke the fish for five days or longer if you plan to keep them for a long time. After that, wrap them in clean paper, put the fish in baskets and keep them in a cool, dry place off the ground.

Posteriormente, obtenemos el radical del verbo en español y procedemos a conjugarlo según la información contextual, como el sujeto, el tiempo, el modo, el aspecto, la voz y el número. Algunos ejemplos de equivalencias entre infinitivos en inglés y en español son: 1. To work → Trabajar 2. To see → Ver 3. To know → Saber or Conocer (dependiendo del contexto) Una vez que tengamos el infinitivo en español, podemos obtener el radical y conjugarlo apropiadamente. Por ejemplo, para el verbo \\"trabajar\\" (to work), el radical es \\"trabaj-\\" y se puede conjugar de la siguiente manera: Yo trabajo (I work) Tú trabajas (You work) Él/ella/usted trabaja (He/she/you(formal) work) Nosotros/nosotras trabajamos (We work) Vosotros/vosotras trabajáis (You all work) Ellos/ellas/ustedes trabajan (They/you all work) El proceso es similar para otros verbos regulares en español, mientras que los verbos irregulares pueden tener cambios en el radical o en las terminaciones durante la conjugación. No obstante, el concepto básico de obtener el radical del infinitivo y conjugar el verbo de acuerdo con las reglas gramaticales y el contexto en español sigue siendo el mismo en todos los casos."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Middle Ages In the 13th century mendicant orders—the Franciscans and the Dominicans—who swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging, were approved by the papacy. Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy. In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them. Q: What notable vow was sworn by the mendicant orders?","completion":"The notable vow sworn by the mendicant orders, like the Franciscans and the Dominicans, was the vow of poverty.

Her parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancé and his parents. Jerry happens to hear Giancarlos (Michelangelo's father) beautiful operatic voice while the latter sings in the shower. As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring Giancarlos gift to the public. Although Giancarlo protests that he sings for himself and doesnt want to go professional, Jerry pushes the issue until Giancarlo agrees to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs. Outside the safety of his shower, Giancarlos confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In Giancarlos case, he performs best in his shower. Giancarlo, naked but for a towel, premieres at the Teatro dellOpera di Roma. Jerry has built him a shower onstage, and Giancarlo sings as he washes. The opera attendees love his strange performance, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage Pagliacci, shower and all. Again, Giancarlos rich voice mesmerizes the crowd, and he receives rave reviews though Jerry's direction is once again utterly reviled, a fact he is not aware of since he doesn't understand Italian. Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family though he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing Pagliacci.Newlyweds Antonio and Milly move from their rustic hometown to Rome because Antonios posh uncles have offered him a job in their familys business.

Paragraph: You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily. Question: \\"What is friction?\\" Answer: \\"Friction causes molecules to move faster in order to create heat energy\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPT: [1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"[1]. no The answer \\"Friction causes molecules to move faster in order to create heat energy\\" is not the correct definition of friction. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? It is important the more you eat, the more careful you to be.","completion":"The given sentence is not syntactically and semantically acceptable as it contains some grammatical errors and a lack of coherence in conveying the intended meaning. A syntactically and semantically acceptable version of the sentence could be: \\"It is important that the more you eat, the more careful you need to be.\\" Here's a breakdown of the changes made to the original sentence to create a more structurally and contextually accurate version: 1. Adding \\"that\\" after \\"important.\\" In the original sentence, the term \\"important\\" acts as an adjective and should be followed by the conjunction \\"that\\" to establish a clear connection between the independent clause (\\"It is important\\") and the dependent clause that provides further detail about what is important. 2. Replacing \\"you to be\\" with \\"you need to be.\\" The original sentence appears to be missing a verb, which is essential for forming a complete thought. By including \\"need\\" in the sentence, we establish an imperative tone that explains what the subject, \\"you\\", should do. It also clarifies the intended message that caution is necessary when consuming larger quantities of food. 3. Maintaining parallelism. Parallelism is a grammatical principle stating that elements in a sentence with similar functions should be structured the same way. In this case, the sentence contains a correlative conjunction \\"the more...the more,\\" which serves to emphasize the proportional relationship between eating and being careful. To maintain parallelism, it is essential to use the same construction in both parts of the conjunction: \\"The more you eat, the more careful you need to be.\\" By implementing these changes, we create a sentence that is syntactically and semantically acceptable, effectively conveying the idea that increased food consumption warrants more caution."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

From popping a champagne cork to appearing to take part in magic tricks, the wild squirrels captured in these images are gently coaxed into their eccentric positions using a variety of toys and food treats. Photographer Max Ellis, 51, says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance in his garden in Teddington, south west London before he is able to capture his image. Heavy lifting: This squirrel appears to be pumping iron, but is actually gathering sunflower seeds that have been strategically placed on a dumbbell suspended in the air using a fishing line. Photographer Max Ellis says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take the right stance. Ouch! This inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo. Mr Ellis, said the fact squirrels are really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them. In one scene an inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo, while in another it appears to be lifting weights. Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'The fact they’re really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them. 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience,' he added. 'I’m experimenting with more elaborate props and new ideas come to me daily. They constantly surprise me with their intelligence and dexterity so its great fun coming up with new ideas. Talent: Mr Ellis said he came up with idea to crate hilarious photographs using wild squirrels after watching professional magicians with his 11-year-old son Guliver on YouTube last December. Caught on film: After the magic scene images started getting attention online, Mr Ellis decided to try to create a few more photographs using the squirrels. Inquisitive: Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience' Mr Ellis, 51, took the photographs after trying to work out new ways to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver. He said he initially came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube last December. He said: 'My son is very keen on magic so I thought it might be fun to see if I could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick.' 'It did take quite a while to set up as I wanted it to look realistic. I thought The Great Squirrelisimo was a nice stage name.' Calm: The inquisitive squirrel sneaks up behind the Buckaroo toy. Although he doesn't know it yet, the squirrel is in for quite a surprise. Fear: As the Buckaroo toy started to kick, the terrified squirrel jumped from the table to get away as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed. 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed. Flee: The squirrel seemed to want to get away from the toy as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis uses an incredibly fast shutter speed on his camera to catch the action. After the magic scene images started getting attention online, Mr Ellis decided to try to create a few more photographs using the squirrels. 'For the weightlifting shots I had a few weights lying around and wondered if the squirrels would check them out,' he said.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - Ernie Manouse ( born September 1 , 1969 , in Binghamton , New York ) is an American television host , radio personality , writer and producer . He currently hosts the interview show InnerVIEWS with Ernie Manouse , produced by HoustonPBS . His work with HoustonPBS has met critical acclaim in the southern United States , earning him numerous KATIE awards and regional Emmy Awards - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Binghamton is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States. It lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people. The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376. - The Southern Tier is the counties of New York west of the Catskill Mountains along the northern border of Pennsylvania. It generally includes the counties that border Pennsylvania west of Delaware County, but definitions of the region vary widely. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - The Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area, also called Greater Binghamton or the Triple Cities, is a region of southern upstate New York in the Northeastern United States, anchored by the city of Binghamton. The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties, which together had a population of 251,725 as of the 2010 census. From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NYPA Urban Area. In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well.

Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don't know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don't watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why don't we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending \\"falling while running away\\" trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams \\"Noooo\\" like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character wasn't so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn't read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn't look real at all) I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I would break it down into key points and evaluate whether each point has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment: 1. The movie seemed promising in the beginning, with some bright moments: Positive 2. Some parts felt fresh and unique: Positive 3. The rest of the movie is not so good, laughable at times: Negative 4. The movie is slow-paced and sometimes boring: Negative 5. Characters are not great, with some being undeveloped and not believable: Negative 6. Women in horror movies lack intelligence: Negative 7.

Based on this breakdown, I would say that the overall sentiment of the review is Negative.

On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who topples a bust onto their own head?, using the article: In 1917, Stan and Ollie are drafted into the American Expeditionary Force to fight in World War I. Their ineptitude during basic training antagonizes the drill sergeant and they are assigned to kitchen duties. They misunderstand the cook's instructions and empty the garbage cans into the general's private dining room. The cook, who is thrown in the stockade with them, curses their \\"snitching\\" and threatens them with violence after they are released. They escape his wrath when they are shipped to the trenches in France. Serving close to the front line, they befriend soldier Eddie Smith, who receives a Dear John letter from his wife. When Eddie is killed in action, the boys determine to rescue Eddie's daughter from her brutal foster father and deliver her to Eddie's parents. They distinguish themselves in combat by losing control of a tank and accidentally forcing a German platoon into the open. After the Armistice, Stan and Ollie venture to New York City to retrieve the girl and look for Eddie's parents. Using the city telephone directory, the task proves both monumental and problematic as the boys blindly attempt to visit each Smith until they find the grandparents. After taking punches from an annoyed prizefighter and disrupting a society wedding, they resort to telephoning first. While operating their lunch wagon, the boys are approached by an unpleasant civil servant who demands Eddie's child so that she can be placed in an orphanage. The boys refuse, and the man says he will return with the police to have the boys arrested.

A property on Thelwall Avenue in Fallowfield, Manchester is being searched as part of the investigation. Twenty-two people were killed by suicide bomber Salman Abedi after an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Police forensics teams have taken photos of the inside of the housing association property and the contents of the bins outside. A young man and a woman, covering their faces, were led away by plain clothes detectives and taken away in an unmarked car. Neighbours said a Libyan family has been living at the address for a number of years - a mother, two sons and a daughter, though the father is believed to be in Libya. Ali Mohamed, visiting a friend at a house across the road, said: \\"I saw Salman Abedi here. He didn't show any danger or anything bad. He just seemed like a normal kid.\\" It is understood the arrested man was on an inbound flight to the UK when he was held at the airport.

Question: What country is Christopher traveling through? Title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth.

Article: Thousands of protesters have gathered outside a Barcelona court as the former head of the eastern Spanish region of Catalonia, Artur Mas, went on trial for staging an informal independence referendum. Shouting \\"Independence, independence\\", \\"Down with Spain's justice system\\" and \\"We want to vote,\\" some 40,000 people on Monday turned up at the court, many of whom held separatist red and yellow flags. Catalonia is home to a strong separatist movement and pro-independence campaigners held a vote in 2014 on whether to break away from Spain while Mas was regional governor. The poll was carried out without legal backing because the central Spanish government blocked it in the courts, saying it was against the constitution. The symbolic ballot was manned by volunteers to get around the restrictions. More than 80.8 percent of those who cast their ballot in the 2014 vote did so for independence - although only 2.3 million people out of a total of 6.3 million eligible voters took part. Mas, who stepped down as leader last year, stands accused of disobedience against the state and wrong-doing as a public official. He could face a 10-year ban from public office if found guilty. But Mas' defence lawyers argue that by agreeing to an unofficial vote in 2014, the Catalan administration was merely defending \\"the right to freedom of expression\\" of Catalans, many of whom want a say in the future of their 7.5 million-strong region. \\"Independence isn't on trial here, democracy is on trial,\\" Mas told journalists in the court. \\"It's the first time that a democratic government is tried for having allowed people to vote. It's an unprecedented moment.\\" \\"Today, many of us feel as if we're being tried,\\" current regional head Carles Puigdemont added outside the court. 'Proof of Spain's rule of law' But Alfonso Dastis, Spain's foreign minister, retorted that the trial was merely a proof of the \\"rule of law\\" in Spain. \\"What is on trial is an act that failed to acknowledge a Constitutional Court sentence, nothing more,\\" he said from Brussels, where he is attending a meeting OPINION: Catalonia's declaration of independence The trial comes at a time of high tension between Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's minority government in the capital, Madrid, and Catalonia's local separatist administration. Catalonia's current government has promised to hold an independence referendum in September - a binding one this time, with or without Madrid's consent. But how exactly it will go ahead is unclear, as Rajoy's conservative government insists that this type of local, one-region-only referendum is unconstitutional, and has vowed never to allow an act that would risk the unity of Spain. Last week, reports emerged in several national dailies that Madrid was considering drastic measures to stop a vote, such as closing schools where polling booths could be set up or taking control of the police, which is normally managed by regional authorities. The government neither confirmed nor denied the reports. Rajoy has given his deputy prime minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the task of starting regular talks with Catalan authorities, but so far these have not yielded any results. The Catalans themselves remain divided over the issue - 44.9 percent want independence while 45.1 percent are against it, according to a recent poll conducted by a Catalan public institute. A large majority, however, wants a referendum. ||||| BARCELONA — Around 40,000 people took to the streets of Barcelona Monday ahead of the start of the trial of former Catalan president Artur Mas and two members of his cabinet, who are accused of organizing an illegal vote on independence from Spain in 2014. In a carefully organized show of force, the defendants walked from the headquarters of the regional government to the courthouse accompanied by members of the current Catalan cabinet. Thousands of supporters made their voices heard, shouting “independence” and “you are not alone” and waving pro-independence banners. “Thank you for your support, affection, convictions, ideals, for always standing up to defend Catalonia,” Mas told the crowd in a short statement after an initial court hearing. “Many of us feel that we’re being judged today,” said current Catalan President Carles Puigdemont. “Those responsible for making [the vote] a judicial affair will face a nation that maintains its dignity.” Mas — who faces a 10-year ban from public office if found guilty — assumed full responsibility before the tribunal for instigating the non-binding vote, but denied having intentionally violated the law. He claimed that his government was simply supporting the work of an estimated 42,000 volunteers who organized the vote, which was ruled illegal by the country’s Constitutional Court five days before it was due to take place. Around 2.3 million people — between 36 percent and 42 percent of the electorate, depending on which side’s figures are used — cast a ballot and 80 percent voted for independence. “No one is being judged for his political ideas,” Pablo Casado, a spokesman for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s Popular Party, told reporters in Madrid after the hearing. In Spain, he claimed, “everyone is subject to the rule of law because a democracy without law is not a democracy.” The trial of Mas, his deputy Joana Ortega and his education minister Irene Rigau — which will last five days — comes at a time of extreme tension between Puigdemont’s secessionist cabinet, which has committed to organizing a new referendum on independence (this time a binding one) before October, and Spain’s government led by Rajoy. The conservative PM and the vast majority of Spanish political forces oppose the vote and the self-determination of Catalonia. The government in Madrid has made it clear that it will use all legal means to stop the referendum. Measures could include the seizure of competencies from the Catalan regional government and fresh criminal prosecutions against the current Catalan leaders. Catalan pro-independence forces won 48 percent of the vote and an absolute majority of seats in the regional assembly in 2015 elections. Lawmakers then approved an 18-month roadmap to independence. “We’ll go far as we need to. We have a commitment to make a referendum” — Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras With Madrid and Barcelona in a deadlock, and the deadline set by pro-independence forces approaching, a key factor will be whether current Catalan leaders are prepared to disobey Spanish law and go ahead with their planned referendum. “We’ll go far as we need to,” Catalan vice president Oriol Junqueras told POLITICO. “We have a commitment to make a referendum […] and we’ll comply with the democratic mandate that we have because it’s our duty.” Junqueras is widely expected to become the next president of Catalonia in the next elections, which will likely be called at the end of this year — with or without a referendum. His party, the center-left Catalan Republican Left, leads in the polls over Puigdemont and Mas’ center-right Catalan European Democratic Party, the current coalition partners. Junqueras said a criminal prosecution such as that leveled against Mas, and a potential ban from public office, won’t deter him from going ahead with the referendum. “Those who come after me will surely do it better than me,” he said. Fernando de Páramo, a member of the Catalan parliament for the pro-unity, centrist Ciudadanos, said he believes that the regional government will ultimately call new elections and argued that the separatist leaders have walked into a “labyrinth” from which they don’t know how to get out. |||||Summary:","completion":"Spain's former head of Catalonia, Artur Mas, is on trial for holding an informal independence referendum in 2014 when he was regional governor.

Q:Information: - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished.

Addressing a function organized here by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Anand said, the greatest and most urgent challenges of human rights in India were in the areas of maternal and child care, child education, child labor, child abuse and protection of minorities and weaker sections. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"child labor is a challenge\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the paragraph provided, we can conclude that child labor is a challenge in India. The speaker, Anand, mentions the greatest and most urgent challenges of human rights in India, and lists several areas of concern, one of which is child labor. Let us examine this issue in detail to understand its implications and consequences on India and its population. Child labor refers to the employment of children below the legal working age, in jobs that can be physically, mentally, emotionally, or morally harmful. It is a significant problem in many countries, including India, where millions of children are involved in various forms of work. Child labor can have detrimental effects on the overall well-being, growth, and development of children, particularly concerning their health, education, and social integration. Addressing child labor as a human rights challenge suggests that it is not only an economic or social issue but also a moral and ethical one that concerns the dignity and the basic rights of children. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have established international standards and regulations to prevent child labor and protect children's rights. India, as a signatory to both these global frameworks, has a responsibility to take measures to combat child labor and uphold the rights of its children. The issue of child labor in India is intertwined with other human rights challenges mentioned in the paragraph, like maternal and child care, child education, child abuse, and protection of minorities and weaker sections of society. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality education, social norms, and discrimination often contribute to the prevalence of child labor in the country. Children from marginalized communities, including minorities and weaker sections of society, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to their socio-economic conditions. Addressing the challenge of child labor in India involves several strategies, including enforcing existing child labor laws more effectively, raising awareness among parents and communities about the adverse effects of child labor, providing access to quality education, and implementing social protection measures that support vulnerable families to secure sustainable livelihoods. It is essential for all stakeholders, including government agencies, non-government organizations, civil society, businesses, and individuals, to collaborate and take concerted efforts to eliminate child labor and ensure that the fundamental rights of children are respected and protected across India. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed determine that child labor is a significant challenge in India concerning human rights. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses legislative measures, educational reforms, social protection mechanisms, and cooperation among various stakeholders working together to promote and protect the rights of children in the country."},{"prompt":"Information: - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany.

Arquitectonica, on the other hand, was founded in 1977 and has been influential in defining the architectural landscape of Miami and other cities across the world. Bernardo Fort-Brescia, one of Arquitectonica's founders, has a Peruvian background, enhancing the firm's global perspective. Despite the firm's international reach, it has always maintained Miami as its headquarters. Arquitectonica and MarinaBlue share a close geographical relationship given both are based in Miami, a city noted for its architecture and skyline. They are landmarks in the same urban landscape - Miami, known globally for its modern and sleek architecture characterized by a mix of art deco, contemporary, and postmodern styles. Another forming bond is the connection through the urban fabric of the city. The architectural significance and contribution of Arquitectonica to the Miami skyline coexist with buildings such as MarinaBlue. One direct connection between Arquitectonica and a skyscraper in Miami is the AmericanAirlines Arena, a sports and entertainment venue where Arquitectonica collaborated with 360 Architecture on the design. While this doesn't directly tie Arquitectonica to the design and construction of MarinaBlue, it does emphasize its influence and importance in shaping the architecture of high-rise buildings in Miami. However, without specific information stating that Arquitectonica designed MarinaBlue, we cannot definitively say that there is a direct architectural relationship between them. More information would be needed to accurately make that claim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

In the story, people suspected that Aranrhod wasn't a virgin anymore (which means she had been with a man) because she gave birth to two children.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"LZMA stands for Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm. These files incorporate a type of compression algorithm that is utilized to compress or decompress data. In essence, LZMA reduces the size of a file or a collection of files, making distribution or storage significantly more manageable. Understanding the LZMA ---- LZMA is a lossless compression method, meaning it can compress files without losing any data or introducing any errors. This is an important feature for developers and other professionals who require exact copies of files after decompression. LZMA is best known for its use in the 7z format in 7-Zip, a free file compression and decompression software, much akin to WinZip and WinRAR. Working of LZMA ---- Under the hood, LZMA works by finding duplicated strings within a file. Once it recognizes redundancy, it only stores the initial string and then makes references to it whenever the string is repeated elsewhere. Thus, it reduces the overall size of the file. Features and Advantages of LZMA ------ LZMA is known for its high compression ratio. This means it can make files significantly smaller than other archiving methods, such as ZIP or RAR. Furthermore, it offers optional encryption for further file protection. The compression, though taking longer than some other methods, ensures that the file is as small as it can possibly be, a benefit that makes the waiting worthwhile for many users. It is especially useful for large data files since it can dramatically decrease the required storage space and increase the speed of file transfers. Despite its high compression ratio, LZMA doesn't require a lot of computational power to decompress, meaning you can unpack files quickly on most devices. However, file compression requires considerably more processing power. Applications of LZMA ----- LZMA format can be used in various applications. For example, software developers often use it to reduce large software packages making distribution easier. In gaming platforms, LZMA helps to keep the size of game files manageable. LZMA is also used in some Linux distributions like Ubuntu to compress the installation package. Interacting with an LZMA file ------ The common tools for interacting with LZMA files are 7-Zip and LZMA SDK. 7-Zip is a free and open-source file archiver that supports several archival formats, including LZMA. With 7-Zip, you can easily compress and decompress the LZMA files on PC. LZMA SDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation to help developers create software that utilizes or supports LZMA compression. In conclusion, LZMA files are a highly efficient way of storing large amounts of data in a compressed format, with numerous programming and user-friendly applications enabling easy interaction with these files. However, the spaces between words in LZMA files or any file can't be removed without causing potential data loss, altering the file's information, or possibly rendering the file useless. If the reference to removing spaces is due to an issue with readability or parsing the file, it might be best to use software specifically designed for reading or editing your particular file type."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Former CIA director James Woolsey, an adviser to Trump on national security issues, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult, but that he believes the Russians -- and possibly others -- were involved. \\"I think the Russians were in there, but it doesn't mean other people weren't, too,\\" he said. \\"It's often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There's lots of tricks.\\" Asked if Trump is playing the media with his comments on who was culpable, Woolsey said it was a \\"possibility,\\" noting that Trump is an \\"expert in weaving around\\" on issues like this. \\"Sometimes people may have been talking to somebody in the National Security Agency and have an idea that maybe it was one type of hacking rather than another,\\" he said. \\"I don't think this is of substantial matter. I think it's basically just dialogue back and forth.\\" Speaking on Tuesday on CNN's \\"New Day,\\" Woolsey stressed his belief that more than one country was involved in hacking US Democratic organizations and individuals. \\"Is it Russian? Probably some,\\" the Trump adviser told Chris Cuomo, adding that China and Iran could also have been involved. \\"It shouldn't be portrayed as one guilty party. It's much more complicated than that.\\" He added, \\"This is not an organized an operation ... It's not like taking a number at a bakery and standing in line to politely get your dozen cookies ... it's more like a bunch of jackals at the carcass of an antelope.\\" Woolsey's comments come even as Trump and his aides continue to cast doubt on the links between Russia and recent hacks against Democrats, while US intelligence officials say that newly identified \\"digital fingerprints\\" indicate Moscow was behind the intrusions. One official told CNN the administration has traced the hack to the specific keyboards -- which featured Cyrillic characters -- that were used to construct the malware code, adding that the equipment leaves \\"digital fingerprints\\" and, in the case of the recent hacks, those prints point to the Russian government. In response to the US information, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov told CNN: \\"I don't understand what this means exactly, but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere. Once again, I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way.\\" Despite an initial public assessment by the US intelligence community in October that Russia was behind the intrusions, Trump and his staff continue to voice doubts. \\"The idea that we're jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is, frankly, irresponsible,\\" Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Monday. Trump expressed skepticism on New Year's Eve, saying, \\"I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.\\" He also claimed to have inside information on the matter, which he said he would reveal later this week. Asked how Trump would be getting that type of information, Woolsey said on \\"New Day\\" that people inside the US intelligence community may be reaching out for Trump. \\"He could have people talking to him from within the system,\\" Woolsey said. Spicer said Trump was \\"going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand,\\" adding the President-elect would \\"make sure people understand that there's a lot of questions out there.\\" A second US official told CNN Monday there is increasingly confidence in the intelligence analysis, citing the ability to collect extremely high-quality intel on Russia, compared the difficulty of doing so with more secretive regimes like North Korea. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report last week that they said \\"provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.\\" The report added that the Russian culprits also have historically targeted \\"a range of US Government, political, and private sector entities\\" using similar tactics. Spicer said Trump would await the results of the investigation ordered by President Barack Obama as he insisted that the assessments of the intelligence community published so far did not constitute the \\"final report.\\" He said Trump was expected to be briefed about that report in coming days. Trump is facing mounting pressure to undertake a robust response to Russia's activities, with Republican leaders in Congress saying that Obama's recent cyber-related sanctions of Russian intelligence entities and expulsion of some Russians from the US don't go far enough. \\"It is clear that Russia has attacked the United States of America. All of our intelligence agencies will affirm that that's been the case. We will work in the Congress to have stronger sanctions in order to prevent further attacks,\\" Republican Sen.

Chief Strategist & Communications Director for the Republican National Committee Sean Spicer arrives in the lobby of Republican president-elect Donald Trump's Trump Tower in New York, New York, U.S. November 14, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri “There is zero evidence that they influenced the election,” Sean Spicer told Fox News. Due to become White House press secretary when Trump enters the White House on Jan. 20, Spicer told CNN the president-elect would see the intelligence report once it was completed later this week. On Saturday, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia for the hacking of U.S. emails. “The idea that we’re jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is irresponsible,” Spicer told CNN. President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last week for alleged Kremlin involvement in hacking that intelligence officials said aimed to help the Republican Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Leading lawmakers from both parties have voiced alarm at the suggestion of Russian interference, whether or not it made a difference in the outcome. Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a Thursday hearing on foreign cyber threats. The new Congress, elected on Nov. 8, takes office on Tuesday. Calling for closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has repeatedly played down the hacking affair. Over the weekend Trump said he knew “things that other people don’t know” and would disclose some information on the issue on Tuesday or Wednesday. He gave no further detail. “He’s going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand,” Spicer told CNN. “He’s not going to reveal anything that was privileged or shared with him classified.” On Sunday Spicer said the White House may have disproportionately punished Russia. “It’s baffling,” U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC on Monday. “President-elect Trump does not have any better information than President Obama.” A Gallup Poll released on Monday showed less than half of Americans were confident in Trump’s ability to handle an international crisis, to use military force wisely or to prevent major scandals in his administration. The poll said at least seven in 10 Americans were confident in presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in those areas before they took office. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article discusses various aspects of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, focusing on several key topics: 1.

Article: Ask yourself what types of businesses or consumers you want to reach and what their interests are. Consider how your ideal customer or your target market are influenced and how they make their decisions. Try to be as specific as possible. For example, if you are marketing a new baby product you may target middle-upper class expectant mothers. If you are marketing a protein supplement for healthy weight gain, you may target men ages 24-40. What makes your company or brand stand apart from the other competitors? Think about the services your company offers that you are most proud of or confident in, and how this provides a certain value for your customers. For example, you may be able to provide the lowest prices for a new baby product, or the highest quality protein supplements in the market. Once you’ve identified your target audience, or customer, as well as your unique value, you need to then provide evidence to back up your claims. You need to get your customer to believe in your company’s ability to prove its value and follow through on its marketing promises. For example, you may note that your company eliminates costly overhead by only selling the new baby product online. Or you may note that you have a unique partnership with producers to sell only the highest quality protein supplements. It’s important to only claim as much as you can prove or follow through on. Don’t make exaggerated or unreasonable value claims, such as, “we will match any other price you find online”, if your company or brand is not willing to actually commit to this claim and follow through on it. Most position statements follow the same template: For [insert Target Market], the [insert Brand] is the [insert Point of Differentiation] among all[insert Frame of Reference] because [insert Reason to Believe]. The point of differentiation (POD) should describe how your brand or new product will help your customers in ways that distinguish you from your competitors. The frame of reference (FOR) is the category or segment in the market where your company competes with other companies. The reason to believe should be a compelling phrase that gives your customer a reason to believe in your claims. For example, Amazon’s position statement is: For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon.com is a retail bookseller that provides instant access to over 1.1 million books. Note that Amazon identifies its target market, places its brand up front, inserts the market it is operating in, and notes how it will follow through on its claim. Another example is Volvo’s position statement: For upscale American families, Volvo is the family automobile that offers maximum safety. This is a less specific position statement than the Amazon statement, but it still communicates Volvo’s brand. Volvo notes its target market, inserts its operating market, and includes how the brand will make consumers believe it’s claim. Look at the position statement examples, as well as the template and create several possible position statements for your company. Say you are trying to market a new baby toy. Your target market may be middle to upper class expectant mothers, you are marketing for the baby toys sector, and you feel your product is unique because it is sold exclusively online at a low price and offers educational value as well as recreational play for mother and child. Your initial position statement may be long and detailed. For example: For middle to upper class expectant mothers, BabaTots is a baby toy that offers fun and engaging play for mother and child, at an affordable price point and only available online. You may then streamline your first try so the statement is concise and clear. For example: For middle to upper class expectant mothers, BabaTots is an interactive baby toy that provides educational value and recreational play for mother and child at an affordable price point. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides guidance on how to effectively create a positioning statement for a company or brand.

Question: Why is the narrator feeling less stressed ?","completion":"The narrator is feeling less stressed for several reasons. Each of these factors contributes to an overall improvement in their well-being and a reduction in stress levels. Let's discuss some of the main factors in more detail: 1. Finding an apartment in Salem: Searching for a suitable place to live can be a very stressful experience, as it requires time, effort, and the consideration of numerous factors such as location, affordability, and available amenities. Finally finding an apartment that meets the narrator's needs, particularly in the desired location of Salem, has provided them with a sense of relief and accomplishment. This in turn has reduced their stress levels, as they no longer need to worry about finding appropriate accommodation. 2. The historical home on Summer Street: The apartment is in a historical home, which may add charm and character to the living space. These attributes can contribute to a more enjoyable and unique living experience, which in turn may have a positive impact on the narrator's stress levels. 3. Proximity to school: The apartment's close proximity to school can significantly reduce the narrator's commute time and make it more convenient for them to attend classes and engage in campus activities. This may help to reduce their stress levels by allowing them to allocate more time to studying, socializing, and engaging in other important activities that contribute to a balanced lifestyle. 4. Close to the Local Yarn Store (LYS) and other shops downtown: The apartment's location is just a block away from the LYS and other shops downtown, which means that the narrator has easy access to shopping, dining, and recreational opportunities. This can have a positive impact on their overall stress levels by allowing them to engage in more leisure activities and pursue hobbies that bring them pleasure and relaxation, such as shopping at the LYS. 5. The apartment's size: While the apartment is small, the narrator mentions that it suits them well. This suggests that they are content with the space and that it meets their needs. Having a living space that feels comfortable and suitable to one's preferences can contribute to a sense of well-being and reduced stress levels. 6. Overall convenience: The combination of the apartment's location, close to both school and downtown amenities, makes the narrator's life more manageable and convenient. They can easily access important resources and services without having to go out of their way or spend excessive time traveling. A convenient and accessible living situation can have a profound impact on a person's overall stress levels. In conclusion, the narrator is feeling less stressed because they have found an apartment that meets their needs, both in terms of location and size. Additionally, the apartment's proximity to school and local shops makes their life more convenient and enjoyable. This combination of factors contributes to a more balanced and relaxed lifestyle, which in turn helps to reduce their stress levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When planning a project, event, or any other activity, it is essential to take into account various factors that may impact its success. This includes considering the needs and preferences of the people involved, available resources, potential risks, and any constraints that may arise. Some steps to take this into account during the planning process include: 1. Identifying objectives: Before starting the planning process, it is important to clearly define your goals and objectives. Knowing what you want to achieve will help guide your decision-making and ensure that you focus on elements that contribute to the project's success. 2. Gathering information: Research and collect data on all the factors that may affect the planning process, such as target audience preferences, logistical details, governmental regulations, and cultural considerations. This information will help you better understand the context within which you are working and inform your planning choices. 3. Analyzing the information: After gathering relevant data, analyze it to determine its potential impact on the planning process. This might involve conducting a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify internal and external factors, as well as reviewing past projects to learn from previous experiences. 4. Establishing priorities: Once you've analyzed the information, establish your priorities to help you focus on the most important aspects of the project. This may involve ranking tasks according to their urgency or importance or aligning them with specific objectives. 5. Developing a plan: Create a detailed plan that outlines your strategies, action items, timelines, and resources required for successful implementation. This plan should be flexible, allowing for adjustments as new information becomes available or circumstances change. 6. Regularly reviewing and updating the plan: Regularly review the plan and make any necessary adjustments to account for changes in circumstances and new information. This will help ensure that the project remains on track and continues to align with your objectives. 7. Communicating with stakeholders: Throughout the planning process, maintain open lines of communication with all stakeholders, including team members, clients, and partners. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and can contribute their insights to the planning process. By following these steps and taking all factors into account, you can create a well-rounded plan that leads to a successful outcome. Remember to be adaptable and flexible, as circumstances can change and new information may become available during the planning process.

We want to find out what number \\"y\\" is in this problem: 783 * y + 7950 = -6144 1. First, we want to get y all by itself on one side. So let's move the 7950 from the left side to the right side. To do that, we'll subtract 7950 from both sides: 783 * y = -6144 - 7950 2. Now, let's calculate -6144 - 7950: -6144 - 7950 = -14094 So now we have: 783 * y = -14094 3. Now, we want to find out what y is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 783: y = -14094 / 783 4. And finally, let's do the division: y ≈ -18 So, the answer is y ≈ -18, which means y is about -18."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Total annual electricity generation increased by 23% between 1990 and 2004. Translate to French.","completion":"La production annuelle totale d'électricité a augmenté de 23% entre 1990 et 2004. La production totale d'électricité a connu une augmentation significative tout au long des années 1990 et au début des années 2000. Entre 1990 et 2004, cette augmentation a représenté 23 % de la production annuelle totale. Cette croissance considérable est le résultat de divers facteurs, tels que l'augmentation de la demande en énergie, l'essor économique et l'expansion démographique. Durant cette période, le secteur énergétique mondial s'est efforcé de fournir suffisamment d'énergie pour répondre aux besoins croissants, notamment grâce à des efforts pour améliorer l'efficacité énergétique et développer des technologies d'énergie renouvelable. Le progrès technologique, les politiques gouvernementales et les investissements dans l'infrastructure ont également joué un rôle important dans l'augmentation de la production d'électricité annuelle totale. Néanmoins, malgré cette croissance impressionnante, la production d'électricité au cours de cette période a été principalement basée sur les combustibles fossiles, tels que le charbon, le pétrole et le gaz naturel. Ces sources d'énergie non renouvelables ont de nombreux impacts négatifs sur l'environnement, y compris les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, qui contribuent au changement climatique. Cet état de fait a mené à une prise de conscience des défis environnementaux et une volonté croissante de s'orienter vers des sources d'énergie plus durables et respectueuses de l'environnement. Ainsi, en réponse à cette évolution, plusieurs pays ont commencé à adopter des politiques favorisant les énergies renouvelables et à investir dans la recherche et le développement de technologies propres. Dans ce contexte, l'augmentation de 23 % de la production totale d'électricité observée entre 1990 et 2004 montre l'importance de la transition énergétique et les défis qui restent à relever pour assurer un approvisionnement en énergie durable et respectueux de l'environnement pour les générations futures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France. Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo Buontalenti.

Question: What is Ida horrified to learn about Misty? Movie plot title: Sick Girl Movie plot: Ida Teeter (Angela Bettis) is a shy entomologist who has a wide variety of insects all over her home, which caused her girlfriend to break up with her. Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts.

You're more likely to have heard of David Beckham and Angelina Jolie than Jim Chapman or Zoella, but these YouTube vloggers are now more popular role models for young people than reality TV stars, Hollywood actors or footballers, according to research. When asked, almost 40 per cent of 16-25 year olds said they would prefer to follow in the footsteps of professional video bloggers than make a living from being a reality TV star (6 per cent) or even from a career such as law or politics (34 per cent). Almost one in three young people are avid viewers and fans of YouTube vlogs, tuning in at least twice a week; with almost half of these admitting to watching their favourite YouTube stars over ten times a weekly.","completion":"The rise of YouTube vloggers as role models in today's society is a testament to the changing landscape of influence and ambition amongst today's youth. This phenomenon is indicative of the shift towards identifying with internet personalities, who often share a more relatable and authentic connection with their audience in comparison to traditional celebrities like David Beckham and Angelina Jolie. The research findings mentioned suggest that young individuals are gravitating towards the lifestyles and achievements of their favorite YouTube vloggers rather than those of reality TV stars, Hollywood actors or footballers. This preference for online content creators is primarily due to the ease of accessibility that the internet provides, enabling fans to engage with their influencers, receive instant updates and even interact with them personally. Vloggers often showcase their daily lives, interests, and challenges, offering a sense of transparency that is lacking in the heavily controlled world of traditional celebrity. This allows their followers to build direct connections with them, creating a more profound sense of loyalty and admiration. Moreover, choosing a career as a professional video blogger over traditional occupations such as law or politics highlights the desire for personal fulfillment and creative expression. YouTube vloggers have the luxury of designing their own content, setting their schedules, and being their own bosses – features that are incredibly alluring to the younger generation who value independence and self-actualization. Additionally, vloggers can influence and inspire their audiences on a broad range of topics, showcasing their niche or expertise, making the platform a melting pot of diverse voices and perspectives. Social media, and YouTube in particular, has opened up a world of opportunities for anyone with a vision to share, irrespective of their background, and the exponential growth of avid viewers and fans is indicative of the platform's popularity. Watching their favorite YouTube stars over ten times a week is not merely a pastime for youngsters, but a way to feel connected, inspired, and motivated in a rapidly evolving society. In conclusion, the changing dynamics of role models for young people today signifies a shift in values, aspirations, and ideals. YouTube vloggers, with their relatable content and accessibility, are rising to prominence as the new generation's preferred role models, providing a unique sense of authenticity, self-expression, and creativity.

On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.

They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The teleosts or Teleostei (Greek: \\"teleios\\", \\"complete\\" + \\"osteon\\", \\"bone\\") are by far the largest infraclass in the class Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes, and make up 96 percent of all fish. This diverse group arose in the Triassic period and members are arranged in about 40 orders and 448 families. Over 26,000 species have been described. Teleosts range from giant oarfish, measuring or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over , to the minute male anglerfish \\"Photocorynus spiniceps\\", just long. As well as torpedo-shaped fish built for speed, teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally, be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses. Teleosts dominate the seas from pole to pole and inhabit the ocean depths, estuaries, rivers, lakes and even swamps. - The ocean sunfish or common mola (\\"Mola mola\\") is the heaviest known bony fish in the world. It has an average adult weight between . The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Photocorynus spiniceps is a species of anglerfish in the family Linophrynidae. It is in the monotypic genus \\"Photocorynus\\". - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - The modern torpedo is a self-propelled weapon with an explosive warhead, launched above or below the water surface, propelled underwater towards a target, and designed to detonate either on contact with its target or in proximity to it. - Anglerfishes are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes . They are bony fish named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which a fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure. - Actinopterygii , or the ray-finned fishes, constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - This article is about a group of ray - finned fish called Acanthomorpha or acanthomorphs . \`\` '' Acanthomorph '' \`\` is also a descriptive name for a spiny - walled subgroup of the microscopic fossils called acritarchs . Acanthomorpha ( meaning \`\` thorn - shaped '' in Greek ) is a huge taxon of teleost fishes with spiny - rays . The clade contains about one third of the world 's modern species of vertebrates : over 14,000 species . A key anatomical innovation in acanthomorphs is hollow and unsegmented spines at the anterior edge of the dorsal and anal fins . A fish can extend these sharp bony spines to protect itself from predators , but can also retract them to decrease drag when swimming . Another shared feature is a particular rostral cartilage , associated with ligaments attached to the rostrum and premaxilla , that enables the fish to protrude its jaws considerably to catch food . Rosen coined the name in 1973 to describe a clade comprising Acanthopterygii , Paracanthopterygii , and also ctenothrissiform fossils from the Cretaceous Period , such as \`\` '' Aulolepis '' \`\` and \`\` '' Ctenothrissa '' \`\` . Those fossils share several details of the skeleton , and especially of the skull , with modern acanthomorphs . Originally based on anatomy , Acanthomorpha has been borne out by more recent molecular analyses . - The giant oarfish (\\"Regalecus glesne\\") is a species of oarfish of the family Regalecidae. It is an oceanodromous species with a worldwide distribution, excluding polar regions. Other common names include Pacific oarfish, king of herrings, ribbonfish, and streamer fish. - Seahorse is the name given to 54 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus. \\"Hippocampus\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \\"hippos\\" meaning \\"horse\\" and \\"kampos\\" meaning \\"sea monster\\". The word \\"seahorse\\" can also be written as two separate words (sea horse), or hyphenated (sea-horse). Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".

The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately about 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level. Are there any alternatives to the public school system in Burma ?","completion":"Yes, there are several alternatives to the public school system in Myanmar (also known as Burma). These alternatives aim to provide a different educational experience, often focusing on unique teaching methods, additional subject areas, or an international curriculum. Some of the alternatives to the public school system in Myanmar include: 1. Private schools: These are non-government funded schools that generally charge tuition fees for students to attend. Private schools tend to have smaller class sizes, which can lead to a more personalized education. They also tend to offer more resources and extracurricular activities than public schools. Some private schools follow an international curriculum or specific educational philosophies like Montessori or International Baccalaureate (IB). 2. International schools: These schools cater to the requirements of an international student body and often focus on preparing students for higher education or career opportunities abroad. International schools may offer a curriculum that follows educational guidelines from countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, or other regions of the world. These schools typically require teachers to have specialized training and qualifications. Students who attend international schools can earn globally recognized qualifications including the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Advanced Placement (AP) courses. 3. Religious schools: Religious schools, such as Buddhist monastic schools or Christian missionary schools, offer education with an emphasis on religious teachings and values. Some of these schools provide general education alongside religious teachings, while others focus solely on religious education. In Myanmar, Buddhist monastic schools have played a significant role in providing education to socio-economically underprivileged children. 4. Community-based schools: These schools are organized and maintained by local communities and may provide alternative teaching methods and curricula that reflect local culture and traditions. Community-based schools often operate in rural or remote areas where access to government-operated schools may be limited. In some instances, they are established to empower a particular ethnic minority or marginalized group. 5. Homeschooling: Although not widespread in Myanmar, some parents choose to homeschool their children as an alternative to the traditional school system. This approach allows parents to customize the education experience, including the curriculum, teaching methods, and learning pace, according to the child's needs and interests. However, homeschooling may not be legally recognized, and there may be limited resources and support networks available to homeschooling families. In conclusion, there are several alternatives to the public school system in Myanmar, each with its own unique characteristics. These alternative schooling options can provide valuable educational experiences to students and cater to specific needs, interests, and belief systems. It is essential for families to consider their specific requirements when choosing an educational pathway for their children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Gavino Garay reports. EIGHT-MONTH-OLD Santiago Mendoza might look like a happy, cuddly little tot but the reality is that he is very sick. Santiago, who weighs 19.7kg — the equivalent of a six-year-old child — has been ‘rescued’ from his family by Colombian health charity Chubby Hearts. Volunteers from the foundation spirited the grossly obese infant away from his home in the north east city of Valledupar to a hospital in Bogota for urgent medical treatment. The intervention came after his mother Eunice Fandino wrote to Chubby Hearts for help after Santiago became too heavy to take outside. Ms Fandino blamed her own ‘‘ignorance’’ for Santiago’s weight gain and admitted she fed him every time he cried. “He was born with an anxiety, so if he cried I just fed him,” she told local media. Santiago’s weight has landed him in hospital on several occasions in the past. He is now being assessed by specialists. Chubby Hearts foundation director Salvador Palacio Gonzalez said doctors will attempt to reduce his weight to a manageable level before carrying out a series of operations. “Otherwise, in the future, he could suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and severe problems with his joints,” Mr Gonzalez said.

Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Thomas Cartwright is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England. Cartwright's controversial lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration abroad. Between 1645 and 1648, a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England. Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places in England, although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament never enforced the Presbyterian system in England. The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England (and in Scotland for a short time); but the Presbyterian church in England continued in Non-Conformity, outside of the established church. In 1719 a major split, the Salter's Hall controversy, occurred; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian views. Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy, and in 1719, \\"An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed their belief of the Eternal Trinity.\\".

A:","completion":"\\"Age to get better\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it demonstrates an understanding that certain types of cheese improve in taste and quality as they are aged, typically in a controlled environment like a cellar. Aging allows the flavors to develop and mature, resulting in a better-tasting cheese.

Leon Edwards sold sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid to a reporter posing as the relation of an autistic child. Combined, the chemicals form bleach. The BBC has also learned the secret location of a conference to begin in Surrey on Friday to promote the 'cure'. When confronted with the evidence, Mr Edwards made no comment. Mr Edwards has been linked to the Genesis II Church, an American organisation which describes itself as a \\"non-religious church of health and healing\\". This is purportedly achieved through the used of so-called \\"Miracle Mineral Solution\\" (MMS), a bleach which is produced by mixing the two chemicals. Experts said it is untrue any such mixture could cure autism and warned its use could lead to serious harm or death. Some of the leading figures in the 'church' have travelled from the US to attend the conference, due to take place in a manor house in Farnham. Emails obtained by the BBC show delegates have been told to meet at a certain location before being driven to the venue, where they will be instructed in preparing doses of MMS to be consumed orally and taken via enemas. Through his website, Mr Edwards, who says he is not attending the conference, sold the researcher the one bottle of liquid labelled as 22.4% sodium chlorite and a second labelled as 4% hydrochloric acid. When the BBC sent the chemicals to Kent Scientific Services, an independent laboratory, they were found to be 57% and 45% stronger than the advertised concentration respectively. The researcher then met Mr Edwards at King's Cross Station for a paid-for demonstration as to how they should be mixed and imbibed. Mr Edwards told him: \\"It's helping people get well from all sorts of diseases - cancer, HIV, malaria. It's cleaning the body out. And nearly all the illnesses are getting removed with this. \\"I'm not gonna say cure... because I can get in trouble. I'd say purge. It can purge autism. Alzheimer's too. \\"170 children have had their diagnosis removed of autism in four years.\\" Mr Edwards advised 27 drops of MMS per day for a baby - administered with a baby's bottle. Of his own use, he said: \\"I put it in my eyes, my nose, my ears, bathe in it, drunk it, breathed it in my lungs. I got injected in my butt with it. \\"They're never gonna shut me down. All they can do is put me in a prison cell.\\" Last month a jury in the US state of Washington convicted Genesis II member Louis Daniel Smith for selling MMS as a \\"miracle cure\\". He faces a maximum of 34 years in prison. Carol Povey, of the National Autistic Society, said: \\"No evidence of any kind exists to support the preposterous claims made for MMS as an intervention for autism. \\"It is shocking that dubious companies continue to promote potentially very harmful products like these. \\"Autism is a complex neurological condition, without a cure.\\" Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP, said ingesting bleach could cause scarring to the oesophagus, damage to the stomach and even death. She explained: \\"A very small amount of concentrated bleach has the possibility of doing great harm. \\"This is particularly true of a child's gut lining, which is thinner than an adults. \\"It is an extra danger that people are self-administering this as the dose could easily be got wrong.\\" Prof Richard Goldberg, expert in pharmaceutical law at Durham Law School, warned selling sodium chlorite for consumption breached the Food Supplements England Regulations. \\"This is a potential criminal offence,\\" he said. \\"The Food Standards Agency has to inform the relevant local authority and the authority has to take action. \\"There is a very strong argument that he is selling an unauthorised food supplement. There is a potential argument for him selling an unauthorised medicine.\\" An organiser of the Genesis II Church conference described MMS as a \\"sacrament\\" that was \\"no different than the bread and wine given during a church service\\". The spokeswoman continued: \\"The so-called side effects are far less than [in] drugs sold by pharmaceutical companies. \\"We are not selling any products during the church services. We simply conduct our services and share our news and protocols. \\"Table salt is dangerous if taken too much [sic].\\" Surrey County Council says it will try to disrupt the conference and warned the public against trying MMS. Fiona O'Leary, a mother of two autistic children, is a leading campaigner against MMS. She warned: \\"This has been offered as a cure for autism in 60 countries. \\"What worries me is people normalising this treatment - it does not even warrant the word treatment, autism is not a 'disease' that you can 'cure' with bleach. \\"We need legislation so that people offering it are always prosecuted, but we don't see the authorities addressing this issue.\\" She added: \\"The suffering children are going through is shocking - it's child abuse.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"A man named Leon Edwards was selling chemicals that, when combined, make bleach. He said it could help cure diseases like autism and cancer, but experts say that's not true and could be very dangerous. The chemicals are connected to a group called the Genesis II Church, which says they can heal people, but it's not proven.

Avoid this place at all costs.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer evidently had an unfavorable experience at the Indian restaurant in question. Several aspects of the dining experience led the reviewer to express their deep dissatisfaction with the food and the overall experience. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the food was \\"offensively bad\\" and that they have \\"never had worse Indian food.\\" This expression highlights the extreme disappointment they felt with the meal. Their discontent is further emphasized when they describe the rice as tasting \\"gross\\" and not being of the expected basmati variety. Moreover, the reviewer emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the lack of flavor and authenticity in the dishes, using words like \\"flavorless\\" and stating that the dishes were \\"not recognizable as Indian food.\\" This highlights the disconnect between the reviewer's expectations and the actual food served at the establishment. Additionally, the complaint extends to the naan, which the reviewer claims was \\"stale.\\" Such critiques indicate that not only did the main dishes fail to meet expectations, but the accompanying bread did not meet their standards either. To underscore the magnitude of their disappointment, the reviewer compares the restaurant's dishes unfavorably to other food sources, stating that they have had \\"better and fresher tasting Indian food\\" from the Whole Foods food bar or even from a box. This comparison makes it very clear that they found the quality of the food to be well below their expectations. The brief duration of their visit, as the reviewer mentions that they left after fifteen minutes, further reflects the strong negative sentiment. They felt the food was so unpalatable that they could not find anything \\"remotely good\\" and preferred to leave promptly. Finally, the reviewer suggests alternative restaurants (Bombay or Curry House) for those seeking \\"delicious authentic Indian food\\" and urges readers to \\"avoid this place at all costs.\\" This strong language serves as a warning to potential future customers and reinforces the overall negative sentiment of the review. In summary, the sentiment expressed in the review is highly negative, demonstrating extreme dissatisfaction with the taste, quality, and authenticity of the Indian food offered at the restaurant. The reviewer leaves no doubt about their disappointment and advises potential diners to avoid the establishment, further emphasizing their unfavorable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The review provided clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer appears to be highly disappointed with the book, perceiving it as a wasted investment of both time and money. This negative perception is evident through multiple critical remarks made by the reviewer. Firstly, the reviewer accuses the author of shamelessly capitalizing on the contemporary generation x phenomenon, implying that the book was crafted with the primary intention of generating profits rather than providing a quality literary experience. This accusation sets a negative tone, suggesting the book's content might be shallow and uninspired. Secondly, the reviewer calls out the alleged overuse of token references to further emphasize the book's connection to generation x. This critique indicates that the book may rely too heavily on stereotypes and one-dimensional characters, rendering the narrative flat and unconvincing. Ultimately, this diminishes the reader's immersion and connection with the story and its characters. Furthermore, the reviewer asserts that the book insults the reader's intelligence, suggesting that the content may be oversimplified or lack depth. This critical remark implies that the book does not meet the standards of an intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking read. In conclusion, this review portrays the product in an undoubtedly unflattering light by highlighting the book's perceived superficiality, reliance on stereotypes, and lack of depth.

Come prepared with a list of topics that you’d like to discuss. Be prepared to talk about how you’ve experienced pain during sex. Ask them about possible treatments. Depending on the potential diagnosis, your doctor may also order tests or bloodwork. For example, endometriosis is a painful medical condition that can effect women and must be diagnosed by a physician. If left untreated, it can cause a woman a great deal of pain during intercourse. Other medical causes of painful sex include eczema in sensitive areas, vaginismus or spasms in the vagina, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts, or scarring from surgery. Different types of pain might signal certain issues. Tell your doctor when during intercourse you feel pain and what type of pain it is. Some questions you might want to answer include: Do you have pain during penetration or only during thrusting? Does the pain last after sex? Does the pain throb, burn, or ache? Is this a new pain or an old condition? If you are suffering from a lack (or excess) of testosterone, estrogen, or another hormone, this could impact your level of pleasure or pain during sex. Talk with your doctor about possible treatment options to correct any hormonal problems. They may suggest a cream, a medicated ring, oral medications, or a treatment patch. Some of these treatments can be highly successful with up to 75 percent of patients stating that their sexual pain lessened. Menopause, birth, breastfeeding, and polycystic ovary syndrome can all affect your hormones, leading to painful sex. If you have any type of sexual transmitted disease (STD), make sure to talk with your doctor before engaging in sexual intercourse. Also, seek out treatment if you are suffering from any type of genital infection as it could likely cause dryness and pain during sex. For example, men and women can both suffer from cystitis, which is a bladder infection that can cause pain during intercourse. Another common cause is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Visit your doctor get a prescription for an antibiotic. If you have a prior injury, then working with a physical therapist could help to increase your movement and flexibility. These changes may also lessen your pain during sex. Older persons may find physical therapy helpful as well, especially if they suffer from nerve conditions. You can find a therapist in your area by going to the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) website. A sex therapist will talk with you alone, or with you and your partner, about any concerns regarding your sex life. They might be able to offer exercises or communication tactics to lessen pain during intercourse. If you’ve been sexually assaulted in the past, it is probably a good idea to talk with a counselor. This will help you to find pleasure, instead of pain, from sex. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: Pain during sex can be caused by various factors, including medical conditions, hormonal imbalances, infections, or even past trauma. To address this issue, it is important to make an appointment with a primary care physician or OBGYN and discuss your symptoms in detail. They may suggest treatments, order tests or bloodwork to identify the underlying cause. Depending on the diagnosis, potential treatment options may include hormone replacement, antibiotics for infections, or even working with a physical therapist for increased movement and flexibility. In some cases, a sex therapist or counselor might be recommended for addressing psychological or relationship concerns. Taking proactive steps to identify and treat the causes of pain during sex can significantly improve one's sexual well-being and overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- It's very rarely African cities get compared with their flashy European counterparts, yet, when it comes to cost of living Lagos isn't just competing with its neighbors in Europe -- it's beating them. Hotel rooms in Lagos, now the 30th most expensive city in the world, now cost hundreds of dollars a night. Nigeria's coastal economic and financial capital is the shock entry in the top 50 cities of this year's Mercer Cost of Living survey. The vibrant home to almost eight million Nigerians beat off the likes of Barcelona, Berlin and Brussels, and even U.S. locations such as Washington and Los Angeles -- to be rated the 30th most expensive city in the world. \\"I think [","completion":"it] is because Lagos is growing really fast,\\" said one person who knows about these things. \\"A lot of people are coming to live and work here, so that means more people need places to stay and things to buy. It's like a big, busy city that has lots of people who want to live there, like big cities in Europe and America.\\" In Lagos, Nigeria, which is a city in Africa, things are getting more expensive. Do you know what \\"expensive\\" means? It means that you have to pay more money to buy things or do things there. Lagos is now one of the top 50 most expensive cities in the whole world! This might seem surprising because people usually think of cities in Europe or America as being more expensive, but now Lagos is even more expensive than some of those places, like Barcelona, Berlin, and Brussels. Why do you think that happened? It's because there are many people who want to live and work in Lagos, so they need to find places to stay, like hotel rooms, and buy things they need. When lots of people want something, it can make the price go up. That's what's happening in Lagos, making it the 30th most expensive city in the world. Isn't that interesting?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the name of the person whose inventions always fail? Answer the above question based on the context below: Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.","completion":"The name of the person whose inventions always fail, according to the provided context, is Ishbo. Living in the Stone Age, Ishbo is a character who is distinguished for being more intelligent than most members of his tribe, but his ventures into innovation are largely unsuccessful. These failures can be attributed to the fragility of the materials available to him during the Stone Age, coupled with the absence of support from his tribespeople who likely do not share or understand his innovative visions. In addition to his constant struggle with failed inventions, this character also experiences heartbreak when Fardart, the woman he has loved since childhood, is abruptly married off to his stronger and more prominent brother, Thudnik. Ishbo's self-esteem plummets as he faces a crippling sense of inadequacy, thinking he will never be able to 'club' a woman—a traditional caveman courtship practice—like his brother Thudnik did. This despondency intensifies after his conspicuously unsuccessful attempt to club a woman, and again during a mammoth hunt when he is literally swallowed and excreted by a mammoth—symbolizing, perhaps, his tribe's disregard for his worth. Thus, encapsulating the trials and tribulations of a misunderstood and vulnerable Stone Age man, the character of Ishbo paints a vivid picture of an individual whose continuous failures, whether in his attempts at inventing or meeting societal expectations, define his existence within his tribe. His recurring debacles, as both innovator and suitor, outline his character arc, offering an insight into his tragicomic existence in a tribe that fails to recognize his unsophisticated but well-meant forward-thinking endeavours."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seven ways you're ruining your food, and why knife skills are life skills Being a good cook isn’t a magical skill that allows you to conjure delicious food from nothing. The truth is, ingredients taste pretty great anyway, and good cooking is often just a matter of making sure we don’t screw it up. But screw it up we so often do. Here are seven ways to ruin your food. I’ve written a lot about seasoning food but I’ll repeat it because seasoning really is the number one, scientifically proven, universally recommended key to cooking well. If you’re watching your sodium and decide not to salt your steak, or you leave out the pinch of sugar that would balance a sour tomato sauce, that’s your prerogative, but you should know that that one decision can be the difference between brilliant or bland. And of course by seasoning I’m talking about saltiness, sweetness, sourness, bitterness and umami – not herbs and spices … … While we’re on herbs and spices, relying on them to make your food taste good is a great way to miss the point completely. They can be great accents for many dishes, but they won’t make bad cooking good and will often make it worse. In the earlier days of processed food, shake-on spice mixes were all the rage. A flick of the wrist and your chicken could be covered in “Cajun seasoning” or your roast beef could take on the flavour of “herbes de Provence”. The real benefit of these early spice mixes, however, was adding extra salt and the umami of MSG to under-seasoned food. There’s nothing wrong with herbs and spices per se, but their overuse has been a classic case of misdirection. We were sold on the idea that spices were making our food taste good, when in fact it was just a vehicle for loading on the salt and MSG. I have no problem with salt or MSG either, truth be told, but it’s a common mistake to think that if some herbs and spices are making your food taste good, then more will make it taste better. I’ve eaten far too many meals overwhelmed with the contents of a spice rack when just good clean flavours would have been very welcome. “Well, duh,” I hear you say. Of course we all try to avoid overcooking our food if at all possible, but we don’t often pause to think about whether our idea of how much food to cook is even right in the first place. Almost every cuisine in the world has made a habit of severely overcooking just about everything, a relic of a less sanitary past. Meat was cooked until dull and grey, chicken made rubbery with all semblance of moisture long gone, and vegetables rendered limper than wet newspaper – these aren’t unfortunate mistakes, they’ve been the actual goals of cookery for centuries. In French cooking at least, the idea of eating a crisp green bean is little more than 40 years old. Our modern-day understanding of food safety allows us to eat medium-rare meat, pinkish poultry and crunchy vegetables where even just a few decades ago they would have been unthinkable. Many may still prefer well-done fillet steaks, soggy carrots and insipid beans, but then there’s no accounting for taste, is there? The average family cooks just five dishes, and repeats them again and again. From one perspective you could say that practice makes perfect, but if you never come across new ideas you’re just as likely to be making the same mistakes over and over. I’ve eaten dishes at Spanish restaurants that have changed the way I cook Chinese food, and stolen techniques from Michelin-starred restaurants that I employ for a simple Sunday afternoon barbecue. Every time you learn and change the way you cook it changes for the better. After all, you wouldn’t do it if it made your food worse, would you? Knife skills are life skills, and learning how to use, maintain and sharpen a knife is one of the most important things you will ever do in a kitchen. But how can a sharp knife affect your food? Simple. A huge part of cooking is creating texture, whether it’s in how you cut something or how you cook something that’s already been cut. There are few foods that don’t pass under a knife at some stage before they hit our lips. A good, sharp knife will produce fine and consistent cuts for fine and consistent texture. Never, ever underestimate how important that is. Fat has been the bad guy ever since manufacturers realised they could take it out of foods like milk and yoghurt and replace it with sugar, and then charge a premium for it. But fat is vital for good cooking: it tastes good, it carries flavour and it makes us more satisfied – but most importantly it’s necessary for so many of the cooking processes we use in our kitchens every day. A well-oiled pan will give you even heat for creating tasty brown crusts on food, it will separate out water that will otherwise steam food at too low a temperature and it will stop fish and meat from sticking to your pots. Trying to cook in a traditional way while removing fat from the process is like trying to drive a car after you’ve removed the tyres. Good things come to those who wait, and never a truer word was said about food. The list of foods that are spoiled by rushing them is long and distinguished. Serve a stew before the meat is truly softened? Pour a sauce five minutes before it’s reduced enough to concentrate its flavour? Skip resting your steak because you just damn well want to eat it? I could list hundreds of other examples, but any of these will be the last-hurdle stumble that ruins a perfectly good meal. Sometimes your most valuable tool in the kitchen is patience.

Don't rely on just herbs and spices: They can enhance food, but they won't fix bad cooking. 3. Don't overcook food: Cook meat and veggies to the right level for better taste and texture. 4.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was given borough status in the United Kingdom? Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster.

Information: - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - St George's Channel is a sea channel connecting the Irish Sea to the north and the Celtic Sea to the southwest. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland at . It drains the Shannon River Basin which has an area of , one fifth of the area of Ireland. - The Williamite War in Ireland (16881691), meaning \\"war of the two kings\\"was a conflict between Jacobites (supporters of the Catholic King James II of England and Ireland, VII of Scotland) and Williamites (supporters of the Dutch Protestant Prince William of Orange) over who would be monarch of the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of Ireland. It is also called the Jacobite War in Ireland or the WilliamiteJacobite War in Ireland. - Uí Maine, often Anglicised as Hy Many, was one of the oldest and largest kingdoms located in Connacht, Ireland. Its territory of approximately encompassed all of what is now north, east and south County Galway, south and central County Roscommon, an area near County Clare, and at one stage had apparently subjugated land on the east bank of the Shannon, together with the parish of Lusmagh in Offaly. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Kingdom of Ireland (Classical Irish: '; Modern Irish: ') was a client state of the Kingdom of England that existed on Ireland from 1542 until 1800. It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\". - The Kingdom of Scotland was a state in northwest Europe traditionally said to have been founded in 843, which joined with the Kingdom of England to form a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Its territories expanded and shrank, but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England. It suffered many invasions by the English, but under Robert I it fought a successful war of independence and remained a distinct state in the late Middle Ages. In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King of England, joining Scotland with England in a personal union. In 1707, the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union. From the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 (following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472) the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland, bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest. - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation ('). - Athlone was besieged twice during the Williamite War in Ireland ( 1689 -- 91 ) . The town is situated in the centre of Ireland on the River Shannon and commanded the bridge crossing the river into the Jacobite - held province of Connacht . For this reason , it was of key strategic importance . - Ireland has historically been divided into four provinces: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Irish word for this territorial division, \\"cúige\\", literally meaning \\"fifth part\\", indicates that there were once five; the fifth province, Meath, was incorporated into Leinster, with parts going to Ulster. The provinces of Ireland serve no administrative or political purposes, but function as historical and cultural entities. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - In the Low Countries, stadtholder, literally steward, designated a medieval official and then a national leader. - A Williamite is a follower of King William III of England who deposed King James II in the Glorious Revolution.

Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number.

John William Carson (October 23, 1925 - January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s. From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time. In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s. Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis. In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\" What did he host in Burbank?","completion":"Johnny Carson hosted a television show called \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" in Burbank, California.

Review: Although I had some hopes for this film, particularly since I enjoy the acting of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I must say it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and the Women are also on that list). Yes, there were a couple of laugh out loud moments, although the movie could have been so much better. The premise was not bad- scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they're discovered by someone with a proposition for them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikable, that I didn't care about any of them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him- he wasn't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the movie was hard to follow-- it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which. Only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists-- showing their schemes would have made for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout. I could go on about the movie's shortcomings, but you get the idea.

Meyer is best known for his work on The Simpsons, where he led the group script rewrite sessions. He has been publicly credited with \\"thoroughly shap[ing]...the comedic sensibility\\" of the show. Raised in Tucson, Meyer attended Harvard University. Meyer is in a relationship with the writer Maria Semple. They lived together during the 1990s and broke up in 1999, but later got back together. Their child, named Poppy Valentina after Valentina Tereshkova, was born in 2003; being a father gave Meyer a \\"sense of hopefulness\\". They live in Seattle. Although raised a Catholic, Meyer hated it and later became agnostic. While working at The Simpsons he became an atheist, taking the advice of fellow writer Mike Reiss. He is a vegetarian, gambler, collector of space program memorabilia and practices yoga. Meyer is a fan of the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia being the \\"closest thing in Meyer's life to a spiritual figure.\\" His sister Ann is married to Jon Vitti. Meyer has a strong interest in the environment and notes that \\"the only organization that I really care about these days\\" is Conservation International. In 2005, a newly discovered species of moss frogs from Sri Lanka was named Philautus poppiae after Meyer's daughter Poppy, a tribute to Meyer's and Semple's dedication to the Global Amphibian Assessment.

It does not specifically refer to a place where mailboxes are sold. Option B (front yard) refers to the location where a mailbox is usually installed but not a place to get a mailbox itself. Option C (obesity) is completely unrelated to mailboxes and has no connection to the question at hand. Option D (post office) is not ideal as well, although it might seem relevant due to the association with mail and postal services.

Article: Imagine putting some bacteria in the freezer and taking them out millions of years later to find that they are still alive. That would be similar to what happened recently, when scientists brought eight-million-year-old bacteria back to life -- simply by thawing them out. The ancient bacteria were found frozen in the world's oldest known tracts of ice, the glaciers of Antarctica. Professor Bidle and his colleagues found and revived two samples of bacteria from the glacial ice. The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old. The eight-million-year-old bacteria were alive. But their genes were seriously damaged from long exposure to cosmic ( ) radiation, which is higher at the earth's poles. Most of the bacteria in the samples probably blew over from African deserts, said Paul Falkowski, a scientist at prefix = st1 /RutgersUniversity.

Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. Options: A The birth parents may have indirect contact with the adoptive parents.

Separation at the border: children wait in cages at south Texas warehouse Read more Stephanie Grisham said the first lady believed “we need to be a country that follows all laws”, but also one “that governs with heart”. She added: “Mrs Trump … hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.” Former first lady Laura Bush has made a similar plea, writing in the Washington Post that a zero-tolerance policy was “cruel” and “immoral”. But unlike Melania Trump, Bush placed responsibility firmly on the Trump administration’s policy, not “both sides”. “The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders,” she wrote. Play Video 1:38 US immigration protests as hundreds of children held in Texas facility – video Melania Trump’s intervention came as reports emerged of children being held in cages at a warehouse in Texas after being separated from their parents. One cage had 20 children inside. By blaming “both sides”, Melania Trump effectively endorsed her husband’s false claim that Democrats are responsible for his administration’s practice of separating parents and children. The administration announced its “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy in April and has publicly defended the practice as a vital tool for deterring unauthorized migration across the southern border. Conditions for children separated from their parents or arriving alone and being held in secure facilities were reported by media briefly allowed into the facility by the US border patrol. But Donald Trump’s secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Neilsen, criticised what she called “misreporting” by politicians and the press. Elaborating on her statement that “we do not have a policy of separating families at the border”, she tweeted: “DHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs, traffickers, criminals and abuse. We have continued the policy from previous administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between ‘family’ members, or if the adult has broken a law.” Play Video 1:15 Kellyanne Conway: 'Nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers' arms' – video A chorus of Trump’s allies have joined in criticising the policy , including the Reverend Franklin Graham, who called it “disgraceful”, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who said it was not “the Christian way” or “the American way”, and Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who said: “President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call.” Meanwhile the outgoing UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, called the separations “unconscionable”. According to DHS figures, since the announcement of the “zero tolerance” policy by the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families. 2,000 children separated from parents in six weeks under Trump policy Read more There is no law mandating separation of families. But White House policy is to maximize criminal prosecutions of people caught trying to enter the US illegally. That means more adults are jailed, pending trial, so children are removed from them. Before the Trump policy, many without a criminal record were referred for civil deportation, which generally did not break up families. Amid outcry, Donald Trump has stuck to the untrue claim that Democrats are to blame. On Saturday, the president tweeted: “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November …” Trump has repeatedly referred to a Democratic law. He appears to be referring to one enacted in 2008 that was signed by a Republican president, George W Bush. It was focused on freeing and helping children who come to the border without a parent or guardian and did not call for family separation. Quick guide Why are families being separated at US border? Show Hide Why are children being separated from their families? In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents. Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017. More than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice. What happens to the children? They are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US. This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children. Can these children be reunited with their parents? Immigration advocacy groups and attorneys have warned that there is not a clear system in place to reunite families. In one case, attorneys in Texas said they had been given a phone number to help parents locate their children, but it ended up being the number for an immigration enforcement tip line. Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them. What happened to families before? When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families. This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. By Amanda Holpuch Read more The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics warned this week that forcibly separating children from their parents is a traumatic experience that will cause “irreparable harm”. On Sunday, the senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told NBC’s Meet the Press: “As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience … I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.” Conway echoed Trump in saying Democrats must negotiate over immigration reform and border security. But when NBC host Chuck Todd said it “sounds like you’re holding the kids hostage to get the Democrats to the table”, Conway objected “very forcefully” and said: “I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage.” That was not what an unnamed White House official told the Washington Post this week, saying: “The thinking in the building is to force people to the table.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest People who’ve been taken into custody related to cases of illegal entry into the United States, sit in one of the cages at a facility in McAllen, Texas, on Sunday 17 June.

This is on all of us.” O’Rourke organized a march to Tornillo, Texas, and what has been described as a “tent structure” for 16- and 17-year-olds. • This article was amended on 20 June 2018 to correct the spelling of Anthony Scaramucci’s last name from Scaramuicci. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

And it is contrary to our values in this country.” Former President Bill Clinton likewise spoke out, suggesting that Mr. Trump was using the widely denounced practice to leverage Democrats into accepting immigration limits in legislation they would otherwise oppose. “These children should not be a negotiating tool,” he wrote on Twitter. “And reuniting them with their families would reaffirm America’s belief in & support for all parents who love their children.” Hillary Clinton retweeted that message, adding, “YES!” Contrary to the president’s public statements, no law requires families to necessarily be separated at the border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s “zero tolerance” announcement this spring that the government will prosecute all unlawful immigrants as criminals set up a situation in which children are removed when their parents are taken into federal custody. Previous administrations made exceptions to such prosecutions for adults traveling with minor children, but the Trump administration has said it will not do so. While the president has blamed Democrats, his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, told The New York Times last week that it was “a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, period.” But Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, rejected responsibility for the separations in a series of tweets on Sunday. “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border,” she wrote. “Period.” She distinguished between asylum seekers who try to enter the country at designated points of entry and those who arrive at other parts of the border. “For those seeking asylum at ports of entry, we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between ‘family’ members, or if the adult has broken a law,” she wrote. ||||| Laura Bush is a former first lady of the United States. On Sunday, a day we as a nation set aside to honor fathers and the bonds of family, I was among the millions of Americans who watched images of children who have been torn from their parents. In the six weeks between April 19 and May 31, the Department of Homeland Security has sent nearly 2,000 children to mass detention centers or foster care. More than 100 of these children are younger than 4 years old. The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders. I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart. Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These images are eerily reminiscent of the internment camps for U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. We also know that this treatment inflicts trauma; those who have been interned have been twice as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who were not interned. Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation, on being the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places devastated by natural disasters or famine or war. We pride ourselves on believing that people should be seen for the content of their character, not the color of their skin. We pride ourselves on acceptance. If we are truly that country, then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents — and to stop separating parents and children in the first place. People on all sides agree that our immigration system isn’t working, but the injustice of zero tolerance is not the answer. I moved away from Washington almost a decade ago, but I know there are good people at all levels of government who can do better to fix this. Recently, Colleen Kraft, who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics, visited a shelter run by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. She reported that while there were beds, toys, crayons, a playground and diaper changes, the people working at the shelter had been instructed not to pick up or touch the children to comfort them. Imagine not being able to pick up a child who is not yet out of diapers. Twenty-nine years ago, my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, visited Grandma’s House, a home for children with HIV/AIDS in Washington. Back then, at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis, the disease was a death sentence, and most babies born with it were considered “untouchables.” During her visit, Barbara — who was the first lady at the time — picked up a fussy, dying baby named Donovan and snuggled him against her shoulder to soothe him. My mother-in-law never viewed her embrace of that fragile child as courageous. She simply saw it as the right thing to do in a world that can be arbitrary, unkind and even cruel. She, who after the death of her 3-year-old daughter knew what it was to lose a child, believed that every child is deserving of human kindness, compassion and love. In 2018, can we not as a nation find a kinder, more compassionate and more moral answer to this current crisis? I, for one, believe we can. |||||Summary:","completion":"Melania Trump’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, has said the first lady “hates to see children separated from their families.” It appeared to be a rare public statement at odds with her husband’s policy of separating children from their parents at the Mexico border.

Phil Mickelson, aka Lefty, is thinking of leaving California and perhaps America because, according to his own reckoning, he is facing tax rates of 62% or 63%.

Paragraph: The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

As of 2016, 40 years after their formation, they continue to perform. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille. - Charles Edward Anderson \\"Chuck\\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - A novelty song is a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. - \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\", from the live side of the album, was edited to approximately 4 minutes for release as a single. It was Berry's first and only single to reach number 1 in both the US and the UK. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - Tin Pan Alley is the name given to the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and a plaque exists (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage girls who are aspiring models (Birkin and Hills) ask to speak with him, but the photographer drives off to look at an antiques shop. Wandering into Maryon Park, he takes photos of two lovers. The woman (Redgrave) is furious at being photographed. The photographer then meets his agent for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, Redgrave arrives asking for the film, but he deliberately hands her a different roll. She in turn writes down a false telephone number to give to him.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".

It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.

This situation displays that Cameron is facing a challenge and needs assistance, which indicates that they are not immune to difficulties and hardships that life presents. The water crisis has forced them to rely on their friend Sydney's water well to fulfill their basic needs. The dependency on Sydney's water well reveals that Cameron is resourceful and adaptable, as they have sought out an alternative solution to their problem. It also suggests that they have a trusting and supportive relationship with Sydney, which implies that Cameron values cooperation and friendship in times of crisis. However, it is essential not to overlook the fact that Cameron could also be seen as someone who has benefited from the help provided by others, like Sydney, in this particular context. While Cameron is indeed going through hard times, they have the advantage of having friends who are willing to lend a helping hand. Consequently, they might also be seen as fortunate in the aspect of having a strong support network, although they are concurrently, enduring a difficult situation. In summary, describing Cameron as someone going through hard times seems the most fitting, considering the water shortage problem they are facing at home. While the additional support from friends like Sydney has undeniably helped Cameron, the primary focus should be on their current struggles and their ability to overcome them, which highlights their resilience and adaptability in adverse circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: My love affair with technology began at an early age. On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

This break offers people a chance to relax, socialize, and recharge their energy, while enjoying delicious and satisfying food. The environment in which lunch is consumed greatly impacts the overall experience. A clean, comfortable, and well-lit environment helps to create a sense of relaxation and tranquility.

Q: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. According to the above context, answer the following question. What type of student was Billie Jo?

Answer a question about this article: In the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, who supported the Slavs fighting their Avar rulers, became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe, which, however, most probably did not outlive its founder and ruler. This provided the foundation for subsequent Slavic states to arise on the former territory of this realm with Carantania being the oldest of them.

Thursday is an American post-hardcore band, formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1997. The band consists of Geoff Rickly (lead vocals), Tom Keeley (lead guitar, backing vocals), Steve Pedulla (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Tim Payne (bass guitar), Andrew Everding (keyboards, backing vocals), and Tucker Rule (drums). Thursday released their debut album, Waiting, in late 1999 with original guitarist Bill Henderson, who left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Steve Pedulla. The band gained popularity with the release of their second album, Full Collapse, in 2001, and released their third album and major label debut, War All the Time, in 2003, which reached number seven on the US Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. In fall 2005, five Thursday demo songs were stolen from the iPod of the tour manager for My American Heart, a band Rickly had recently collaborated with for their song \\"We Are the Fabrication\\". The band issued a statement on their official website stating that they were disappointed the unfinished products leaked, but that they were glad that people take that much interest in their music. The band confirmed the title of one demo, \\"At This Velocity\\" and promised it would make their upcoming album. Three other songs (\\"The Other Side of the Crash/Over and Out (Of Control)\\", \\"Telegraph Avenue Kiss\\", and \\"Autumn Leaves Revisited\\") would also make the album, while the remaining demo would later become the song \\"Last Call\\" on their fifth studio album, Common Existence. Thursday had originally toyed with the idea of a double album to follow up War All the Time but the idea was scrapped, reporting on their website that they believed \\"not even The Beatles could properly fill two discs with enough worthy material\\". Thursday released their fourth album and second major label release, A City by the Light Divided, on May 2, 2006, on Island Records in the US and Hassle Records in the United Kingdom. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann, becoming Thursday's first full-length album not produced by Sal Villanueva. The title was created by Geoff Rickly by combining two lines from the poem Sunstone by Octavio Paz. The album was available for preview on the band's MySpace page on April 18, 2006, two weeks before it was officially released. A City by the Light Divided was generally received well by critics, spawning two singles: \\"Counting 5-4-3-2-1\\" and \\"At This Velocity\\", though the latter received considerably less attention. The band left Island Records in early 2007. At their 2007 New Year's Eve show at the Starland Ballroom, the band announced that they will be writing and recording new material in 2008. During a private show they performed on May 3, 2007 in New York City, long-time friend and artist manager, David \\"Rev\\" Ciancio proposed to his fiancee on stage.

Does the sentence \\"Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist.\\" answer the question \\"What famous Greek author did Athanasius quote?\\" Pick from: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(B). No. The sentence \\"Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist.\\" does indicate that Athanasius quotes the famous Greek author Homer, but it does not fully answer the question because it lacks important details, and the sentence itself is not complete. A more detailed response should contain information about the instances when Athanasius quotes Homer, which specific works from Athanasius' bibliography Homer can be found in, and any relevant analysis in regard to the context and implications of these quotations. These details would allow the answer to be comprehensive and well-supported, allowing the person asking the question to have a fuller understanding of the subject matter at hand. Athanasius, a prominent theologian and Church Father of the fourth century, was a prolific writer who greatly impacted the development of Christian doctrine. Although primarily remembered for his critical role in promoting the doctrine of the Trinity and fighting against Arianism, Athanasius' works encompass diverse aspects of theology and biblical interpretation. Among these works, there are indeed instances where Athanasius quotes the famous Greek author Homer. Specifically, Athanasius uses Homer's writings to illustrate different points in his arguments or to provide literary examples. This indicates that Athanasius was familiar with and respected the significant contributions of Homer to the literary and cultural development of ancient Greece. In Athanasius' later works, such as his \\"History of the Arians (Hist. Arian.),\\" he quotes Homer to show the absurdity of Arianism and its divergence from traditional Christian beliefs. He compares Arians to the lying dream mentioned in \\"The Iliad\\" and uses this quote to exemplify false teachings. Additionally, in \\"Against the Pagans (Contra Gentes),\\" Athanasius quotes \\"The Odyssey\\" to demonstrate the futility of idol worship among the ancient Greeks and to emphasize the superiority of Christian belief. These examples not only illustrate Athanasius' engagement with the works of Homer but also showcase the ways in which he incorporated Greek literature into his theological and polemical arguments. In conclusion, while the original sentence does mention that Athanasius quotes Homer, a more detailed response would provide an in-depth discussion of the context and significance of these quotations. By doing so, this answer offers a broader understanding of how Athanasius utilized the works of the famous Greek author Homer in his later writings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar.\\", does this mean that \\"The man is playing an electric guitar.\\"? Options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"3). No. The statement \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar.\\" clearly mentions that the man is playing an acoustic guitar. An acoustic guitar is a type of string instrument that uses a hollow body to amplify the vibrations of the strings, producing sound. This type of guitar is distinct from an electric guitar, which requires an electronic amplification system to amplify the sound of the string vibrations. In contrast, an electric guitar relies on electronic pickups and an amplifier to generate sound. Electric guitars are typically solid-bodied and do not have the hollow cavity of an acoustic guitar, allowing the electric guitar to be played at higher volumes without the risk of feedback issues that can be experienced with hollow-bodied acoustic guitars when amplified. Since the initial statement clearly mentions that the man is playing an acoustic guitar, we cannot conclude that he is playing an electric guitar. The two types of guitars are different in terms of their design, sound production, and playing techniques. Therefore, the correct answer to the question of whether the man is playing an electric guitar based on the given statement is \\"No.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select the topic that this about: As the Palestinians #39; main donor and Israel #39;s top commercial partner, Europe could be a major player in pushing to restart the stalled Middle East peace process in the post-Yasser Arafat era.","completion":"The role of Europe in the Middle East peace process in the post-Yasser Arafat era involves a delicate balance between diplomacy and financial support for both the Palestinians and Israelis. Europe, particularly the European Union (EU), is in a unique position to exert influence and facilitate negotiations due to its long-standing relationship with both parties. As the Palestinians' main donor and Israel's top commercial partner, Europe has both the leverage and the resources to contribute to peacemaking efforts in the Middle East. In the post-Yasser Arafat era, Europe's role in pushing for the revitalization of the peace process can be explored through several avenues: 1. Financial Aid: Europe, primarily through the European Union, has been a significant financial contributor to the Palestinian Authority and other humanitarian organizations operating in the region. This financial support enables Europe to use its economic influence to encourage political changes and negotiations. It also funds development projects that, if designed and implemented conscientiously, can contribute to laying the groundwork for peace through improved living conditions and promoting economic growth among Palestinians. 2. Diplomatic Efforts: European leaders can engage in diplomatic efforts with both sides, promoting dialogue and offering their services as mediators. Regular meetings with Palestinian and Israeli officials can facilitate conversations that help resolve misunderstandings and find common ground. Furthermore, Europe can establish tracks for dialogue and coordinate efforts with other international actors, such as the United States and Russia. 3. Political Pressure: Europe can use its close relationship with Israel to apply political pressure on the Israeli government to reengage in the peace process and take concrete steps towards a resolution. These measures may include halting or limiting settlement expansion in the West Bank, easing restrictions on the movement of goods and people in the Palestinian territories, and entering negotiations with more flexibility. 4. Encouraging Palestinian Unity: Europe should work towards promoting unity among Palestinian factions, such as Fatah and Hamas. By helping to create a unified Palestinian government, Europe can provide a solid partner for negotiations and facilitate progress in the peace process. This effort may involve promoting dialogue between factions, supporting democratic reforms, and offering financial incentives for cooperation. 5. Confidence-Building Measures: The EU and individual European countries can support confidence-building measures to improve relations and facilitate a more productive dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. This can be done through cultural exchange programs, academic partnerships, joint economic projects, and other cooperative initiatives that encourage interaction and mutual understanding between both parties. 6. Supporting Civil Society Initiatives: Europe can work alongside civil society organizations in promoting peace, reconciliation, and tolerance in the region. By helping to fund grassroots initiatives and acting as a resource, European actors can support local efforts to change the status quo and foster dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli civilians. 7. Advocating for a Two-State Solution: Europe must continue to advocate for a two-state solution and the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian state alongside Israel. Supporting the establishment of such a state is crucial for both the Palestinians and the long-term security of Israel. Europe can use its diplomatic and economic influence to promote this vision and bolster support for it internationally. In conclusion, Europe has a critical role to play in the post-Yasser Arafat era to restart the stalled Middle East peace process. As the Palestinians' main donor and Israel's top commercial partner, Europe has the leverage and resources needed to encourage negotiations and facilitate progress. By utilizing its strategic partnerships, diplomatic resources, financial aid, and political influence, Europe can set the stage for renewed engagement in the peace process and promote lasting peace and stability in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is important treatment, and you need to feel comfortable. If you have just been diagnosed with a mental illness and are beginning your treatment, you should find people in your life to provide support. This can be a scary and confusing time in your life, and you shouldn't do it alone. Choose people you can trust or count on to help you.

You are given a new situation: John spends most of his time on computers. While at work his work computer does not need modern capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system. and a hint : In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms. Please answer this question : Does John's home computer have less complex or more complex CPU power saving methods? Answer:","completion":"John's home computer has more complex CPU power saving methods. This is because he uses the latest version of Windows on his home computer, whereas he uses Windows 2000 on his work computer. As stated in the hint, later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods, which involve calling routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the politician's son get the money to pay for the alcohol? ? Bradley \\"B-Rad\\" Gluckman is a 23 year old upperclass, privileged white man from Malibu, with aspirations of being \\"the biggest rapper that ever was\\". B-Rad dresses and speaks like a gangster and essentially talks and acts like he is black. His father, Bill Gluckman, is running for governor of California. After Bill's campaign manager Tom Gibbons gets irritated with B-Rad's constant interruptions with the election, Bill decides that B-Rad must see a psychiatrist, Dr. Feldman. B-Rad explains to Feldman that when he was a kid, his parents were hardly ever around so he got hooked on the music his black caretaker listened to, and dreamt of being a rapper ever since. Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess that B-Rad has the most serious case of \\"gangstaphrienia\\" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ and Sean James to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra, they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto. Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go. B-Rad tries to tell Shondra he cannot, it is who he is. The actors then try plan B, forcing B-Rad to rob a convenience store owned by a Korean American family. After sending B-Rad end, however, Sean and PJ then realize they forgot to call and tell the shop owner that the robbery was fake and they begin to worry the plan will get out of hand and/or fail, possibly ending with them in jail. B-Rad finds his emergency stash of cash in his pants and pays for the alcohol he was supposed to steal for the two gangsters. B-Rad lies to them and says he stole it. When they find a receipt in the back, B-Rad says he stole that, too.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In abstract algebra, more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group. For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid. The natural numbers N (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication (Z ∖ {0}, ·), see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as (Q ∖ {0}, ·) is derived from (Z ∖ {0}, ·), known as the Grothendieck group. Groupoids are similar to groups except that the composition a • b need not be defined for all a and b. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in topological and analytical structures, such as the fundamental groupoid or stacks. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary n-ary one (i.e. an operation taking n arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an n-ary group. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Axioms are defined by relaxing what?","completion":"In abstract algebra, axioms are defined by relaxing some of the conditions or properties that define a given algebraic structure, such as a group. In the context of the question, by \\"relaxing\\" an axiom, it means that one or more of the defining properties of a group are either weakened or removed to create a more general structure. For example, in the case of a monoid, the requirement that every element has an inverse is relaxed, or, in other words, this requirement is removed. This creates a more general algebraic structure compared to a group, since it allows for the existence of elements that do not have a corresponding inverse. Another example mentioned in the question is a groupoid. In groupoids, the composition a • b is not required to be defined for all elements a and b, which relaxes the closure property of a group. These more generalized structures allow mathematicians to study different types of algebraic objects and explore a wider range of symmetries and relationships among elements in various mathematical contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion? is inside the article: Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written.

On tärkeää hahmottaa, että kansainvälisten rahoituslaitosten (IFI) toimilla voi olla kauaskantoisia vaikutuksia Euroopan unionin sisäisiin sosiaalisiin, taloudellisiin ja poliittisiin kysymyksiin. Joitakin läksyjä voidaan oppia IFI-aloitteiden onnistumisista, joita voidaan soveltaa muihin unionin alueisiin, joilla on yhteisön marginaalisten tilojen ja jännitteiden alue. Yksi keskeinen oppitunti on merkitys osallistavista prosesseista, jotka koskevat kaikkia paikallisia toimijoita. Kuten IFI-aloitteet ovat osoittaneet, erilaisten yhteisöjen, etnisten ryhmien, kansalaisyhteiskunnan järjestöjen ja koulutuslaitosten yhteistyö voi olla ratkaisevaa yhteisön jännitteiden lievittämisessä ja integraation edistämisessä. Tämän strategian levittäminen muihin unionin kriisipesäkkeisiin voi olla avainasemassa kyseisten alueiden vakauden varmistamisessa ja yhteistyön luomisessa erilaisten ryhmien välille. Toinen tärkeä kokemus IFI-aloitteista on taloudellinen tuki ja resurssien kohdentaminen yhteiskunnan kaikkein altteimmille osille. Tämä voi tarkoittaa paitsi investointeja infrastruktuuriin, myös inhimillisen pääoman kehittämistä koulutuksen ja valmiuksien lisäämisen avulla. Näitä ohjelmia voidaan soveltaa myös muihin unionin alueisiin, joilla on suuri syrjäytymisen vaara, esimerkiksi alueellisia kehitysprojekteja ja työllisyysmahdollisuuksien parantamiseksi tähtääviä ohjelmia. Kolmas tärkeä oppitunti on tehokas seuranta- ja arviointimekanismien käyttöönotto. IFI-aloitteiden vaikutusten analyysi ja menestyksen mittarit voivat antaa tärkeää tietoa siitä, mitkä toimet toimivat parhaiten yhteisön marginaalisten ryhmien auttamiseksi ja mitkä eivät. Tämän tiedon perusteella voidaan luoda parhaat käytännöt, joita voidaan soveltaa laajemmin Euroopan unionissa. Neljäs aihealue on tarve keskittyä paitsi pitkän aikavälin kestävään kehitykseen myös lyhyen aikavälin väliintuloihin, jotka voivat helpottaa yhteisön jännitteitä ja tukea yhtenäisyyttä. IFI-aloitteet ovat toimineet monitasoisesti, ja niiden tavoitteena on ollut paitsi taloudellisen vakauden saavuttaminen myös yhteisön rakenteiden ja suhteiden vahvistaminen. Tämä lähestymistapa voi olla hyödyllinen muidenkin sosiaalisten ja taloudellisten haasteiden ratkaisemisessa. Lopuksi on tärkeää, että EU tunnistaa ja tunnustaa IFI-aloitteiden menestystarinat ja pyrkii levittämään näitä oivalluksia muihin marginaalisia alueita ja yhteisöjä koskeviin politiikkoihin. Näin voidaan varmistaa, että unioni onnistuu edistämään sosiaalista ja taloudellista osallisuutta laajemmalla tasolla ja luomaan kestävän perustan yhtenäisyydelle ja yhteistyölle tulevaisuudessa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Die Hard stands out among contemporary films reliant on CGI and wire-rigged fights, opting for old-fashioned fist fights and well-executed stunts. The 80s-style action is praised as enjoyable and a fun element that makes the film entertaining. Live Free or Die Hard is hailed for capturing the essence of traditional action films, providing an experience close to reliving the classic '80s action films. Amidst all the gunfire and high-stake situations, the repetitiveness of the action sequences eventually made them more predictable, causing some viewers to become more critical and analyze the scenes instead of being fully immersed. Despite the over-the-top nature of the film, it is regarded as a fun, adrenaline-fueled rampage that'll keep viewers entertained. The film is described as being highly implausible, similar to a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The unrealistic action sequences, such as Bruce Willis' character leaping onto fighter jets and defeating helicopters with launched police cars, may be unconvincing to some, but action fans are expected to overlook these aspects in favor of the explosions and high-octane stunts. While certain plot flaws may detract from the experience, the ride provided by Live Free or Die Hard is generally seen as enjoyable and engaging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He grew up in an eight-story house at 10 West 54th Street, the tallest private residence ever built in the city. Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. Context: Rockefeller traveled widely and met with both foreign rulers and U.S. presidents, beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower. At times he served as an unofficial emissary on high-level business. Among the foreign leaders he met were Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1968, he declined an offer from his brother Nelson Rockefeller, then governor of New York, to appoint him to Robert F. Kennedy's Senate seat after Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968, a post Nelson also offered to their nephew John Davison \\"Jay\\" Rockefeller IV. President Jimmy Carter offered him the position of United States Secretary of the Treasury but he declined. Rockefeller was criticized for befriending foreign autocrats in order to expand Chase interests in their countries. The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002 that Rockefeller \\"spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did.\\" He noted that Rockefeller had cut profitable deals with \\"oil-rich dictators\\", \\"Soviet party bosses\\" and \\"Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution\\". Rockefeller met Henry Kissinger in 1954, when Kissinger was appointed a director of a seminal Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear weapons, of which David Rockefeller was a member. He named Kissinger to the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and consulted with him frequently, with the subjects including the Chase Bank's interests in Chile and the possibility of the election of Salvador Allende in 1970. Rockefeller supported his \\"opening of China\\" initiative in 1971 as it afforded banking opportunities for the Chase Bank. Though a lifelong Republican and party contributor, he was a member of the moderate \\"Rockefeller Republicans\\" that arose out of the political ambitions and public policy stance of his brother Nelson. In 2006 he teamed up with former Goldman Sachs executives and others to form a fund-raising group based in Washington, Republicans Who Care, that supported moderate Republican candidates over more ideological contenders. Question: What else happened with his relationship with Kissinger?. Whats the answer?","completion":"David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger had a close relationship. They first met in 1954, and over the years, they worked together on many projects and discussed various topics. Rockefeller trusted Kissinger's opinions and advice on foreign affairs, banking, and politics. When Kissinger became a well-known political figure, Rockefeller continued to support him. He even helped Kissinger to get some important positions, like being part of the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. They also discussed important events like opening up China for banking opportunities in 1971. Their relationship was strong because they both cared about world affairs and wanted to make good decisions for their businesses and their country. They remained friends throughout their lives, always supporting and helping each other in different ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly. This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages. Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Answer:","completion":"In this scenario, it can be inferred that Norm, who read about the mini-Ice ages, learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing in comparison to Tim, who read about the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect is directly related to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, and their role in trapping energy in the form of terrestrial radiation. An increase in greenhouse gases leads to an increase in trapped terrestrial radiation, which results in a rise in global temperatures. Therefore, Tim, who studied the Greenhouse Effect, would have gained more knowledge about the increasing amount of trapped terrestrial radiation and its correlation with greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature changes. On the other hand, Norm read about mini-Ice ages. Mini-Ice ages refer to periods in Earth's history when global temperatures were significantly colder than average for an extended duration, often caused by factors like reduced solar radiation and fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. While these periods might involve changes in the atmospheric composition, they primarily focus on the cooling effect on Earth and are not directly related to the mechanisms of trapped terrestrial radiation and its increase. Hence, in comparison to Tim, Norm learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing, as his study focused on mini-Ice ages which highlight colder periods in Earth's history rather than the trapping of radiation due to greenhouse gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Typically, tornadoes have a short lifespan and spend mere minutes on the ground, but the Manitoba tornado persisted for nearly three hours, echoing the destructive force of the historic Tri-State tornado of 1925, which holds the record at a staggering three-and-a-half hours. USA Today reported on this extreme weather event, highlighting comparisons to the Tri-State tornado that had devastated parts of the US Midwest nearly a century ago. While the damage caused by the Manitoba tornado was substantial, no casualties or injuries were reported. Environment Canada is yet to provide a final assessment of the tornado, according to the Winnipeg Free Press. Fortuitously, the Manitoba tornado avoided hitting any towns while it tore through the province. However, it left a path of destruction in its wake, taking down utility poles, uprooting trees, and damaging roads in rural areas. The storm's intensity was so strong that portions of Highway 256 in the southwest part of the province had asphalt ripped from the road's surface. Canadian storm chaser Greg Johnson spoke to the CBC after witnessing the tornado firsthand: \\"The wind intensity was so strong that there were parts of Highway 256 in the southwest part of the province that literally had the asphalt stripped off the road's surface. I'm still on an adrenalin kick right now, I'm not gonna lie.\\" The Manitoba tornado serves as a stark reminder of the immense power of natural disasters and the potential for increased severity in extreme weather events. As climate change continues to affect global weather patterns, it is essential to enhance our understanding of these potentially catastrophic events and develop strategies that can help communities prepare for and minimize damages from such occurrences in the future. In light of the Manitoba tornado and the increasing frequency of similar events witnessed in recent years, government and research institutions should invest more resources in analyzing these phenomena. Greater investment in weather prediction and monitoring technologies can aid researchers in both understanding and anticipating severe weather events. Consequently, advanced warning systems will be instrumental in allowing communities to prepare and protect themselves from the devastating impact of these natural disasters. Despite the destruction and devastation caused by the Manitoba tornado, the lack of injuries and fatalities stands as a testament to the importance of effective warning systems and increased public awareness surrounding the dangers of severe weather events. As the world progresses to confront the challenges posed by climate change, continued investment in technology, research, and public education can help mitigate the effects and potential devastation caused by these extreme weather events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While Vipul Shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of WAQT that is based on something as conceivable as a father-son relationship. Adopted from a Gujarati play Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up. A mature look on the father-son relationship, a father's unconditional love towards his son and a son's responsibility towards his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan) who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor-made and spoon-fed in life. Ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more. Aditya dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true. In the meanwhile he marries his ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life. The endurance limit finally collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his house. The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles Aditya. He has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid. He starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows. The story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son. If you are not one of the two, you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life. Add to it director Vipul Shah's easy handling of the screenplay. With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker. However Shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film. Clear-cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre-interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner. The purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences' brains. Ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation. That's what differentiates WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment. But after gaining all the distinction points, one may wonder where does WAQT still fail in? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT distinguishes itself from the others in it's league in terms of treatment, it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging. What with the director forcing in song-n-dance every now and then in the first half. There's a Johar kinda shaadi song, a Chopra kinda Holi song, a father son disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer. Picture this... the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Out of reason! and the audience Out of seat. The film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either. However Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (unintentionally) hilarious histrionic. Add to it the climax set at the finals of the star-hunt where the son bursts out with emotions. That's so archetypal! Also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son. Anu Malik's music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera-work is competent enough though not much demanding. Aatish Kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments. Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently. While Rajpal Yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately, this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained. His deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with Boman's over-the-top histrionics. Shefali Shah is convincing in the mother's role. Not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and 'looking' her character. Priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well. Of course the major applause deserves are Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities. Though Bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes, his brilliance strikes throughout the film. To sum up, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isn't as much appetizing. What is the sentiment of this review?

Background: Jackass is an American reality series, originally shown on MTV from 2000 to 2002, featuring people performing various dangerous, crude, self-injuring stunts and pranks. The show served as a launchpad for the television and acting careers of Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, and Steve-O, who previously had only minor acting roles. The show later sparked several spin-offs including Wildboyz, Viva La Bam, Homewrecker, Bam's Unholy Union, and Dr. Steve-O as well as three feature films distributed by MTV corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Jackass sparked considerable amounts of controversy, as it was seen as indecent and encouraging of dangerous behavior. Context: Since the first episode, Jackass frequently featured warnings and disclaimers noting that the stunts performed were dangerous and should not be imitated, and that recordings of any stunts would not be aired on MTV. Such warnings not only appeared before and after each program and after each commercial break, but also in a \\"crawl\\" that ran along the bottom of the screen during some especially risky stunts, as well as showing their \\"skull and crutches\\" logo at the bottom right of the screen to symbolize the stunt performed as risky. Nevertheless, the program has been blamed for a number of deaths and injuries involving teens and children recreating the stunts. Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman followed up with a February 7, 2001 letter to MTV's parent company Viacom urging the company to take greater responsibility for its programming and do more to help parents protect their children. MTV responded to the criticism by canceling all airings of Jackass before 10 p.m., but Lieberman's continual campaign against the show led to MTV refusing to air repeats of the later episodes, a move which angered the cast and production crew of the series who were furious with MTV's \\"caving into Lieberman's demands\\". A man named Jack Ass sued MTV for 10 million, claiming the series was plagiarizing his name. Jack Ass, formerly known as Bob Craft, changed his name in 1997 to raise awareness for drunk driving, after his brother and friend were killed in a vehicle accident. Matt-Dillion Shannon, an 18-year-old from Napier, New Zealand, was sentenced on November 23, 2012 to three years in prison on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm for his role in the August 2011 dousing of a 16-year-old with gasoline and setting him alight. Shannon's lawyer claimed that this act was inspired by the Jackass series, despite the fact that no such stunt ever aired on the show. Question: Did people have to be warned about the show? Answer:","completion":"Yes, people had to be warned about the show Jackass due to the dangerous, crude, self-injuring stunts, and pranks performed by the cast. These warnings and disclaimers were intended to inform viewers that the stunts were hazardous and should not be imitated, and that recordings of such stunts would not be aired on MTV. The warnings appeared at various points throughout the show, including before and after the program, after commercial breaks, and during some particularly risky stunts. These measures were implemented to discourage viewers, particularly young people, from attempting to recreate the stunts and potentially harming themselves. Despite these warnings, however, the show still faced controversies and was associated with several injuries and deaths involving individuals who attempted to replicate the stunts."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sentence 2: Before 1911, the Ottoman vilayet of Tripolitania (the \`\`kingdom of Tripoli'') included much of the same territory as modern Libya. Step 1: Compare the main subject and time frame: Both sentences are talking about the Ottoman Vilayet of Tripolitania (or the \\"kingdom of Tripoli\\") before 1911. Step 2: Compare the main verbs: In Sentence 1, the verb used is \\"encompassed,\\" while in Sentence 2, the verb used is \\"included.\\" Step 3: Compare the objects of the main verbs: Both sentences are referring to \\"much of the same territory as modern Libya.\\" Step 4: Determine if the main verbs convey the same meaning: The verb \\"encompass\\" means to surround or include comprehensively, whereas the verb \\"include\\" means to comprise (something) as a part of a whole. Although these verbs have slightly different connotations, in this context, they are close in meaning. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of their structure, wording, and verbs' meanings in context, these two sentences essentially convey the same information. They both mean that before 1911, the territory of the Ottoman Vilayet of Tripolitania (or the \\"kingdom of Tripoli\\") was similar to the territory of modern Libya."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"A man who set up a petition for all children to have the meningitis B vaccine has said he is overwhelmed by the response after more than 640,000 people signed it.\\"","completion":"Title: Over 640,000 Signatures: A Father's Relief and Triumph over Meningitis Vaccine Petition Introduction: As the story goes, it started with a single man's determination to make a difference in the lives of children by trying to make the meningitis B vaccine accessible to all. Little did he know that his efforts would be backed by over 640,000 people, showing the overwhelming support for his campaign. Step 1: Introduce the man behind the petition and his motivation Lee Booth, a concerned father of two from Newcastle, set out on a mission to create a petition calling for the meningitis B vaccine to be readily available to all children. His motivation stemmed from the personal experience of witnessing his 5-year-old daughter, who was not eligible for the vaccine due to her age, suffer from a potentially life-threatening illness. Step 2: Provide background information on the vaccine's availability and restrictions Currently, the meningitis B vaccine is only offered to babies born after May 1, 2015, in the United Kingdom, leaving many children and their families at risk. In order for a petition to be considered for debate in Parliament, a minimum of 100,000 signatures are required. Step 3: Discuss the response to the petition Booth did not anticipate the massive response that his petition would receive. The initiative garnered more than 640,000 signatures, far surpassing the required number for Parliament's attention. The outpouring of support demonstrates the public's concern for children's health and highlights the necessity of broader vaccine accessibility. Step 4: Mention the potential impact of the petition The substantial response to this petition could potentially lead to policy changes and greater accessibility of the vaccine for children. Should the Parliament decide to review the current restrictions on the meningitis B vaccine, many more families may be protected from the disease's devastating effects. Step 5: Address the importance of vaccines and potential benefits Vaccination is vital in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. Extending the meningitis B vaccine's availability to all children could significantly reduce the prevalence of this dangerous illness, lessening the burden on families and the healthcare system. Conclusion: The story of Lee Booth and his meningitis B vaccine petition is a testament to the power of a concerned citizen and the importance of protecting children from preventable diseases. With more than 640,000 supporters, this father's quest for change may be the catalyst for more equitable access to vaccines and a brighter, healthier future for all children."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Smart job-seekers need to rid themselves of several standard myths about interviewing before they start looking for a job. What follows is a list of some of these untruths and some tips to help you do your best at your next interview. Myth 1: The aim of interviewing is to obtain (means \\"get\\") a job offer. Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \\"controls\\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change. Employers will either like or dislike you, but at least you'll have made an impression. Leaving an employer indifferent is the worst impression you can make.

Since 1827, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always simultaneously held the office of Second Lord of the Treasury when that person has not also been the Prime Minister. The official residence of the Second Lord of The Treasury is 11 Downing Street. - Her Majesty's Government (HMG), commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. - Downing Street in London, United Kingdom, has for more than three hundred years housed the official residences of two of the most senior British Cabinet ministers: the First Lord of the Treasury, an office now synonymous with that of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; and the Second Lord of the Treasury, an office held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister's official residence is 10 Downing Street; the Chancellor's official residence is next door at Number 11. The government's Chief Whip has an official residence at Number 12, although the current Chief Whip's residence is at Number 9. - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury. The office is a British Cabinet-level position. - The Chief Whip is a political office in some legislatures whose task is to administer the whipping system that tries to ensure that members of the party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British politics, the Chief Whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. - The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the commission exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom, and is now always also the Prime Minister. This office is not equivalent to the usual position of the \\"Treasurer\\" in other governments; the closer equivalent of a Treasurer in the United Kingdom is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the Second Lord of the Treasury. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. The prime minister (informal abbreviation: PM) and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers, most of whom are government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The office is one of the Great Offices of State. The , Theresa May, leader of the Conservative Party, was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016. - 10 Downing Street, colloquially known in the United Kingdom as Number 10, is the headquarters of Government of the United Kingdom and the official residence and office of the First Lord of the Treasury, a post which, for much of the 18th and 19th centuries and invariably since 1905, has been held by the Prime Minister. - The post of Lord High Treasurer or Lord Treasurer was an English government position and has been a British government position since the Acts of Union of 1707. A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State, below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor. - 11 Downing Street ( commonly known as Number 11 ) , is the official residence of Britain 's Second Lord of the Treasury who is formally recognised as the Chancellor of the Exchequer . The first Chancellor to live there was Henry Petty - Fitzmaurice in 1806 , but Number 11 did not become the Chancellor 's official residence until 1828 . It is currently the official residence of George Osborne , who was appointed as Chancellor by Prime Minister David Cameron on 11 May 2010 .

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was going on in Eastern Europe?\\" is in \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the context mentioned, Eastern Europe, during its historical phase related to the Iranian languages' influence, experienced massive changes due to various socio-linguistic aspects. The changes primarily centered around the geographical regions where Iranian languages were largely spoken. These regions, especially in Eastern Europe, which approximately covers the regions of modern Ukraine, parts of southern European Russia, and areas of the Balkans, witnessed a decisive takeover. This takeover was prompted by the assimilation or absorption, specifically known as Slavicisation, by the Proto-Slavic population. The core region, which was home to the indigenous people like the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans, was significantly impacted due to this assimilation. The transitions were so impactful that by the 6th century AD, this resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once dominant Scythian languages in the region. However, the Proto-Slavic population was not the sole factor responsible for the changes in Eastern Europe's linguistic landscape. There were several other languages like Arabic and Turkic that spread across multiple regions. For instance, Arabic proliferated into some parts of Western Iran (like Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread throughout large parts of Central Asia, replacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in regions that nowadays correspond to countries like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Despite these significant shifts in the linguistic landscape, some small remnants of Iranian languages managed to survive. For instance, Yaghnobi, closely relating to Sogdian, barely survived in a minor part of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand. Similarly, Saka lingered as Ossetic in the Caucasus, becoming the only remnant of the once dominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe and large parts of the North Caucasus. Moreover, there are some small Iranian languages derived from Eastern Iranian that survived in the Pamirs. To sum up, the Eastern European region saw a variety of linguistic changes due to the expansion of several languages, which resulted in the displacement and extinction of certain Iranian languages. However, some traces of Iranian languages managed to survive in specific smaller regions. The assimilation and absorption by the Proto-Slavic population mainly catalyzed these transformations, significantly altering the linguistic makeup of the region as we see today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the given equation -35 = -2*l - 33 for l, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (l) The goal is to get l on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. In this equation, we have -2*l on one side and -35 and -33 on the other side. To isolate l, we need to remove the constant term (-33) from the right side of the equation. Step 2: Add 33 to both sides of the equation To remove -33 from the right side of the equation, we perform the inverse operation, which is addition. So, we add 33 to both sides of the equation: -35 = -2*l - 33 -35 + 33 = -2*l - 33 + 33 After performing the addition, the equation becomes: -2 = -2*l Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -2 Now, we need to get rid of the -2 coefficient in front of l. To do this, we will perform the opposite operation, which is division. Divide both sides of the equation by -2: -2 / (-2) = (-2*l) / (-2) After dividing, the equation becomes: 1 = l So, the value of l is 1 (l = 1)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Foals are a rock band from Oxford, England formed in 2005, consisting of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Yannis Philippakis, drummer and percussionist Jack Bevan, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Smith, and keyboardist Edwin Congreave. They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland. Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London. Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\" According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\" In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows. Holy Fire was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. Q awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while \\"Inhaler\\" received the Best Track award from NME. Not only this, but in a reader-nominated \\"Best Album of 2013\\" poll, Holy Fire topped the list; as did single \\"My Number\\" in a \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll, beating NME favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands.

They believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face. Researchers found that our brains adapt so that we process emoticons as if they were a real face. :P I am sticking out my tongue :^P I am sticking out tongue, and I have a nose B^P I am sticking out tongue, and I have sunglasses:{ I am having a hard time ;-) Winking at you :-D I am laughing happily @}->-- Rose for you (to show affection) |^o I am snoring >:-( I am annoyed. 'Emoticons are a new form of language that we're producing,\\" Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News. 'And to decode that language we've produced a new pattern of brain activity.' The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to 'read' them for emotion. The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons. The team showed 20 participants images of real faces, smiley face. emoticons (involving the use of a colon, hyphen and parenthesis), and a. meaningless string of characters. They used electrophysiology to. determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the. participants viewed the different images, and found we react to. emoticons ion the same way. Emoticons have become massively popular, being used in text message and online conversations, along with art projects such as this Banksy Exhibit. The researchers admit the were stunned by the results. 'There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with. 'Before 1982 there would be no reason that ':-)' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we've learnt that this represents a face,\\" said Churches. 'This is an entirely culturally-created neural response. It's really quite amazing.' One of the earliest appearances of the emoticon appears in an 1862 transcript of a speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The transcript records the audience's response to Lincoln's droll introduction as \\"(applause and laughter ;).\\" However, the modern usage began when a joke about a fake mercury spill at Carnegie Mellon University was posted online and mistake for a genuine warning. Following a debate,on Sept. 19, 1982, faculty member Scott E. Fahlman entered the debate with the following message:. I propose that [sic] the following character sequence for joke markers::-)Read it sideways. Actually, it is probably more economical to mark things that are NOT jokes, given current trends. For this, use::-(. Seperately the yellow smiley face symbol pre-dates and was developed independent;y, although the two have now merged in many people';s minds. A freelance artist called Harvey Ball designed the original yellow smiley face to be used on a button to try and boost morale at a recently merged insurance company. He made 45 for his design, which was eventually adopted by hippy, then rave culture where is appeared n clothing and ectasy tablets. Highlights:","completion":"1. Australian researchers claim that emoticons, such as smiley and sad faces, are changing the way our brain works, as our brains process them similarly to real faces. 2. The use of emoticons triggers parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at human faces, which may be the key to their popularity. 3. Dr. Owen Churches of Flinders University in Adelaide states that emoticons are a new form of language, creating a unique pattern of brain activity when decoding them. 4. The research team used electrophysiology to analyze the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when participants viewed images of real faces, smiley face emoticons, and meaningless strings of characters, discovering that participants reacted to emoticons in the same way as real faces. 5. Emoticons have become increasingly popular in text messages, online conversations, and even art projects. 6. This change in brain activity in response to emoticons is described as entirely culturally-created, with no innate neural response. 7. The modern usage of emoticons began in 1982, following a debate at Carnegie Mellon University, where faculty member Scott E. Fahlman proposed using the character sequences :-) and :-( for marking jokes and non-jokes respectively. 8. Separately, the yellow smiley face symbol predates the emoticon and was developed independently by freelance artist Harvey Ball to boost morale at a recently merged insurance company. The symbol eventually became associated with hippy and rave culture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What is the full name of the person who is alive because a gold coin deflected a bullet? Answer the above question based on the context below: H. L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Army Board is the top single-service management committee of the British Army, and has always been staffed by senior politicians and soldiers. Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military. Between 1855, and 1904, the post did not exist. In March 2013, the holder was titled as \\"Director Land Capability and Transformation\\" but still sat on the Army Board as Master-General of the Ordnance. In September 2013, the post was again eliminated. - Major - General Peter Gilchrist CB ( born 28 February 1952 ) is a former Master - General of the Ordnance . What entity does 'peter gilchrist' has the relation 'military branch' with? Answer:","completion":"Major-General Peter Gilchrist has the relation 'military branch' with the British Army. As a former Master-General of the Ordnance, he held a very senior position within the British military, and was responsible for numerous aspects such as artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals, and more. The British Army, being one of the principal components of the United Kingdom's Armed Forces, allows its personnel to serve on the Army Board, which is the top single-service management committee of the British Army. The Army Board comprises senior politicians and soldiers who are responsible for the strategic direction, administration, and overall management of the British Army. Peter Gilchrist's role as the Master-General of the Ordnance saw him directly involved with the British Army's artillery capabilities, which are large military weapons designed to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Throughout history, artillery has undergone significant development, transitioning from heavy and immobile siege engines deployed for breaching fortifications to lighter, more mobile field artillery for battlefield use. Today, modern self-propelled artillery vehicles serve as highly mobile and versatile weapons, providing a significant proportion of an army's total firepower. In summary, Major-General Peter Gilchrist is associated with the British Army as his 'military branch,' given his prior role as the Master-General of the Ordnance and his involvement in the Army Board, which focuses on the strategic management and oversight of the British Army."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The breastfeeding nipple shield was designed initially for an infant who is having difficulties in latching, or the act of grasping and sucking the mother's nipples and lower areola area. It is important that the baby latches on to achieve maximum breastfeeding potential without friction or other complications. The breastfeeding nipple shield is can also be used if you have flat or inverted nipples. These sort of nipples make it very challenging for a baby to latch on. The shield also provides protection to the infant in case you have a skin diseases such as psoriasis or eczema, especially in the latching area. Using a nipple shield can help prevent the transfer of any of the aforementioned skin diseases from the mother to the infant. Some professionals believe that you should not use a nipple shield if you are not experiencing any of the problems listed above. They hold that the nipple shield will allow your child to get used to a firm nipple which may cause the infant to become confused when you try to feed him with your real nipple. This disorientation that can occur is called nipple teat confusion. The recommended length of time that you should use a nipple shield is generally only 14 to 30 days.","completion":"The breastfeeding nipple shield is a tool designed to aid infants who face challenges in latching properly onto their mother's nipple and lower areola area in order to achieve effective breastfeeding without friction or complications. This device can be particularly helpful for mothers with flat or inverted nipples, which can make it difficult for the baby to latch on. Additionally, the nipple shield offers protection for both the mother and infant in cases where the mother has a skin disease, such as psoriasis or eczema, by preventing the transfer of these conditions from the mother to the baby during breastfeeding. Despite its benefits, some professionals caution against using a nipple shield if the mother does not experience any of the aforementioned issues. This is because the shield presents a firm nipple to the baby, which could cause confusion when the infant is later introduced to the mother's natural nipple, a phenomenon known as nipple teat confusion. To avoid this potential issue, it is generally recommended that a breastfeeding nipple shield be used for a limited time, typically only between 14 to 30 days, as it serves as a temporary solution to address specific breastfeeding challenges in order to achieve the most successful and beneficial breastfeeding experience for both the mother and the infant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806.

The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake (Phyllis Davis), heiress to a family fortune. Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall (Duncan McLeod) discredits them as \\"hippies\\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune himself. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that Z-Man becomes their Svengali-style manager, changing their name to The Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris. Kelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), a high-priced gigolo who has designs on her inheritance. Harris at first fends off the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams), but after losing Kelly he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris descends further into heavy drug and alcohol use, leading to a fistfight with Lance and a drug-addled one-night stand with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris. Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a lesbian affair with clothes designer Roxanne (Erica Gavin), who pressures her to have an abortion.

As they work on the car, they discover an old tire iron tucked beneath the driver's seat. Unbeknownst to them, this tire iron holds a secret that will turn their lives upside down. One evening, while they are working on the Camaro, Sophia accidentally drops the tire iron on the garage floor. Surprisingly, the impact causes a hidden compartment within the iron to reveal a cryptic hand-drawn map, with a set of coordinates leading to an unknown location. Intrigued by what they've found, Mel and Sophia decide to embark on a thrilling road trip to uncover the truth behind the map. As they journey along, they encounter various odd characters, each seemingly harboring secrets and showing an uncanny interest in their newfound discovery. Among these characters is an enigmatic woman named Gwen, who claims to be a journalist investigating a series of cold-case art heists that happened two decades ago. Gwen believes that the tire iron's mysterious map might point towards the location of one of the missing masterpieces, stolen by a highly skilled and elusive criminal known as \\"The Phantom.\\" After digging further into the case, Mel and Sophia learn that the Camaro once belonged to a prolific art dealer who went missing during the time of the heists. They begin to suspect that the tire iron and its hidden map were left behind as a clue for unraveling The Phantom's true identity. Together with Gwen, the trio must race against time as they work to piece together the puzzle before dangerous forces can reach the valuable stolen artwork. As their investigation leads them through mountainous terrains, hidden underground lairs, and a high-stakes auction filled with art enthusiasts, Mel slowly unravels the truth behind his family’s shocking connection to The Phantom. The tire iron proves not only to be the key to finding the stolen masterpieces but also to reconciling the seemingly unrelated events in Mel's life. As they close in on the true mastermind behind these heists, a climactic showdown at the coordinates' location ensues. The tire iron turns out to be the essential tool needed to unlock the secret chamber where the lost art is hidden. In the end, Mel realizes that the tire iron had far more than monetary significance; it served as the catalyst to mend his relationship with his daughter and build unwavering trust between them. \\"The Iron Turn\\" is a gripping tale of resilience, family bonds, and the pursuit of truth.

Extroverts are more likely to “Do, Think, Do” pattern, while their introverted counterparts take more time to think before taking an action. No way is better than the other, but knowing how you personally think will help you streamline your own thinking patterns. Self-awareness has been tied to leadership, and leadership often reflects a person's ability to think on one's feet. You can become more self-aware by practicing self-reflection techniques. Being more self-aware will help you better understand the environment around you, and make it easier to think of solutions or answer more quickly. How to Self Reflect Use a journal to write down your thoughts, feelings and reactions to mental stimuli throughout your day. Understand how you solve problems by considering each step you take Think about what emotions you feel during day to day tasks (I.e. Do you feel frustration while performing a specific task at work?) Think about why you might be feeling that emotion. To more effectively think on your feet, you need to gather as much information as possible about the situation you are in. One simple way of doing this is by asking questions about the task at hand. This will help you compile more information and help to educate you on a particular situation. Ask things like: “I hear that you want a report written about this client. What are you concerned about, specifically?” ”You seem to be asking me about a project we finished last week. What was it that you wanted to know about it?” ”What do you mean by what you said?” (This can help you get not only a clearer understanding of what was said, but also give the speaker to think about what s/he wants from you). By being critical of presented information, you are more likely to pick up on weak points of a situation. This may help you to see solutions quicker. Don't take everything at face value. If you are asked to do a specific task or answer a specific question, try to gather as much facts about the situation before you make a decision. While the goal is to think quickly and on your feet, you still want to be accurate and understanding. If you are asked to think on your feet by giving an answer to something that seems to be too good to be true (for example, a sale) be skeptical! It may very well be too good to be true!

The spoon was too hot to touch after sitting in the soup, as the","completion":"metal material of the spoon had absorbed the high heat from the freshly cooked soup, leading to thermal conduction. The principle of thermal conduction operates on the basis that molecules within an object such as the metal spoon will gain kinetic energy when subjected to a source of heat. Looking more closely at the science behind this, thermal conduction is about how heat moves from a higher temperature area to a lower one, seeking equilibrium. The soup, being the object with the higher temperature in this scenario, transferred its heat energy to the spoon, which had a lower temperature. This transfer happened at a molecular level. The hot soup caused the molecules of the spoon to vibrate and move faster, subsequently causing an increase in the spoon's temperature. Metals, as a category of materials, are particularly known for having a high thermal conductivity. They possess a tightly packed molecular structure with free-moving electrons that can readily absorb and distribute energy. Because of these properties, the metal spoon in the hot soup effectively acts like a heat sink, rapidly drawing the heat energy into itself. The longer the spoon remains in the scorching soup, the hotter it becomes until its temperature is nearly the same as the soup. It's crucial to keep in mind, though, that the handle of the spoon will generally heat up at a slower pace, since it's disconnected from the immediate heat source. Heat must travel from the bowl of the spoon, up the stem, to reach it. But, if given enough time, the handle can also become too hot to touch. To conclude, the \\"spoon was too hot to touch\\" after sitting in the soup as it was exposed to the high temperature soup for a certain period. This exposure initiated the process of thermal conduction, with heat being transferred from the soup to the cold spoon, making it extremely hot to the touch, signifying the efficiency of metal as a thermal conductor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A crew member who miraculously evaded death in the crash reveals that he survived the devastating plunge by adopting a foetal position. Ernesto Guevara, the heroic crew member, was one of the few to survive the catastrophic accident that claimed many lives. His heartrending account of the flight's last moments provides a poignant testament to the raw fear and dire circumstances that the passengers faced that ill-fated day. The flight took off on a cloudless morning, with no indication of the disaster to follow. The weather, Guevara recounts, was clear; a perfect day for a flight. However, a short while into their journey, the tranquillity on the plane began to morph into a chilling scene of terror. The aircraft began experiencing severe turbulence as storm clouds swelled around them. Amid the growing panic, cries of fear, and clattering utensils, something far more sinister became clear - the plane’s rapid descent. Guevara describes the screams of terror filling the cabin as the passengers realized their fate. \\"The plane pratically started free-falling\\", he recalls, \\"and that’s when everyone on board started screaming. It was not just people fearing for their lives, it was their screams of pure terror as we descended, knowing what was to come.\\" Despite being caught in this hellscape, Guevara's survival instinct kicked into gear. Remembering an old safety procedure - the Brace Position - which has its roots in protecting war pilot trainees and is designed to protect vital body areas in a crash, he instinctively curled into a foetal position. “I took off my seat belt, pushed my seat back as far as possible, and curled up on the floor, drawing my knees up to my chest,\\" he details. The sight, sounds, and smell of the crash are still frighteningly fresh in his mind. Upon impact, debris scattered. Fire engulfed the broken plane; the cacophony of the crash was overpowered by the intense smell of burning jet fuel and the horrifying sounds of the dying aircraft. Coming out of the crash, Guevara found himself broken but miraculously alive amidst the chaos and destruction. His decision to adopt the foetal position turned out to be a life-saving move. Researchers have long debated the protective qualities of this controversial position in accidents. Still, in Guevara's case, this position surely reduced the gravitational impact, protected his vital organs, and inevitably played a significant role in his survival. Guevara's tale of survival weaves together fear, courage, instinct and a remarkable will to live against all odds. It's a stark reminder of our innate human capacity to survive even when death looms just one breath away. In the midst of despair, the human spirit's tenacity shines through, reminding us that the will to live can make all the difference, even amidst screams of terror and falling aircraft."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth. - Framwellgate Bridge is a mediaeval masonry arch bridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building . - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages.

A 35-year-old Australian woman wound up in the hospital after wearing skinny jeans while helping a family member move. The move involved \\"many hours of squatting while emptying cupboards,\\" according to a report published Monday in the journal Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry. As the day went on, those jeans were making her increasingly uncomfortable. But it wasn't until that evening that the situation went south. As she walked home, the woman found herself struggling to lift her increasingly numb feet. She fell to the ground, and lay there for several hours before she was found and taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. At the hospital, the woman's legs were so swollen that staff had to cut off her jeans. Neurologists tried to figure out what had gone wrong. Tests revealed that she had almost no muscle strength in her ankles and toes, while the muscles of her hips and knees were normal. A CT scan of her legs showed signs of muscle damage in the calves. Tests of the tibial nerves, which provide movement and sensation to the calf and foot, and the peroneal nerves, which run from the outside of the knee down to the foot and ankle, showed they weren't sending signals properly. That was the clue. Nerve damage can be caused by pressure. In the case of the peroneal nerves, that can include pressure from crossing the legs, wearing high boots or squatting. (Previous research refers to \\"strawberry pickers' palsy.\\") \\"The wearing of 'skinny' jeans had likely potentiated the tibial neuropathies by causing a compartment syndrome as the lower leg swelled,\\" the report concluded. Not good. The swelling of compartment syndrome can lead to permanent muscle and nerve damage, or amputation. In this case, the victim fared better. After four days in the hospital on intravenous fluids, she regained her ability to walk and went home. No word on whether she's ever donned skinny jeans again. This isn't the first time we've reported on the perils of excessively tight trousers. In 2011, a doctor in Tarrytown, N.Y., told us about a 15-year-old soccer player who had numbness and tingling in her leg caused by wearing compression shorts. In some cases, the only damage tight clothes will do is to your wallet. Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission ordered to two companies to stop selling caffeine-infused shapewear, saying that the amped-up skivvies would not, as one firm claimed, \\"reduce the size of your hips by up to 2.1 inches and your thighs by up to one inch, and would eliminate or reduce cellulite and that scientific tests proved those results.\\" The FTC disputed that claim, and ordered the companies to fork over 1.5 million to customers who had been lured in by the promise of effortless shrinkage. ||||| Squatting in 'skinny' jeans for a protracted period of time can damage muscle and nerve fibres in the legs, making it difficult to walk, reveals a case study published online in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery & Psychiatry. Doctors describe a case of a 35 year old woman who arrived at hospital with severe weakness in both her ankles. The previous day she had been helping a relative move house, and had spent many hours squatting while emptying cupboards. She had been wearing tight 'skinny' jeans and recalled that these had felt increasingly tight and uncomfortable as the day wore on. Later that evening, she experienced numbness in her feet and found it difficult to walk, which caused her to trip and fall. Unable to get up, she spent several hours lying on the ground before she was found. Her calves were so swollen that her jeans had to be cut off her. She couldn't move her ankles or toes properly and had lost feeling in her lower legs and feet. Investigations revealed that she had damaged muscle and nerve fibres in her lower legs as a result of prolonged compression while squatting, which her tight jeans had made worse, the doctors suggest. The jeans had prompted the development of compartment syndrome--reduced blood supply to the leg muscles, causing swelling of the muscles and compression of the adjacent nerves. She was put on an intravenous drip and after 4 days she could walk unaided again, and was discharged from hospital. # ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This news article talks about a 35-year-old woman who had to go to the hospital because of severe weakness in her ankles after wearing 'skinny jeans' for a long time while squatting and helping her family move house.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who could not render the changes in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest?, what is it ?

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Stand a comfortable distance away. Position yourself vertically with the shot.\\"","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Cue Stick Grip: Techniques for Improved Billiards Performance Introduction Billiards, also known as cue sports, is a popular pastime enjoyed by millions of people worldwide, both competitively and for leisure. Central to success in billiards is the proper handling and grip of the cue stick, a critical but often overlooked skill. In this article, we will delve into the essentials of gripping the cue stick correctly, forming the perfect bridge with your off-hand, and aligning your body for optimal positional play. By effectively incorporating these techniques, you'll see an improvement in your shot accuracy and overall consistency. 1. Gripping the Cue Stick Correctly A proper grip on the cue stick is essential for stability, control, and precise cue-ball contact. To accomplish this, follow these steps: - Place your dominant hand's thumb and first two fingers around the cue stick's lower part. Your thumb and index finger should be about 4 to 6 inches away from the cue's bottom. This grip should be firm enough for control but not too tight to hamper your stroke. - Allow the cue stick to rest on the fleshy part of your palm near the base of your thumb for additional support. - Keep your wrist and arm relaxed to ensure a smooth and natural stroke. 2. Forming the Bridge with Your Off-Hand An effective bridge stabilizes the front part of the cue stick, providing control and guiding the tip during the shot. There are two main types of bridges: the open bridge and the closed bridge. - Open Bridge: In an open bridge, form a V-shaped groove between your thumb and forefinger by pressing them together and extending the remaining fingers on the table, providing additional support. The cue stick rests in this V-groove, allowing for easy movement and precise aiming. The open bridge is recommended for beginners or when attempting power shots. - Closed Bridge: The closed bridge requires wrapping your index finger around the cue stick, creating a more secure loop. Place your thumb on the table and extend your middle and ring fingers to provide support. Use the closed bridge for greater control and finesse in slower, more accurate shots. However, it is essential to practice and master the technique, as a too-tight grip can hinder accuracy. 3. Aligning Your Body with the Shot Body alignment plays a significant role in maintaining balance, directing focus, and executing an effective shot. Follow these guidelines to ensure proper alignment: - Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. This stance will provide adequate support and balance while shooting. - Position yourself vertically in line with the shot. Your dominant eye should be directly above the cue stick to ensure a clear line of sight. - Align your shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist with the cue stick to create a straight shooting line. - Bend your front knee slightly for additional stability, but avoid over-flexing, which can compromise balance and accuracy. 4. Positioning Yourself Comfortably One of the keys to successful shot execution is maintaining a comfortable distance from the ball while preparing to take your shot. With practice, you'll learn this optimal distance, but the following tips can help: - Stand far enough away from the table that your cue stick extends over the cue ball, allowing for a full, smooth backswing. - Adjust your position based on your height, arm length, and personal preferences. This distance may vary between players. - Practice your pre-shot routine to ensure consistent positioning before each shot, which will contribute to better shot accuracy and overall performance. Conclusion Improving your cue stick grip, bridge formation, body alignment, and positioning can significantly enhance your billiards skills. By mastering these fundamentals, you will experience greater consistency, accuracy, and control, ultimately leading to improved performance on the table. Incorporate these techniques into your practice sessions, and reap the rewards as you begin to outperform your competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's said that the material came originally from Nimes, a city in France. These jeans were particularly created for the sailors, who loved wearing jeans very much. These jeans could be worn when wet and it could even be rolled over with ease. This was particularly useful when the sailors were busy with their everyday work. Our favorite pair of blue, jeans was originally worn by workers particularly during World War II. Perhaps the strong and durable look made these blue jeans popular among all the factory workers. A strange thing that can be noticed happened in the early period of the 1950s when blue jeans worn by teens were considered to be a form of being against others. Besides, adults who wore blue jeans were not allowed to enter a movie theatre. It was only during the 1960s that blue jeans were accepted as a fashion trend in the United States of America. Movie stars wore them in films and in public. Many young people follow them. The different looks of the regular blue jeans which are enjoyed by people were introduced by the mid 1950s. It was Donald Freeland who gave jeans a whole new look and brought it to the front. Originally, jeans were always worn loose. At first, jeans worn by men had the zipper on the front. However, for women, it was on the side. By the late 1960's , the zipper finally was on the front side for women as well. Today, there are many new designs that are being created by fashion designers to meet the increasing demands from jean lovers!

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation. Have you read 'Wise Blood?' It's an amazing book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself, a devout catholic, and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith, doubt, and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south, but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist, they are human beings with families, feelings, and concerns like anyone else. Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent, distressing, and maddening of circumstances. To read 'Wise Blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally, it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view. None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor, the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap, amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly, truly terrible. As an aside, I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views, and while I was raised in the deep south, years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth), and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you're into being offended (which I am not), then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line. I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know, and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker, to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work. So I don't claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and, I might add, for self-respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses strong disappointment and disapproval of the film adaptation of 'Wise Blood,' criticizing various aspects such as acting, accents, insight, and soundtrack. They feel that the movie fails to capture the essence of Flannery O'Connor's novel, and see it as an offensive caricature of the southern characters and setting. Though the reviewer acknowledges John Huston's respected place in film history, they ultimately consider the movie a waste of time for fans of the book and self-respecting southerners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what lays their eggs in a burrow?\\" is \\"all mammals\\", given that some mammals lay their eggs in a burrow? The answer is:","completion":"No, the statement \\"all mammals\\" being the answer to the question \\"what lays their eggs in a burrow?\\" would not be accurate. Firstly, to consider this, we need to clarify that the majority of mammals do not actually lay eggs at all. Mammals are primarily characterized by their method of reproduction. There are approximately 5,000 species of mammals and, among them, the majority give birth to live young. This process is the result of internal fertilization and the development of the embryo inside the body of the female. Thus, the offspring, in most common cases, develop and are born fully formed. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. There are only five known species of mammals that lay eggs, and they are practically identified as the monotremes: the platypus and four species of echidna (or spiny anteaters). Notably, these monotremes do lay their eggs in burrows or nests because they cannot physically carry them like birds do due to the lack of a shell sturdy enough to withstand the weight without cracking. For example, the female platypus will use her tail to bring leaves and other debris into her burrow and create a nest, where she'll lay one or two eggs and keep them warm by curling her body around them. Also, some types of armadillo are known to burrow and may lay their young in these protected spaces. So yes, while it is true that \\"some mammals\\" do lay their eggs in burrows, it would be misleading and incorrect to say \\"all mammals\\" do this. The vast majority of mammals are placental or marsupials that give live birth, not egg layers, and while some mammals do burrow for various reasons such as protection, rest or to give birth, not all of these burrowing mammals lay eggs. Therefore, it's crucial to understand that saying all mammals lay their eggs in burrows would definitely be a misconception. Instead, the term \\"all mammals\\" should be replaced with \\"all monotremes\\" to maintain the accuracy of the statement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He wrote: 'Skunkworks's get-out clause for the sale is that the herb is not for human consumption, but their advice is to help you relax by burning the herbs in the home. 'I find these twisted semantics as repugnant as I am sure you do. Skunkworks, its fellow shops and its websites must be banned.' Fellow Tory Tracey Crouch, the MP for Chatham, Kent where Jimmy died, echoed his sentiments. She said: 'People need to understand the dangers of legal highs. Just because they are legal doesn't mean they're not harmful. 'The government needs to urgently review legislation around the sale and purchase of these substances.' UK Skunkworks, which has 21 green-fronted shops across the south of England, has defended their sales. A spokesman said there was no evidence that Karen's son who lived in Gravesend, Kent, bought one of their products, despite her claims. He said: 'Our sympathy is with Mr Guichard's family. 'We get all our products from an official supplier and they do not have any UK Skunkworks branding on them, neither do our bags. 'All our products are clearly labelled 'not for human consumption'. Our customers are closely monitored and we check IDs. 'If we feel that someone is going to ignore the warning we will not sell the product to them.' Shock: His mother today described how she held her 'fit and healthy' son in her arms after the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support machine. The company bills itself as 'the UK's premier one-stop shop for lifestyle accessories, smoking paraphernalia and adult fun!' It also boasts 'all of our products are completely legal in the UK as they do not fall under the Misuse of Drugs Act'. In a letter of reply to MP Brazier the company said: 'Calling for UK Skunkworks to be shut down is a pitiful attempt at dealing with the issues we face. 'We sell a wide range of popular products that are received very well by an adult market.' The legal highs sold by UK Skunkworks include the best-selling party drug benzo extreme, which some experts say can become addictive. Others are E-Scape, compared to ecstacy, and Pure Gold, amyl nitrate used to give a split-second head rush. For legal reasons Skunkworks insist their products are not for human consumption and sell them instead as 'plant food' or 'room odorisers'. The store claims that physical shops are the most 'responsible' way to sell them. The spokesman added: 'Online it's much harder to regulate. You can go online with dad's credit card, tick a box to say you're 18 and have anonymous delivery.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A mother shared a sad photo of her dying son to warn people about the dangers of legal highs. Her son, Jimmy, was a healthy 20-year-old who had a heart attack and suffered brain damage after taking a herbal substance. His mom wants to change the law about legal high shops like the one where Jimmy bought the substance. She thinks these shops should be banned so no one else has to feel the pain she feels. Even though these substances are legal, they can still be harmful, and people need to be careful with them."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \\"People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,\\" he said. \\"But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford.\\" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. \\"His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,\\" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. \\"You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,\\" Paul said. He believes that after Shakespeare bought it, all his thinking time was spent there, and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there.

Migrants from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka were reportedly heading to New Zealand last month when an Australian navy ship intercepted them and an immigration official paid each member of the crew A5,000 (3,900; Â£2,500) to turn back to Indonesia. When the story came to light a few days ago, Mr Abbott side-stepped questions about its veracity, saying instead Australia had developed \\"incredibly creative\\" strategies to deal with asylum seekers arriving by boat. Asked if he would pay people smugglers - people the government had described as criminals - Mr Abbott replied: \\"What we do is we stop the boats by hook or by crook because that's what we've got to do and that's what we've successfully done and I just don't want to go into the details... The important thing is to stop the boats.\\" It was one of the oldest rhetorical tricks of all time, says Dr Dennis Glover, a professional speechwriter and a fellow of think-tank Per Capita. \\"They are taking something that is a mistake and re-describing it as a success,\\" says Dr Glover, who has previously worked for several Labor Party leaders. If the allegations are true, paying money to people smugglers could have been a huge political blunder. \\"It is implicit in their descriptions of evil people smugglers that you would not give them money... But by paying them it is the asylum seekers who become the real enemy while people smugglers can help us out by turning their boats back,\\" he explains. \\"It is the ultimate PR triumph.\\" Others think Mr Abbott is testing the public's appetite for tougher action on asylum seekers. The government will be wondering whether people are willing to let them stop the boats at any cost, says political scientist in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, Dr Zareh Ghazarian. By using phrases such as \\"by hook or by crook\\", Mr Abbott is reminding people how far he is willing to go to deliver on his election promise to stop the boats, says Dr Ghazarian, without committing himself on the payment issue. \\"Asylum seekers and stopping the boats is arguably the government's one political achievement,\\" he says. \\"If they can't manage the asylum seeker issue and the boats start arriving again in the numbers we have seen in past years they will have lost credibility on this issue.\\" Social commentator and writer Jane Caro agrees. \\"Stopping the boats is the only real success story for the government to hang its hat on,\\" says Ms Caro, noting that it is a policy that remains popular with most Australians. \\"I am speculating but Mr Abbott will be thinking that eventually [stopping the boats] will get tougher and he is not willing to remove anything from his bag of tricks,\\" she says. \\"Here is a prime minister who is reserving his options.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the situation of migrants from Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka heading to New Zealand.

What is the answer for the question: What did Representative Joseph M. McDade want to make a National Historic Site? from the following article ? When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year.

From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Mounded prairie"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Emecheta's books were on the national curricula of several African countries. She was known for championing women and girls in her writing, though famously rejected description as a feminist. \\"I work toward the liberation of women but I'm not feminist. I'm just a woman,\\" she said. The topics she covered in her writing included child marriage, life as a single mother, abuse of women and racism in the UK and elsewhere. \\"Black women all over the world should re-unite and re-examine the way history has portrayed us,\\" she said. The president of the Association of Nigerian Authors, Denja Abdullahi, said: \\"We have lost a rare gem in this field. Her works would forever live to speak for her. \\"It is a sad loss to our circle. She was known for championing the female gender and we would forever miss her.\\" Lagos-born Emecheta had moved to the UK in 1960, working as a librarian and becoming a student at London University, where she read sociology. She later worked as a community worker in London for several years. She left her husband when he refused to read her first novel and burnt the manuscript, a World Service series on women writers reported. The book, In the Ditch, was eventually published in 1972. That and Second-Class Citizen, which followed in 1974, were fictionalised portraits of a young Nigerian woman struggling to bring up children in London. Later, she wrote about civil conflict in Nigeria and the experience of motherhood in a changing Ibo society. An assessment of her writing, published by the British Council, says: \\"The female protagonists of Emecheta's fiction challenge the masculinist assumption that they should be defined as domestic properties whose value resides in their ability to bear children and in their willingness to remain confined at home. \\"Initiative and determination become the distinguishing marks of Emecheta's women. They are resourceful and turn adverse conditions into their triumph.\\"","completion":"Emecheta was a famous author from Africa. She wrote books that many people in African countries studied at school. She liked to write about women and girls being strong, but she didn't like to call herself a feminist. She wanted all black women to work together and understand the past better. People who knew her said she was very important and would be missed. Emecheta was born in a place called Lagos and moved to the UK. She worked, studied, and wrote books there. Her first novel was burned, but it finally got published and became popular along with her other books. Her characters showed that women were strong and could do great things."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Unfortunately, the film I recently saw fell drastically short of my expectations. \\"Disappointment in the Darkness\\" earned its title not only in name but also in how it left the audience feeling. Permit me to explain why this film did not live up to the hype and why I must give it a negative review. (Step 2: Discuss the lack of character development) The characters in the film come across as shallow and one-dimensional, revealing a weak and uninspired script. Despite having talented actors at its disposal, the movie fails to give them any emotional depth or development. The protagonists are forgettable, and their relationships with one another appear contrived. This makes it impossible for the audience to connect with the characters or truly care about their fate. (Step 3: Criticize the lackluster storyline) Furthermore, the storyline offers nothing new or innovative. Falling victim to cliché after cliché, the plot becomes predictable and tedious. Any attempts to subvert expectations are poorly executed and feel forced. The film drags on, and viewers are left wondering when, or even if, the plot will pick up its pace. (Step 4: Judge the cinematography and visual effects) Sadly, the cinematography and visual effects do not redeem this movie either. The film's visuals feel lackluster and bland throughout its runtime, with low-effort CGI and uninspired camera work adding to the disappointment. Such a low-quality presentation only serves to distract from what could have been an engaging experience. (Step 5: Discuss the impact of the film's music) As for the music, it does little to enhance the movie's atmosphere. Instead, the generic score seems to clash with the on-screen action, pulling viewers out of their immersion repeatedly. This thwarted any opportunity for the audience to lose themselves in the story, a crucial aspect for any successful film. (Step 6: Conclude the review) In conclusion, \\"Disappointment in the Darkness\\" is a disappointing and forgettable film that leaves audiences underwhelmed. The characters lack development, the storyline is clichéd and predictable, and the visuals and music fail to captivate. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to fellow movie enthusiasts.

Article: Iranian security forces have arrested an Iranian-American businessman who had promoted improved ties between the two countries, adding to signs that hard-liners in Tehran are trying to block foreign investors from entering the Islamic Republic in the wake of the historic nuclear deal. In the past few weeks, Iranian businessmen with links to foreign companies have been detained, interrogated and warned against wading into economic... ||||| Iran has arrested another American holding dual citizenship, bringing to four the number of Iranian Americans imprisoned in Tehran after they came under suspicion by hard-line security forces. Siamak Namazi, a businessman based in Dubai who is in his early 40s, was arrested earlier this month when he was visiting a friend in Tehran, according to a family friend who did not want to be identified. It was not clear whether any charges have been brought against him or what authorities might allege he did. Namazi, the son of a former governor in the oil-rich Iranian province of Khuzestan, comes from a prominent Iranian family. Namazi’s family came to the United States in 1983 when he was a boy, and he later returned to Iran after graduating from college to serve in the Iranian military. He has consulted on business opportunities in Iran for more than a decade. A relative of Namazi’s said the family had tried to keep the arrest private, and the relative declined to comment. Word of the arrest of an unnamed Iranian American businessman was first reported by Iran Wire on Oct. 15. Namazi was named as the one who was arrested in several tweets by Iranian Americans earlier this month. The State Department has repeatedly pressed Iran to release three other imprisoned Americans: Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, who has been held for more than a year, was recently convicted after an espionage trial; former Marine Amir Hekmati of Flint, Mich., who was accused of being a spy when he went to Iran to visit his grandmother, has been held since 2011; and Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Boise, Idaho, was convicted in 2013 of threatening Iran’s national security by participating in home churches. Rezaian, Hekmati and Abedini have all strongly denied the allegations against them. [Iranian media says Post correspondent Jason Rezaian convicted] When asked about Namazi, the State Department declined to confirm his arrest. “We’re aware of recent reports of the possible arrest in Iran of a person reported to have U.S. citizenship,” said State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner. “We’re looking into these reports and don’t have anything further to provide at this time.” Namazi’s arrest suggests that hard-liners in Iran may be trying to create another point of tension with the United States and thereby throw a wrench in the Iran nuclear deal. His arrest came days before an ­agreed-upon date called adoption day, when the Iranian government has committed to begin dismantling some of its nuclear infrastructure. The part of the government controlled by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is reformist-minded and seeks more engagement with the West to help jump-start its economy. But hard-liners who control the judiciary and intelligence services oppose the idea, fearful it will open the country to foreign influence. The Revolutionary Guard, Iraq’s most powerful security and military organization, is the entity that would have been responsible for the arrests of the four Iranian Americans. Iranian Americans such as Namazi are particularly vulnerable to arrest because Iran does not recognize dual nationality. An Iranian official in Vienna for talks on the Syrian war said the arrest of Namazi and other Iranian Americans should not deter other dual nationals from visiting the country “Iran is safe for Iranian Americans” said the official, who would only discuss the sensitive arrest on condition of anonymity. “Thousands visit Iran regularly. These situations rarely happen, and we hope they can all be resolved.” Namazi himself has written prolifically about his experiences and conflicted feelings toward the country of his birth. His writings paint the portrait of an idealist who tried to build ­bridges between the country of his birth and the country where he was raised. He moved to the United States when his father got a job with the United Nations. He earned degrees from the London Business School and from Rutgers and Tufts universities. Namazi was still young during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khom­eini returned to Tehran after 15 years in exile, and his supporters took over the government. In journal-like pieces he wrote more than a decade ago for the Iranian, he talked about his decision after graduating from Tufts to return to his birthplace. “Iran had practically become a dream now, an invented product of childhood imagination,” he wrote. “Still, this land of my dreams was all I thought about. My passion for return was so great, it hurt. The only thing greater than that pain was the fear that I rarely even allowed myself to think of: What happens if I someday return and find out that everything has changed? Then I will be left dry, without a dream, a hope, a home.” [Iran deal: What they said. What they got.] He became a U.S. citizen in 1993. One reason, he later wrote, was to make it easier to get grants and scholarships to pay for his education, and so he could travel without the hassles of an Iranian passport. A year later, in 1994, he returned to Iran to fulfill his compulsory military duty. He spent 2 1/ 2 years there, serving as a duty officer in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. He also wrote often that he thought Iranian Americans could be the bridge between the two cultures that often viewed each other as enemies. “The new generation must be made to feel that no matter how much time elapses they will be welcomed and treated with respect in the land of their parents,” he wrote in 1998. “Iran is our motherland, our home, our innocence, our retreat, our passion, our love. It is our unalienable right to travel to and from Iran freely and without restrictions. If you really want us back to help rebuild the country, if you want our children to maintain a bond to the land of their parents, stop treating us like criminals. Why do we have to explain ourselves to you?” Namazi worked for a time at a family consulting company founded in Tehran and later based in Dubai. According to its Web site, the Atieh Group helped Iranian businesses connect with foreign companies seeking to do business inside Iran. More recently, he worked as the head of strategic planning at the Crescent Petroleum Co. in the United Arab Emirates. It was unclear whether he was employed as a management consultant at the time of his arrest or whether he was working independently. In recent years, Namazi became outspoken about how financial sanctions had made it difficult to obtain lifesaving medicine in Iran, even though they are technically exempted. “The West must relax and rationalize the terms of its sanctions regime against Iran to allow more medical goods into the country,” he wrote in an opinion-page piece for the New York Times in 2013. “If it doesn’t, more Iranian men, women and children will suffer needlessly.” Read more: The mechanism behind the Iran nuclear deal goes into motion While Congress argues over Iran, Europe rushes to do business there The key moments in the long history of U.S.-Iran relations ||||| Mr. Namazi is at least the fourth American of Iranian descent to be incarcerated by the Iranian authorities and the first since the nuclear agreement was completed. The agreement is supposed to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for verifiable guarantees that its nuclear work is peaceful. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Word of Mr. Namazi’s arrest, which was reported by The Washington Post on Thursday, came as the political atmosphere in Iran is again taking a turn toward the strident anti-Americanism that prevailed before the talks that led to the nuclear accord, which Iran negotiated with six world powers, including the United States. Mr. Namazi had been in Tehran since September, when he was visiting from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where he lives. He had apparently intended the trip to be short. His passport was confiscated, said the people close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his arrest has not been officially announced. Mr. Namazi’s relatives declined to comment. Officials at Crescent Petroleum did not respond to attempts to reach them by telephone and email for comment. Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, issued a statement in response to queries about Mr. Namazi: “We’re aware of recent reports of the possible arrest in Iran of a person reported to have U.S. citizenship. We’re looking into these reports and don’t have anything further to provide at this time.” The arrest coincided with increasingly shrill accusations by some members of Iran’s Parliament that one of the other imprisoned Iranian-Americans, Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, heads a network of spies. Mr. Rezaian, arrested in July 2014, was convicted of espionage this month, but the details and his sentence have not been made public. The Iranian authorities have also imprisoned Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, and Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran. There had been hopes that all would be freed after the nuclear accord was reached. Experts on Iranian politics said the reported arrest of Mr. Namazi was a signal of a possible backlash by opponents of the nuclear agreement in Iran. They view the accord as a nefarious way for Americans to gain influence in Iranian society. “It’s not a good sign for those who want to open Iran to the West and the United States,” said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation in Washington. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made clear in speeches and letters that in his view the nuclear agreement should not lead to more cooperation with the United States. In September, he called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to “guard the Islamic Revolution,” and he warned that the United States was trying to “infiltrate” the country, politically and culturally. Mr. Namazi, a graduate of Tufts University, moved between the United States and Iran, settling down in Tehran in the mid-1990s. He and some relatives started a successful consulting firm, Atieh Bahar, that advised Western oil and multinational companies. After the 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose administration accused the company of having improper relations with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and rival to Mr. Ahmadinejad, Atieh Bahar’s top leadership was ousted. Harassed by security forces, Mr. Namazi left Iran in 2009. He returned for brief family visits after the 2013 election of Mr. Ahmadinejad’s successor, Hassan Rouhani, who had campaigned on a desire to have the Western economic sanctions on Iran eased. In September, The Daily Beast published a highly critical, anonymously written article about Mr. Namazi and his family. The Daily Beast article, which friends of Mr. Namazi have said they believe was part of a campaign to incriminate him, said that he played a leading role in the National Iranian American Council. The group said in a statement on its website on Thursday that neither Mr. Namazi nor his family “have had any leadership or any other significant role.” |||||Summary:","completion":"Iranian security forces have reportedly arrested Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman who promoted improved ties between the two countries, further indicating that hard liners in Iran are trying to prevent foreign investors from entering the country following the historic nuclear deal. As we previously highlighted, businessmen with links to foreign companies have been detained and interrogated over the past few weeks, suggesting that hard liners in Iran may be trying to create another point of tension with the US to delay progress of the nuclear deal. Namazi’s family came to the US in 1983, and he returned to Iran after graduating from college to serve in the Iranian military; his arrest brings the number of Iranian-Americans detained by Tehran to four. Iran does not recognise dual nationality, making Iranian-Americans particularly vulnerable to arrest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare.

Given the following context: Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number-three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.\\"Sat in Your Lap\\" was the first single from the album to be released.

Step 4: Mix ginger with softened butter In the small bowl, I would mix the freshly grated ginger with about two tablespoons of softened unsalted butter. This mixture will be spread onto the toast for added flavor. Step 5: Toast the bread I would place the bread slices into the toaster or oven, set to a medium or desired level of crispiness, and toast the bread until it reaches the preferred level of browning. Step 6: Assemble the grapefruit-ginger toast Once the bread is toasted, I would carefully spread the ginger-butter mixture evenly onto each slice of toast. Next, I would arrange the grapefruit slices or wedges on top of the toast to cover the surface.

The town hires lawman and peacekeeper Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his deputy Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to protect and regain control of the town. The pair agree on one condition: that the town follow Cole's law and essentially cede control to him. The lawmen begin by confronting four of Bragg's men who are causing a disturbance in the saloon. Three men refuse to allow themselves to be arrested, forcing Cole and Hitch to kill them. The fourth man surrenders and leaves the saloon. Bragg has a meeting with Cole and Hitch, initiating a standoff. Cole meets a new arrival to the town, the recently widowed Allie French (RenÃ©e Zellweger), who has traveled west to find a new life. The two start a romantic relationship, and soon buy a house together. However, Allie is revealed to be promiscuous and attempts to seduce Hitch when they are alone. Despite having shown previous interest in her, Hitch refuses her advances out of loyalty to Cole. When one of Bragg's men tells Cole and Hitch he will testify that he witnessed Bragg gun down the marshal, Bragg is tried, convicted and sentenced to hang. Following the trial, Cole and Hitch, along with several deputies, transport Bragg via train. As the train is stopped for refueling over a bridge, hired guns Ring and Mackie Shelton (Lance Henriksen and Adam Nelson), old acquaintances of Cole, appear with Allie at gunpoint, forcing Cole to release Bragg to them.

When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. But I can use this background: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. What is an answer for this question: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","completion":"Based on Jeff's taller stature and the background information provided, Jeff would likely play basketball better due to his size advantage.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true given the truth of the first sentence, we need to examine the information provided in both sentences and see if they can coexist without any contradictions. Sentence 1: Jon waited. This sentence gives us the information that Jon was involved in an action – waiting. It does not give us any information about the physical position Jon was in while waiting, such as sitting, standing, or leaning. Therefore, we have limited information based on this sentence. Sentence 2: Jon stood there, waiting. In this sentence, we are given more specific information about Jon's action and position. It states that Jon was not only waiting but also standing in a particular location. Going back to the question, if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? The answer is: the second sentence could be true if the additional information provided in it does not contradict the information in the first sentence. Based on the information given, the first sentence implies that Jon was waiting, but it does not say anything about his position. The second sentence adds more detail, telling us that Jon was standing while waiting. Since the first sentence does not contradict Jon's position of standing while waiting, the second sentence can be considered true as well. In conclusion, if the first sentence \\"Jon waited.\\" is true, the second sentence \\"Jon stood there, waiting.\\" could also be true because it adds more specific details about Jon's action and position, which does not conflict with the information provided in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you are traveling to another country or even a different region of your own country, careful preparation is an important part of your trip. This can help ensure that places you visit don't present any serious health hazards and may minimize your risk of contracting an illness before you leave.","completion":"In the next paragraph: Understand the potential health risks and take necessary precautions. After careful preparation, it is essential to be aware of the specific health hazards and risks associated with the tropics to ensure your well-being during your travels. The tropical environment presents numerous potential health concerns due to factors like warm temperatures, high humidity, and an abundance of vectors for infectious diseases (such as mosquitoes and ticks). By understanding these risks, you can take preventive measures to significantly reduce your chances of illness. 1. Research endemic diseases and recommended vaccinations: Consult a travel health specialist or visit your country's travel health advisory website to learn about the prevalent diseases in your destination, such as malaria, dengue fever, or yellow fever. These resources will also inform you about recommended vaccinations or prophylactic medications, which you should arrange to receive well before departure. 2. Pack a comprehensive travel health kit: Carry a well-stocked first aid kit, including essential medication for pain relief, allergies, diarrhea, and motion sickness. Include insect repellent, sunscreen, antiseptic wipes, and adhesive bandages to handle minor injuries and reduce the risk of infection. Additionally, pack water purification tablets or portable water filters, as safe drinking water may not be readily accessible in some destinations. 3. Practice good hygiene: Regular hand washing and sanitizing are critical in preventing the spread of diseases. Be cautious about the food and drink you consume – avoid uncooked meats, unpasteurized dairy products, and unpeeled fruits. Drink only bottled or treated water, and avoid ice in your beverages if you suspect the water source might be contaminated. 4. Protect yourself against insect-borne diseases: Use insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin, and wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, particularly during the peak mosquito activity hours (dawn and dusk). Sleep under a mosquito net or in a screened or air-conditioned room to minimize exposure to harmful insects. 5. Be cautious with outdoor activities: Exposure to heat, humidity, and intense sunlight may lead to dehydration, heatstroke, or sunburn. Avoid outdoor activities during the hottest part of the day, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Apply sunscreen with a high SPF frequently and wear a hat for added protection. 6. Get travel insurance: Comprehensive travel insurance can provide essential financial protection and support, especially if you require medical treatment or evacuation during your trip. Verify that your policy covers the specific activities you plan to engage in and pre-existing medical conditions to ensure adequate coverage. By acquainting yourself with the potential health risks and taking the necessary precautions, you greatly enhance your ability to enjoy a safe and healthy tropical adventure. Moreover, you minimize the chances of bringing home unwanted illnesses, making for a pleasant return to your daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand. Representative Scott Taylor of Virginia told the New York Times that he believes the president's \\"divisive...

The Democratic victories in the 2017 governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey were seen as a direct rebuke of Trump's policies and leadership. Exit polls in both states indicated that anger towards Trump played a significant role in motivating Democratic voters to head to the polls. Additionally, the focus on Trump and his policies, such as immigration, was a central theme during the campaign in Virginia, where Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In their victory speeches, both Governor-elect Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Northam of Virginia emphasized that their wins sent a message rejecting the divisiveness, hatred, and bigotry they associated with Trump's policies and rhetoric."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their study, in Science Translation Medicine, showed caffeine was more than just a stimulant and actually slowed down the body's internal clock. A double espresso three hours before bedtime delayed the production of the sleep hormone melatonin by about 40 minutes, making it harder to nod off. Experts said our own actions had a huge influence on sleep and the body clock. One of the researchers, Dr John O'Neill, from the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, told the BBC News website: \\"If you're tired and having a coffee at night to stay awake, then that is a bad idea, you'll find it harder to go to sleep and get enough sleep.\\" In his half of the study, cells grown in a dish were exposed to caffeine to work out how it changed their ability to keep time. It showed the drug was able to alter the chemical clocks ticking away in every cell of the human body. Meanwhile, five people at the University of Colorado Boulder, in the US, were locked in a sleep laboratory for 50 days. And as light exposure is the main way we normally control our body clock, they spent most of their incarceration in very dim light. In a series of experiments over the month and a half, the scientists showed that an evening dose of caffeine slowed the body clock by 40 minutes. It had roughly half the impact of three hours of bright light at bedtime. Dr O'Neill said it would be \\"complete speculation\\" to set a cut-off time for drinking caffeine in the evening but he personally never drank coffee after 17:00. He said the findings may help treat some sleep disorders and people who naturally woke up too early - known as larks - to help keep them in sync with the rest of the world. \\"It could be useful with jet lag if you are flying east to west where taking caffeine at the right time of day might speed up the time it takes to overcome jet lag,\\" he added. Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, from the University of Surrey, told the BBC: \\"Individuals differ in their sensitivity to caffeine, and if coffee drinkers experience problems with falling asleep, they may try to avoid drinking coffee in the afternoon and evening.\\" He added that people \\"too often\\" thought they were a \\"slave\\" to their body clocks and programmed to wake up early or late. \\"These and other data clearly indicate that we can to some extent modify these rhythms and that part of the reason why we sleep so late relates to factors such as caffeine intake and the exposure to artificial light in the evening,\\" he said.

Article:","completion":"Title: From Dilapidated Victorian House to High-Tech Office: Roisin Isaacs's Remarkable Journey Introduction: Roisin Isaacs, a successful entrepreneur, has undergone a remarkable transformation in her personal and professional life. From living off benefits and food banks in Dundee for the reality show Secret Millionaire, she has now spent a staggering £1.45 million on a home renovation project in Buckinghamshire. This article delves into the fascinating story behind the renovation, her charitable giving, and Isaacs's approach to solving social problems. Step 1: Discuss the property and renovation journey Roisin Isaacs's Buckinghamshire home was once a dilapidated Victorian property in need of major repairs. Isaacs saw potential in the house and decided to take on the challenge of restoring it to its former glory, despite the hefty price tag of £700,000. The renovation process was long and arduous, with an additional bill of £750,000 to complete the transformation. Step 2: Highlight the unique features of the renovated house One of the most striking features of the renovated Victorian house is the inclusion of stencilled quotes that adorn the walls, reflecting Roisin's personal values and unique design choices. The once-neglected animal area has also undergone a remarkable transformation and now serves as a high-tech office space, showcasing Isaacs's ability to repurpose and reimagine spaces. Step 3: Mention her experience on Secret Millionaire Before embarking on this extraordinary renovation journey, Roisin Isaacs lived in Dundee, relying on benefits and food banks as a participant in the reality show Secret Millionaire. This experience gave her valuable insights into the challenges faced by individuals who depend on social support systems. Step 4: Address her views on charity and social problems Although Isaacs has given generously to charity—£40,000 to be exact—she firmly believes that handouts alone will not solve the underlying issues faced by the less privileged. Her experience on Secret Millionaire allowed her to see firsthand the complexities of social problems, and she has since dedicated herself to finding alternative ways to address these challenges. Conclusion: Roisin Isaacs's journey from living off benefits and foodbanks in Dundee to investing in her Buckinghamshire dream home is a testament of her resilience and entrepreneurial spirit. The transformed Victorian property now reflects her distinct style and values, while her commitment to fighting social injustice remains unshaken. This inspiring story demonstrates that financial success and a compassionate heart can go hand in hand, reinforcing the notion that it is not simply charity that changes lives, but a deeper understanding of the root causes of social problems and the tenacity to address them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Calculate h h = (-3)/(-5) - 28/(-20) First, simplify fractions: h = (3/5) + (7/5) Now, add the fractions (make sure they have the same denominator): h = (3/5) + (7/5) = (3+7)/5 = 10/5 Simplify the fraction: h = 10/5 = 2 Step 2: Calculate 0/(-4) - (h + -17) Since any number divided by itself is 0 (except division by 0), we have: 0/(-4) = 0 So, the expression becomes: 0 - (h + -17) = 0 - (2 + -17) Step 3: Simplify the expression 0 - (2 + -17) = 0 - (-15) = 15 Step 4: Find the remainder when 15 is divided by 6 To find the remainder, simply divide 15 by 6 and consider the remainder: 15 ÷ 6 = 2 with a remainder of 3 The remainder when 0/(-4) - (h + -17) is divided by 6 is 3.

Crude oil prices–and the shares of U.S. oil and gas companies–surged over 8% Wednesday as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut its output by some 1.2 million barrels a day to end a global glut. If fully implemented, the deal will effectively end the price war started by Saudi Arabia two years ago in its efforts to wrest market share back from U.S., a ploy that has wrecked the budgets of many OPEC members including Saudi itself. Crucially, the deal is dependent on persuading major non-OPEC producers such as Russia to cut output too, by a total of 600,000 barrels a day. Moscow, having previously said it would only freeze production at current (record high) levels, has now committed to cut by 300,000 barrels a day, OPEC President and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh al-Sada told a press conference in Vienna after the meeting. Al-Sada said that Saudi Arabia would take the biggest hit, cutting by 486,000 barrels a day to just over 10 million. Reuters reported that Iran, Saudi’s biggest rival in the cartel, had agreed to freeze its output close to current levels, which would represent a major diplomatic coup for the Islamic Republic in the face of heavy Saudi pressure to share the pain. “We believe it is very much achievable,” al-Sada said. But the actual cut isn’t as big as OPEC would like to present it. The cartel has simply stopped counting the 750,000 barrels a day produced by Indonesia, on the grounds that it is no longer an oil exporter. And there is no way of knowing how Russia will measure its contribution yet. In the past it has merely chosen to defer planned output increases. The exact production quotas are still to be published. Shares in the biggest U.S. shale producers exploded on the deal, as the threat of a longer price war receded. EOG Resources (eog), Apache Corp (spa), and Chesapeake Energy (chi) all rose by over 8% on the news. Conventional heavyweights ExxonMobil (xom), Chevron (cvx), and Conocophillips (cop) also gained strongly, lifting the S&P 500 to a new record high. At midday, the benchmark futures contract for U.S. crude was up 8.5% to 49.08, which was a five-week high. “I don’t think this means that we’re going back to a world of 100 oil or even 75 oil, but it does mean that we’re not going back to a world of 28 any time soon,” Andy Brogan, global oil and gas transaction leader at EY, told Fortune. As a result, shale companies can be more confident about drilling, and banks can be more confident about lending to them, Brogan said. The key variable, he noted, will be how quickly, and how cost-effectively, the industry can do that–given that the carnage in the oil services sector since 2014 has “hollowed out” the supply chain. If the cut sticks, then the International Energy Agency reckons that the world market could “move from surplus to deficit very quickly in 2017,” leading prices to rise sharply once the existing stock overhang is depleted. The question is, though, will it stick? Or will a reviving shale industry simply enjoy a free ride on OPEC’s discipline? “If you get to the next OPEC meeting and all that has happened is that shale has replaced the entire cut, then there is a risk that they’ll think again,” EY’s Brogan said. ||||| VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC has agreed its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted “a big hit” on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output, pushing up crude prices by around 10 percent. Fast-growing producer Iraq also agreed to curtail its booming output, while non-OPEC Russia will join output cuts for the first time in 15 years to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prop up oil prices. “OPEC has proved to the skeptics that it is not dead. The move will speed up market rebalancing and erosion of the global oil glut,” said OPEC watcher Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects. The cut did not come without a casualty, however. Indonesia, the producer group’s only East Asian member, said it would suspend its membership after rejoining only this year as it was not willing to comply with the output cuts sought. Following news of the deal, the price for Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, surged to settle up nearly 9 percent. They eased slightly in early Asian trading on concerns that other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, could fill any gap. The agreement came despite huge political hurdles. Iran and Russia are effectively fighting two proxy wars against Saudi Arabia, in Yemen and Syria, and many skeptics had said the countries would struggle to find a compromise. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said ahead of the meeting that the kingdom was prepared to accept “a big hit” on production to get a deal done. “I think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry and ... it should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth,” he told reporters after the decision. SOME CAUTION ON CUTS Some observers were more cautious. “This is an agreement to cap production levels, not export levels,” British bank Barclays said in a note. “The outcome is consistent with ... what OPEC production levels were expected to be in 2017, irrespective of the deal reached.” Despite Wednesday’s price surge, oil prices are still only at levels last seen in September and October, when plans for a cut were first announced, and are at less than half their levels of mid-2014, when the glut started. OPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrels per day, and under the Wednesday deal it would reduce output by around 1.2 million bpd from January 2017. That would take its output to January 2016 levels, when prices fell to over 10 year lows. Saudi Arabia will take the lion’s share of cuts by reducing output by almost 0.5 million bpd to 10.06 million bpd. Its Gulf OPEC allies - the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar - would cut by a total 0.3 million bpd. Iraq, which had insisted on higher output quotas to fund its fight against Islamic State militants, unexpectedly agreed to reduce production - by 0.2 million bpd. Iran was allowed to boost production slightly from its October level - a victory for Tehran, which has long argued it needs to regain market share lost under Western sanctions.

REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader WILL OPEC COMPLY? Falih had long insisted OPEC would limit output only if non-OPEC producers contributed. OPEC president Qatar said non-OPEC producers had agreed to reduce output by a further 0.6 million bpd, of which Russia would contribute some 0.3 million. Russia had previously resisted participating and instead pushed production to new records in recent months. “Russia will gradually cut output in the first half of 2017 by up to 300,000 barrels per day, on a tight schedule as technical capabilities allow,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said from Moscow. Novak, who spoke an hour after OPEC announced its deal, did not say from which output levels Russia would cut. Non-OPEC Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have said they might also cut. “With the deal agreed to in principle and country level quotas established, focus will now shift to implementation,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. OPEC will hold talks with non-OPEC producers on Dec. 9. The organization will also have its next meeting on May 25 to monitor the deal and could extend it for six months, Qatar said. INDONESIA SUSPENDS MEMBERSHIP Indonesia, the cartel’s only Asian member, said it would suspend its membership as it wasn’t willing to cut its production as agreed by OPEC. Slideshow (12 Images) “The meeting... requested for Indonesia to cut around 5 percent of its production or around 37,000 barrels per day... As a net oil importing country, a cut to production capacity would not benefit Indonesia,” the country’s Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry said in a statement. Indonesia has a patchy OPEC membership history. After first joining in 1962, it left in 2009 as dwindling production meant that Southeast Asia’s most populous country had become a net importer of crude oil, which is against OPEC’s statute for full membership. Despite this, it re-joined OPEC in early 2016. Indonesia’s suspension will not affect OPEC’s overall reduction as its share of cuts will be redistributed among other members. ||||| Oil prices rose to some of their highest prices of the year Thursday, building on gains made after OPEC struck a long-sought agreement to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day. U.S. crude futures briefly topped their one-year-high of 51.60, hit in October, before settling at 51.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 1.62, or 3.28%, from Wednesday’s close. Brent, the global benchmark, gained 2.10, or 4.05%, to 53.94 a barrel—the highest settlement value since August 2015. The agreement struck by representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries marked the group’s first concerted effort to slash output since 2008. Market participants were skeptical in the days leading up to the meeting that major producers would be able to put aside their differences, and the deal caught some by surprise. U.S. crude futures rose more than 9.3% Wednesday. And questions remain about whether countries will stick to the agreement. But optimism is growing that the cut, representing about 1% of global production, will help to reduce a supply glut that has depressed prices for more than two years. “Market forces have brought supply and demand back close to balance already. The cuts are more intended to accelerate the rebalancing process and in particular the drawdown of the large inventory overhang,” said Gordon Gray, global head of oil and gas equity research at HSBC . The group is expected to reassess the effectiveness of the deal in six months. Related Video Rising oil prices in the wake of OPEC's production cut could further weigh on demand among Asia's emerging energy importers, where weakening currencies have already led to higher prices. Photo: CCTV Analysts say the biggest question remains enforcement, as OPEC has no authority to make its members comply. OPEC members have a history of producing beyond their allotted quotas. Adam Longson, commodities analyst at Morgan Stanley , said that OPEC exceeded its quota by an average of 883,000 barrels a day from 2000-2008. “Do I think there’s a possibility these guys will not honor their quotas? Yes. They’ve proven in the past numerous times that they can get out of the market what they want,” said Gene McGillian, research manager for Tradition Energy. Still, analysts were hopeful that the agreement could move oil supply and demand closer together more quickly than would happen if OPEC members keep pumping at current high levels, even if the actual cuts turn out to be smaller than what was announced. “While we acknowledge that OPEC’s record of delivering on production cuts has historically been poor, on a net basis we expect this to tighten crude markets,” said Scott Darling, the head of Asia-Pacific oil and gas research at J.P. Morgan . An OPEC news conference on Wednesday. Photo: Bloomberg News And some said markets have been buoyed by the signal that OPEC is returning to its policy of taking collective action to keep prices from cratering—a reversal from two years ago when the group essentially lifted all output quotas, allowing more supply to come to an already flooded market. “Although this may seem like a drop in the bucket of rebalancing the global supply/demand equation, the coordination seems to be enough for the markets to hang their hat on for now,” analysts at TAC Energy wrote in a research note Thursday. Higher prices, however, are likely to cause more U.S. shale producers to increase production. The latest production data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. production increased by 9,000 barrels a day to 8.7 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 25. “There is a real risk that higher prices could reactivate more dormant shale oil,” said ANZ Research, which expects international oil prices to hit strong resistance at around 60 a barrel in early 2017. Another wild card is the cooperation of non-OPEC producers, which are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day. Russia said it would cut production by 300,000 barrels a day, though it isn’t clear how much of that will come from already expected declines. “In fact, we’re not even fully confident that Russia will freeze production, particularly if the market tempts them with higher prices,” said Tim Evans, a Citi Futures analyst.

Hsu at jenny.hsu@wsj.com ||||| It is not often that the interests of an industry cartel and the global environment are aligned, but the Opec agreement to limit oil production may prove to be just one. The agreement, for the first cut in eight years, had an immediate impact on the oil market. The benchmark Brent crude rose by about 8 per cent to more than 50 a barrel. Since the dollar has been strengthening this year – it touched a 14-year high earlier this month – the underlying rise in the price of oil has been even greater. The decision is welcome in a number of ways. For a start, it shows that two historic enemies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are able to settle their differences for the oil industry’s greater good. And it shows that Iraq can be swept into a wider agreement. All this bodes well for stability in a notoriously unstable region. In addition, higher prices will feed through into other energy prices, and into the global supply chain. Petroleum is an important chemical feedstock. Under normal circumstances more expensive energy and higher inflation would be unwelcome. But in the present world of falling prices in many countries and zero or near-zero interest rates, a little inflation would be helpful. It would reinforce the return to more normal financial conditions associated with a fiscal stimulus in the US and elsewhere. But perhaps the most solid reason for welcoming higher oil prices would be the support it will give to the renewable energy industries. The more expensive oil and gas are, the greater the financial pressure to shift to non-carbon alternatives. At the moment most alternative sources of energy require subsidies to make them competitive. The price of alternatives – solar power in particular – is falling fast and the world is already close to the point where in some regions no subsidies will be required. The declining cost of electricity storage further increases the attraction of non-carbon energy. The higher the oil and gas prices, the closer that tipping point. The rise in the oil price, if sustained, will have two other substantial effects: it will help shore up public finances in Russia; and it will support uplift in oil production in the US. Russia depends on energy and raw material exports, which together account for some 80 per cent of its foreign currency earnings. It is also a vital source of tax revenue. It has been calculated that to balance its budget, Russia needs an oil price of around 100 a barrel. That may be too high, and in any case it will have been reduced the fall of the rouble. Nevertheless the plain truth is that more expensive oil will bring financial relief to Russia, though quite how it responds in political terms is unclear. As for the US, its shale oil industry has been the main force disrupting the global oil balance – without it, the collapse of the oil price two years ago would hardly have happened. Now there will be some recovery of production and that will limit the climb. But that, surely, is not a bad outcome for the world as a whole: more expensive oil, but not so expensive as to disrupt the world economy. Opec may for once have done the world a good turn. ||||| FILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, file photo, Leon Balagula changes the price for the gasoline at his Sunoco station in the early morning, in Fort Lee, N.J.

OPEC’s decision on Wednesday, Nov. 30,... (Associated Press) DALLAS (AP) — OPEC's decision to cut production gave an immediate boost to oil prices, but the impact on consumers and the U.S. economy is likely to be more modest and gradual. The cartel agreed Wednesday to cut output by 1.2 million barrels a day, reversing a strategy that produced lower oil prices and pain for U.S. drillers but saved money for consumers. Even if OPEC members carry through on their promises, global oil production would only fall by about 1 percent. There is still more supply than demand — the reason oil prices collapsed beginning in mid-2014. The price of oil shot up 9 percent to near 50 a barrel. If the price keeps rising, some of the slack from OPEC cuts will be picked up by producers in the United States — good news for drillers and oilfield workers in Texas and North Dakota. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to increase drilling in the U.S., the world's third-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and Russia, which would help ensure there is plenty of oil. In short, analysts say, consumers and businesses are not likely to see the return of 100-a-barrel oil — and the high energy costs that came with it — anytime soon. Still, there could be some short-term shocks even before OPEC's cuts take effect in January. \\"The average Joe filling up his tank may notice in the next week or two that gas prices move higher by 5 to 15 cents a gallon just on the psyche of the deal,\\" said Patrick DeHaan, an analyst for GasBuddy, a site used to comparison-shop for gasoline. The U.S. Energy Department predicts that heating oil costs will rise about one-third this winter, but that prediction was issued more than a month ago and was based heavily on forecasts of much colder temperatures in the Northeast. If the weather forecast proves wrong, prices could sink because heating-oil inventories are running above their 5-year average and grew again last week. A small increase in gasoline or even a bigger jump in heating oil, which is used in only 5 percent of American homes, won't affect shoppers if the economy does well, in the view of Michael Niemira, chief economist at The Retail Economist LLC, which does a weekly retail-sales report with Goldman Sachs. \\"The consumer isn't really focused on gasoline since prices remain low. A better economy, a better labor market — those matter much more,\\" Niemira said. But if gasoline spikes to 4, \\"that could be bad. \\" Crude has traded between 40 and 50 a barrel the last several months. The national average for gasoline on Wednesday stood at 2.15 a gallon, according to the AAA auto club. Before the OPEC meeting, the U.S. Energy Department predicted that crude would rise to 50 or 51 a barrel next year. Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said modestly higher oil prices will actually help the U.S. economy by spurring investment in the energy industry without draining consumers' purchasing power. He expects an average price of about 53 a barrel next year as a result of the OPEC production cuts. \\"The losers are Europe and Japan — oil-importing regions of the world,\\" Guatieri said. U.S. producers are likely to be winners. Drilling fell off after oil prices started to slide in mid-2014. The number of active U.S. drilling rigs bottomed out at 404 in May and has been rising since, to just below 600 last week. That's still down 20 percent from a year ago, however. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently surveyed producers and found that most believe crude must be 55 or higher before drilling picks up significantly, said Michael Plante, an economist for the bank. The Energy Department predicts that U.S. production will fall from 9.4 million barrels a day in 2015 to 8.8 million this year and 8.7 million next year — the forecast assumed oil at 50 a barrel next year. Research firm IHS Inc. estimates that if crude rises to 55, U.S. production will instead grow by about 500,000 barrels a day — offsetting nearly half of OPEC's stated cut. Much of that production is expected to come from the Permian Basin in Texas, where prices for acquiring oilfield acreage have skyrocketed in recent months. There are now almost as many drilling rigs running in the Permian as in the rest of the country combined, including offshore. \\"A few months ago rigs were being stacked on the side of roads,\\" said Avi Mirman, CEO of Lilis Energy Inc., a small producer that operates in the Permian and the Rockies. \\"Today it's almost impossible to get a hot rig\\" with a crew. Mirman is facing higher costs for materials used for hydraulic-fracturing or fracking, a technique to boost well production. The specialty firms that do the fracking have raised prices because \\"they are booked out through June or July. It's pretty wild.\\" ___ AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists.

Such programmes can discern undisclosed private information such as Facebook users' sexuality, drug-use habits and even whether their parents separated when they were young, according to the study by Cambridge university academics. In one of the biggest studies of its kind, scientists from the university's psychometrics team and a Microsoft-funded research centre analysed data from 58,000 Facebook users to predict traits and other information that were not provided in their profiles. The algorithms were 88 per cent accurate in predicting male sexual orientation, 95 per cent for race and 80 per cent for religion and political leanings. Personality types and emotional stability were also predicted with accuracy ranging from 62-75 per cent. Facebook declined to comment. The study highlights growing concerns about social networks and how data trails can be mined for sensitive information, even when people attempt to keep information about themselves private. Less than 5 per cent of users predicted to be gay, for example, were connected with explicitly gay groups. Michal Kosinksi, one of the report's authors, told the Financial Times that the university's techniques could easily be replicated by companies to infer personal attributes a person did not wish to share, such as sexual orientation or political views: \\"We used very simple and generic methods. Marketing companies and internet companies could spend much more time and resources, and hence get much higher accuracy than we did.\\" Last week , the EU agreed to water down proposals for a radical overhaul of data privacy regulation.

With Asian manufacturing exporters penetrating markets worldwide, such a development would be highly damaging to Latin America’s growth prospects. Translate to German German:","completion":"Mit dem Eindringen asiatischer Fertigungsexporteure in Märkte weltweit wäre eine solche Entwicklung äußerst schädlich für die Wachstumsaussichten Lateinamerikas. Die zunehmende Präsenz asiatischer Hersteller, insbesondere aus China und anderen aufstrebenden Wirtschaftsmächten in der Region, hat in den letzten Jahren auf globaler Ebene für Furore gesorgt. Dabei haben diese Unternehmen eine breite Palette von Produkten und Dienstleistungen angeboten, die in verschiedenen Branchen und Sektoren, von Elektronik, Kleidung, Automobilindustrie bis hin zu erneuerbaren Energien und Infrastrukturentwicklung reichen. Für Lateinamerika bedeutet dies jedoch, dass es mit einem harten Wettbewerb konfrontiert ist, um seinen angestammten Platz in den globalen Märkten zu halten oder sogar zu verbessern. Es gibt mehrere Faktoren, die diese wachsende Herausforderung für Lateinamerika erklären: 1. Die geografische Nähe zu den USA: Lateinamerika hat traditionell von seiner Nähe zu den Vereinigten Staaten profitiert, die sowohl ein wichtiger Handelspartner als auch eine Quelle für Investitionen und Technologie waren. Mit dem Aufstieg asiatischer Hersteller haben jedoch auch diese Länder begonnen, die lukrativen US-Märkte zu erschließen, was den lateinamerikanischen Exporteuren erhebliche Marktanteile kostet. 2. Niedrigere Produktionskosten: Asiatische Länder wie China, Vietnam und Indien haben im Vergleich zu lateinamerikanischen Ländern oft niedrigere Produktionskosten. Dies ist in erster Linie auf eine relativ günstige Arbeitskraft zurückzuführen, die diese Länder aufgrund ihrer großen Bevölkerungen und eines niedrigen Lohnniveaus anbieten können. Dadurch sind die asiatischen Produzenten in der Lage, ihre Produkte zu wettbewerbsfähigeren Preisen anzubieten und damit auch Kunden in Lateinamerika zu gewinnen. 3. Technologie und Innovation: Asiatische Hersteller haben in den letzten Jahren enorme Fortschritte in den Bereichen Technologie und Innovation erzielt. Dies hat es ihnen ermöglicht, qualitativ hochwertige, technisch anspruchsvolle und gleichzeitig preisgünstige Produkte zu entwickeln, die viele Verbraucher weltweit ansprechen. 4. Attraktive Handelsabkommen: Asiatische Länder haben zunehmend Handelsabkommen mit Ländern in Nord- und Südamerika abgeschlossen, die den Marktzugang für ihre Produkte verbessern. Dies hat auch zu einer Zunahme des Handelsvolumens zwischen Asien und Lateinamerika geführt, wodurch die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der lateinamerikanischen Exporteure beeinträchtigt wird. Angesichts dieser Faktoren müssen lateinamerikanische Länder nachhaltige Strategien entwickeln, um ihre Wachstumsaussichten aufrechtzuerhalten oder zu verbessern. Dies kann unter anderem durch den Ausbau der eigenen Produktionskapazitäten, die Einführung neuer Technologien sowie die Förderung von Bildung und Fachkräftetraining geschehen. Darüber hinaus sollten sie ihre Wettbewerbsvorteile nutzen und auf Diversifikation und Spezialisierung ihrer Wirtschaft hinwirken, um ihre Position in den globalen Märkten langfristig zu stärken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: how many roses are in the kentucky derby blanket?","completion":"The Kentucky Derby blanket, commonly known as the Garland of Roses, is an iconic symbol awarded to the winner of the annual Kentucky Derby horse race. This prestigious event takes place on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The Garland of Roses consists of a delicate arrangement of the freshest, most vibrant red roses, intricately sewn together on a green satin backing and measures approximately 122 inches long and 22 inches wide. The number of roses used in the Kentucky Derby blanket has evolved over the years, but the current design consists of 554 roses. Among these, 436 roses form the center part of the garland, and a solitary rose representing the \\"heart\\" is placed in the center, pointing backward toward the horse's tail as a symbolic representation of the struggle that goes into becoming a Kentucky Derby-winning horse and team. Surrounding the 436 roses and the \\"heart\\" rose, a border of 112 roses is sewn on. The entire blanket is held together by thousands of stitches to ensure the roses stay intact during the ceremony. Additionally, each rose features a hidden water vial that provides moisture to the flowers, helping them remain fresh throughout the celebration. Along with the Garland of Roses, the winning horse also receives a trophy, and their owner is presented with a smaller arrangement known as the \\"julep vase bouquet.\\" This bouquet typically contains 60 roses. The tradition of the winning horse being adorned with a rose blanket began in 1896, but the current design was first created in 1932 and has been presented to the winners ever since. The roses used in the Garland are usually sourced from Kroger Company's design team, a task they have been handling since 1987. Preparing the Garland of Roses typically requires around 10-12 hours of work, with a team carefully selecting and hand-sewing each flower into the arrangement the night before the race. In conclusion, the Kentucky Derby Garland of Roses, or the iconic blanket, comprises 554 roses: 436 roses in the center, 112 roses in the border, and one \\"heart\\" rose in the middle as a symbol of the hard work and dedication of the winning horse and team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: As serials go \\"Zorro's Fighting Legion\\" is one of the best action serials of the 1930s. Made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast, this one has wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters. In 1824 the President of the newly formed Republic of Mexico Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) is trying to put his new country on a solid financial footing. To that end, he has arranged to have rich gold shipments forwarded to the capitol from the local San Mendolita mine. Members of the local council plot to steal the shipments on behalf of Don-del-Oro a gold armored god, who with the aid of the local Yaqui tribe, hopes to install himself as the ruler of Mexico. Opposing him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who forms a legion of locals to aid Juarez. When Don Franciso is murdered by Don-del-Oro's men, a stranger, the fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in town. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The token heroine of the piece is Ramon's sister Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). Both Diego and Ramon hold seats on the local ruling Counsil. It soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the Council are in league with Don-del-Oro. First there is the Chairman of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? What follows are several hair raising escapes by Zorro and his confederates from the followers of Don-del-Oro. We have the ever present collapsing rope bridge, the deep chasm between two cliffs over which only Zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and wagons crashing or going over the cliff. Hats off here to Republic's fine team of stunt men lead by the legendary Yakima Canutt and the Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling beneath the coach which he repeated in other films including John Ford's \\"Stagecoach\\" the same year. Anyway, Zorro finally unmasks the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace to the valley before riding off into the sunset in Chapter 12. Others in the cast include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro's hence men and if you look closely you may spot bits by future serial star and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stuntman Canutt in bits. \\"Big\\" Jim Pierce by the way, may be best remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927's \\"Tarzan and the Golden Liom\\" (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs the daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was.

Question: What women were Scout's role models? Context: Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\" Answer:","completion":"Scout's role models were Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The body of a child who was dragged away by the swift currents was recovered Saturday evening. The drownings happened after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours in North Carolina's Piedmont region, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County. First responders stayed busy racing to save people stuck in fast-moving waters and closed dozens of roads Saturday because of major flooding. Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together -- were both swimming in what is known as the \\"bathtub\\" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. Rain, which had already stopped, raised Wilson Creek 2 feet above normal levels and created \\"very swift currents,\\" according to a statement from the sheriff's department. Kayakers found Delilah's body nearly an hour after she disappeared, it said. Search and rescue crews found Alberdi on Sunday, about a quarter mile north of where they were first told he went into the water, according to LouAnne Kincaid, a spokeswoman for Caldwell County. Catawba County officials reported 10 swiftwater rescues for residents needing help getting out of their homes and vehicles Saturday afternoon, said Mark Pettit, an emergency official in the county. Some 52 roads in the inland county had been closed at that point, six of which might not see any traffic for as long as three months, according to Pettit.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of the two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land? Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

To break down the statement, we can create a list of facts: 1. There's a man (Man 1) who is playing a purple guitar. 2. There's another man (Man 2) who is playing the accordion. 3. Both of them are sitting next to each other. Now, to analyze whether it logically follows that \\"A man plays music,\\" let's examine each fact separately: 1. A man (Man 1) who is playing a purple guitar – For someone to play a guitar, regardless of its color, they would need to engage in the act of creating music. A guitar is a musical instrument, and playing it produces musical sounds, which in turn can be considered as music. 2. Another man (Man 2) who is playing the accordion – Similarly, an accordion is also a musical instrument, and when played, it generates music. As such, it is clear that Man 2 is also engaging in the act of creating music by playing the accordion. Since both individuals are either playing the guitar or the accordion, they are actively involved in the process of making music. Thus, even without considering fact 3 (both of them sitting next to each other), it is evident that \\"A man plays music\\" based on the information given in the original statement. It doesn't matter which man we choose as our subject (either Man 1 or Man 2); they both suffice as examples of a man playing music.

(CNN)The U.S. is turning to a familiar -- but some would say unexpected -- name to lead its team at the next Ryder Cup: Davis Love III. Yes, even though Love was the losing captain as Europe rallied in 2012 in the Miracle at Medinah in Illinois, the 50-year-old will succeed Tom Watson at the 2016 edition at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He'll go up against Darren Clarke, who last week got the nod for Europe. Love was unveiled Tuesday, about five months after the PGA of America set up a Ryder Cup task force in the wake of another loss to Europe in golf's most prestigious team event. Love himself was part of the 11-person committee, joining the likes of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and past captains Tom Lehman and Raymond Floyd. Love named Lehman as a vice-captain. \\"I am here with the same goal as in 2012 but not as the same captain,\\" Love told reporters. \\"It is a great honor to be in the position to help build the team, but our mission doesn't end there. What we accomplish in 2016 at Hazeltine must serve as the foundation for future USA Ryder Cup teams,\\" Love said separately in a statement. The 2012 Ryder Cup will no doubt serve as motivation. With the U.S. seemingly coasting to victory -- holding a 10-6 lead entering the final day -- Europe won eight of the last 12 matches to eke out a 14 1/2-13 1/2 win. And when the U.S. was unable to overturn its skid last year at Gleneagles in Scotland, it meant a sixth defeat in the last seven Ryder Cups. Given the record it's not surprising that criticism followed, but no one quite expected Mickelson to lay into Watson -- who was yards away -- at a post series press conference. Mickelson attended Tuesday's press conference with Love. Woods skipped the 2014 Ryder Cup as he recovered from a back injury and who knows if the slumping 14-time major champion will return next year. He's currently taking a break from golf. He, though, gave his backing to Love. \\"I want to congratulate Davis on his selection,\\" Woods said in a statement. \\"I have great respect for him as a person, player and captain. I know he'll do an outstanding job leading the 2016 U.S. team. \\"I'm proud of what the task force accomplished, making substantive changes in the Captain's selection process and qualifying system.\\" As a player, Love played in six Ryder Cups and compiled a singles record of three wins and a loss, halving two matches.

In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Now, I have a new situation: Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal. Answer this question please: Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Answer:","completion":"Iron corrosion is a complex process influenced by various factors, such as humidity, temperature, exposure to air and water, and presence of impurities. In your given situation, you have two distinct environments – a desert and a rain forest – where iron corrosion could occur differently. To answer your question, it is essential to examine the corrosion process in each of these environments and compare the rates of corrosion. In a desert environment, iron is exposed to dry and hot conditions. The low humidity levels may slow down the process of corrosion, as the availability of water and oxygen might be limited. However, the high temperature can speed up the oxidation process to some extent. Additionally, the presence of sand particles can cause abrasion on the iron surface, making it more susceptible to corrosion over time. Even though the corrosion process might be relatively slower in a desert compared to other environments, it is important to recognize that the iron still corrodes, albeit at a reduced rate. In a rainforest environment, the conditions are in stark contrast to those in a desert. High humidity levels, high temperatures, and the frequent rainfall provide plenty of water and oxygen needed for the redox reactions in the corrosion process. The iron in a rainforest is exposed to a higher concentration of moisture, which accelerates the rusting process because of the continuous contact with water and air. Also, if there are other impurities present like chlorides or organic acids, the corrosion rate can further increase. Consequently, the damp conditions in a rainforest are significantly more conducive to iron corrosion. Comparing these two environments, it is evident that iron left in a damp area like a rainforest will corrode much faster compared to iron in a dry area like a desert. This is because the rainforest conditions are more favorable for the redox reactions to occur due to the constant exposure to water and oxygen, leading to the rapid formation of rust. In the situation with the sailors, Jim and Eric, who decide to buy boats with a significant amount of iron in their construction, it is crucial to consider the potential for corrosion. Jim's decision to coat his boat in a protective seal that prevents air and water contact with the iron surface is wise, as it will help slow down or even prevent the corrosion process. On the other hand, Eric's decision to avoid using a protective seal leaves his boat more vulnerable to corrosion, especially if exposed to a damp environment such as a rainforest. In conclusion, rusting or iron corrosion is an ubiquitous phenomenon, and its rate varies depending on the environment and the conditions. Iron in damp areas like rainforests corrodes faster than iron in dry areas such as deserts due to the differences in the availability of moisture and oxygen. Protective measures, like the sealant applied by Jim, can help reduce the corrosion rate and prolong the lifespan of structures made of iron or other susceptible metals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A joint German–Soviet parade was held in Lvov and Brest-Litovsk, while the countries commanders met in the latter location. Stalin had decided in August that he was going to liquidate the Polish state, and a German–Soviet meeting in September addressed the future structure of the \\"Polish region\\".

Where in the British Isles can the Laxey Wheel aka Lady Isabella be seen?","completion":"The Laxey Wheel, also known as Lady Isabella, can be found in the village of Laxey in the Isle of Man, a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. The Isle of Man falls within the geographical grouping of the British Isles, even though it maintains its own governance and is not part of the United Kingdom. Built in 1854, the Laxey Wheel is the largest working waterwheel in the world, with a diameter of 72 feet and 6 inches and a circumference of 227 feet. Renowned engineer Robert Casement designed the wheel, aiming to extract water from the surrounding mines, particularly from the Great Laxey Mine, a substantial zinc and lead mine. The wheel was named Lady Isabella in honor of the wife of Lieutenant Governor Charles Hope, the then-governor of the Isle of Man. The wheel's design is an elegant example of Victorian engineering. It features a 44-step spiral staircase that climbs alongside the wheel, allowing visitors to ascend and witness panoramic views of the Laxey Valley. The wheel lifts about 250 gallons of water per minute from the mine. The Laxey Wheel operates primarily through the energies of its fast-flowing river, which descends a mountainside and passes beneath the wheel, propelling the various gears and mechanisms. The force generated is distributed mechanically through a series of rods known as \\"flat rods,\\" directing the energy to the mine and powering several massive water pumps used to extract water. This clever engineering feat ensured that the mines remained operational, extending their productive life and supporting the Isle of Man's economy. Today, the Laxey Wheel stands as a monument to the Isle's industrial heritage and is an exceptional tourist attraction. Visitors can explore the wheel and its surrounding gardens, learning about the history of mining on the Isle of Man. In addition, visitors can venture into a section of the Great Laxey Mine and view the wheel's 150-year-old inner workings. In conclusion, the Laxey Wheel, or Lady Isabella, is located in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man within the British Isles. This impressive waterwheel showcases the ingenuity of Victorian engineering and is an iconic symbol of the island's industrial past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .","completion":"The given phrase can be interpreted as having a predominantly negative connotation. This interpretation stems from the mention of a specific problem or issue, which generally evokes an unfavorable response. The phrase specifically refers to \\"ardently Christian storylines,\\" suggesting that the focus is on stories that have deeply rooted Christian themes or messages. The use of the term \\"ardently\\" implies that these storylines can be rigid and strongly adherent to Christian values or teachings. In identifying the problem with such storylines, the phrase states that \\"there is never any question of how things will turn out.\\" This essentially means that the outcome is predictable, with little to no uncertainty, and often adheres to a specific moral framework. Predictability in storytelling is generally perceived negatively, as it may cause readers or audiences to lose interest, knowing that the narrative arc will follow a pre-determined path. However, it is essential to consider the context and background of the person evaluating the phrase. Some individuals may appreciate the comforting and familiar nature of predictable storylines rooted in their religious beliefs. For them, the phrase might lose its negative connotation, and instead only highlight a known characteristic of these narratives. In contrast, others who may not share these beliefs or appreciate traditional storytelling frameworks may view the phrase as more decidedly negative. Furthermore, the phrase can initiate a discussion on broader subjects, such as the diversity and inclusivity in storytelling. A perceived lack of narrative variety in ardently Christian storylines may limit opportunities for exploring other perspectives and values, effectively narrowing the scope of collective literary experiences. In conclusion, the phrase \\"one key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out\\" can be considered negative as it identifies a specific issue, i.e., predictability. The context and personal beliefs of the person evaluating the phrase may, however, influence the extent to which it may be perceived as negative. The phrase could also serve as a conversation starter for diving deeper into discussions about diversity in storytelling and the universality of certain themes and messages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is under house arrest and must wear an ankle monitor, according to the Dallas Morning News. Armaan, who has undergone three heart surgeries, was taken away in handcuffs, according to the paper. “I was really scared, really nervous,” said Armaan of the arrest. Another unidentified student claimed Armaan told him he had a bomb in his backpack and would detonate it in the bathroom, said Lieutenant Christopher Cook of the Arlington Police Department. Armaan admitted that he made the joke after the classmate told him he thought a phone battery in his backpack looked like a bomb. The following day, the classmate in the pre-AP history class said he was going to report him, he told the newspaper. “I thought it was a joke, so I started laughing and he started laughing,” Armaan told the newspaper. “The next thing you know, I’m reading with my friend and police come in, grab me and take me outside.” Authorities evacuated the classroom, which included 16 students and a teacher, until it was determined there was no bomb. Armaan's family claims that it was the classmate who was behind the prank, but cops saw it differently. Lt. Cook said that the other student \\"became so frightened that he went to the nurse’s office and was 'trembling.'\\" Cops say Armaan made the first threat on Dec. 10, but it was never reported to the school or authorities. The boy made the threat again the next day, going into \\"more detail on how he would actually blow up the school,\\" cops said. A cousin of Armaan placed the blame solely on the \\"bully\\" classmate earlier this week. \\"It hurts my heart and boils my blood that there are people stupid enough out there not only accusing us, but our innocent children of being terrorists!\\" Ginee Haer wrote. However, cops claim Armaan never told officers he was being \\"bullied.\\" Armaan's parents said they had to call 911 to find out where their son was being held after they were not notified that he was in custody, the Dallas Morning News reported. The family was also upset that Armaan had to spend the weekend in custody with more hardened criminals. “We’re those kind of people who, if it was his fault, would let him stay in there so he could learn his lesson,” brother Aksh, 17, told the newspaper. The family had moved from San Antonio in August. Armaan's parents came to the U.S. from India in 1997, the Dallas Morning News reported. “It was my decision to move here, but now I’m thinking why we came here,” Armaan's mother Gurdeep Kaur told the newspaper about the decision to move to the Arlington area.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

However, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't keep quiet anymore. Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante, \\"The Rectifier\\", and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding. I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. Yes, we're all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's eye-rolling. Robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However... the transformation doesn't take place. He just renames himself. I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesn't help either. Overall, I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. Just one guy's opinion, cheers.

Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation. Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that \\"I’ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust.\\"Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages. Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video. Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour. The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery. And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively. Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in \\"stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork\\". DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

It acknowledges the challenges that come with the development and establishment of democratic institutions, while also highlighting the inner drive and aspirations for freedom that Iranians hold. The mention of Payami, presumably a form of media or content, visually depicting the issues associated with new democracies, brings attention to the flaws and potential downsides of democratic experiments. The phrase \\"fledgling democracies\\" suggests that these political systems are in their infancy and have room for growth and improvement.

It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces.

The addition of Robshaw's expertise and Underhill's fresh talent is expected to significantly strengthen the team dynamics as they prepare to take on their Argentine rivals. Chris Robshaw, the 35-year-old Harlequin flanker, is no stranger to the international rugby scene. Over the years, he has earned a reputation for his unparalleled leadership skills and relentless energy. With 66 international caps to his name, his return is a major boost to the England back row, which has faced significant challenges since his departure. Robshaw’s return to the pitch brings a wealth of experience coupled with a deep understanding of game tactics and strategy –remarkable qualities that will undoubtedly benefit the team. Coach Eddie Jones' decision to pair Chris Robshaw with Sam Underhill, a newcomer to the international rugby arena, speaks volumes about the potential he sees in the young player. At only 24 years old, Underhill is already an accomplished open-side flanker, having delivered impressive performances for Bath in the Premiership and the Wales U18 squad. Underhill's hard-hitting tackles and fearless approach to the game make him a promising addition to the England back row, with plenty to contribute right from the outset. The combination of Robshaw's experience and Underhill's raw talent is precisely what the England Rugby Team needs ahead of the second Test with Argentina. The Argentine side has proven to be a challenging foe, with their dynamic and aggressive style of play. England's back row will have a major task on their hands, ensuring they control the game and impose their style on the match, all while maintaining a solid defensive line to protect their territory. This partnership also appears to be an investment in the future, as Robshaw's experienced guidance can contribute to the burgeoning career of the young debutant. As Underhill finds his footing on the international stage, he will have a reliable mentor in Robshaw to guide him through the difficulties and complexities that come with participation in elite-level rugby. This collaboration is expected to foster an ideal environment for Underhill to thrive and develop as a key asset for the England Rugby Team. Apart from this noteworthy back row pairing, other significant changes and selections are expected for the upcoming Test match against Argentina. Coach Eddie Jones will have to strike a delicate balance between ensuring continuity of his winning team and making critical adjustments to counter the Argentine threat. The broader squad changes will have to be carefully crafted to create a synchronized and harmonious setup that can orchestrate a hard-fought victory on the pitch. In conclusion, the England Rugby Team's back row of Chris Robshaw and debutant Sam Underhill is anticipated to bring a positive impact on the team's performance during the second Test with Argentina. As the two distinct yet complementary talents come together, this powerful combination presents a formidable force for the England side. Both rugby enthusiasts and experts await with great intrigue to see how this double-edged sword will cut through Argentina's defenses and contribute to England's bid for victory."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the question \\"What does the woman want?\\" and the answer \\"A room for herself alone.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Options are: + tired; + awake; + lethargic; Answer:","completion":"Taking into consideration the context provided, Skylar was feeling tired and decided to take a nap to refresh themselves. Naps can often be a beneficial solution to improve alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. The potential outcomes for Skylar after their nap depend on various factors such as the duration, quality, and timing of the nap. If Skylar took a short power nap of approximately 10-20 minutes, there is a higher chance that they would feel more awake, alert, and refreshed. Short naps allow the body to rest and recharge without entering deep sleep cycles, which can lead to feelings of grogginess or lethargy upon awakening. In this case, Skylar's choice to nap would be effective in fulfilling their objective of feeling refreshed, and \\"awake\\" would be the most suitable answer. However, if Skylar took a longer nap exceeding 30 minutes, the outcome could be quite different. Although longer naps allow the body to enter deep sleep cycles, which can be beneficial for overall sleep health, they could also result in a feeling of sleep inertia or grogginess upon awakening, potentially leaving Skylar feeling lethargic. It is also possible that a longer nap in the late afternoon or evening could disrupt Skylar's normal sleep pattern, making it difficult for them to fall asleep at night, and resulting in continued tiredness. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to how Skylar would feel after their nap would depend on the specifics of their nap. However, assuming that the purpose of the nap was to feel refreshed and reenergized, it is more likely that Skylar would be feeling \\"awake\\" after their nap. Of course, individual responses to napping can vary, and Skylar's personal sleep needs and habits would also play a role in determining the effectiveness of their nap session."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve 3174*j - 3161*j = 50 - 245 for j. And the answer is...","completion":"Okay, first let's simplify the equation by combining the \\"j\\" terms and the numbers. 3174*j - 3161*j means we have 3174 groups of something (let's say apples) minus 3161 groups of apples. Now, if we take away 3161 groups from 3174 groups, we are left with 13 groups of apples. So, the simplified equation will be: 13*j = 50 - 245 Next, let's simplify the numbers on the right side of the equation. If we have 50 apples and we want to take away 245 apples, we will be short of 195 apples. So, the new equation will be: 13*j = -195 Now, we will find the value of \\"j\\". To do that, we will divide the -195 apples into 13 groups. It's like sharing -195 apples among 13 friends equally. -195 ÷ 13 = -15 So, j = -15 And that's the answer! j is -15 in this equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Jacarandas thrive with sun, and should be planted in an area that will receive frequent, direct sunlight for most of the year. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from any nearby buildings, and do not plant seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees. Jacaranda trees will suffer if their roots don’t drain well, and they need fertile, rich soil to provide them with nutrients. If you’re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda. If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you’ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery. Look for a patch of soil that isn’t prone to having puddles and has other plants already growing in it. Jacarandas need frequent watering in order to grow and thrive in temperate climates. Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week. During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month. Although they begin small as seedlings, jacarandas can grow into massive trees. Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters). Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards. If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from homes and other structures so that falling branches are less likely to cause damage. Summary:","completion":"To successfully grow jacaranda trees, plant them in sunny locations with well-draining, fertile soil, at least 15 feet away from structures, provide regular watering during warmer months, and ensure enough space for them to reach their full size of up to 50 feet in height and 30 feet in width."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trying to snap a five-game losing streak, the Rams stayed at home for a Week 13 interconference duel with the Miami Dolphins. The Rams would welcome back Steven Jackson to the lineup after weeks of sitting out with a thigh injury. Jackson gave the Rams a good enough boost to strike first with a first possession field goal by Josh Brown from 23 yards. Brown would kick a 51-yard field goal to give the Rams a 6-0 lead. In the second quarter, the Dolphins responded as RB Ronnie Brown got a 3-yard TD run. The Rams would answer with Brown making a 33-yard field goal, but Miami replied with kicker Dan Carpenter getting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Dolphins increased their lead as Carpenter got a 47-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis tried to keep up as Brown made a 38-yard field goal, yet Miami answered right back with Carpenter nailing a 42-yard field goal. The Rams tried to come back, but a late-game interception shattered any hope of a comeback. Answer this question: How many yards was the mean value of all field goals kicked in the game?","completion":"To calculate the mean value of all field goals kicked in the game, we need to add up the yardage of all field goals and divide it by the total number of field goals. Josh Brown kicked field goals of 23 yards, 51 yards, 33 yards, and 38 yards. Dan Carpenter kicked field goals of 37 yards, 47 yards, and 42 yards. Step 1: Add up the yardage of all field goals: 23 + 51 + 33 + 38 + 37 + 47 + 42 = 271 yards Step 2: Count the total number of field goals: There are 4 field goals by Josh Brown and 3 field goals by Dan Carpenter, for a total of 7 field goals.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio? Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of drug rehabilitation at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio. The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.\\" Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, \\"writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.\\" Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. The answer is:","completion":"The name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio is the Chili Peppers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - A guided-missile destroyer is a destroyer designed to launch guided missiles. Many are also equipped to carry out anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface operations. The NATO standard designation for these vessels is DDG. Nations vary in their use of destroyer D designation in their hull pennant numbering, either prefixing, or dropping it altogether. The U.S. Navy has adopted the classification DDG in the American hull classification system. - The 18 Forrest Sherman - class destroyers were the first US post-war destroyers ( DD - 927 to DD - 930 were completed as destroyer leaders ) . Commissioned beginning in 1953 , these ships served until the late 1980s . Their weaponry underwent considerable modification during their years of service . Four were converted to guided missile destroyers . This class also served as the basis for the Charles F. Adams - class guided missile destroyer . Three ships of the class have become museum ships , nine have been sunk in training exercises , and the others have been scrapped or are scheduled to be scrapped . - The Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 5 September 1905) was fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea. - In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \\"torpedo boat destroyers\\" (TBD) were \\"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats.\\" Although the term \\"destroyer\\" had been used interchangeably with \\"TBD\\" and \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" by navies since 1892, the term \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" had been generally shortened to simply \\"destroyer\\" by nearly all navies by the First World War. - Destroyer Leader (DL) was the United States Navy designation for large destroyers from 9 February 1951 through the early years of the cold war. United States ships with hull classification symbol DL were officially frigates from 1 January 1955 until 1975. The smaller destroyer leaders were reclassified as destroyers and the larger as cruisers by the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification; so destroyer escorts could be reclassified as frigates (FF) in conformance with international usage of the term. Background. By the end of World War I the destroyers intended to screen formations of battleships had evolved to a displacement of approximately 1100 tons armed with four guns and six or more torpedoes. Italy had built three \\"esploratori\\" (scout cruisers) approximately 70% larger than contemporary destroyers. The Washington Naval Treaty encouraged United Kingdom satisfaction with its traditional fleet of s and United States contentment with similar and s, while the signatories with smaller fleets explored alternative warship configurations between the classical definitions of destroyer and cruiser. Italy launched three more \\"esploratori\\" and France responded with six \\"Chacal\\"-class \\"contre-torpilleur\\" super destroyers. Japan launched the minimum light cruiser followed by the \\"Fubuki\\"-class special type destroyers with endurance to escort the \\"Kido Butai\\" mobile force of aircraft carriers over the wide reaches of the Pacific. - In the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations, ships are identified by pennant number (an internationalisation of \\"pendant number\\", which it was called before 1948). Historically, naval ships flew a flag that identified a flotilla or type of vessel. For example, the Royal Navy used a red burgee for torpedo boats and a pennant with an H for torpedo boat destroyers. Adding a number to the type-identifying flag uniquely identified each ship. What is the relationship between 'forrest sherman-class destroyer' and 'united states navy'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between the Forrest Sherman-class destroyer and the United States Navy lies in the fact that the Forrest Sherman-class destroyers were a series of warships specifically designed, built, and commissioned for use by the United States Navy. These destroyers were the first post-World War II destroyers developed by the U.S. Navy, marking a significant step in the evolution of naval warfare for the United States. The Forrest Sherman-class destroyers served the United States Navy from 1953 until the late 1980s as versatile warships capable of carrying out various naval operations. Equipped with advanced weaponry and technology, these ships were designed to provide anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface support to larger vessels in a fleet, convoy, or battle group. As such, the Forrest Sherman-class destroyers played an essential role in protecting the naval interests of the United States during the Cold War era. Throughout their years of service, the Forrest Sherman-class destroyers underwent several modifications and upgrades to enhance their capabilities. Four of the eighteen ships in the class were converted into guided missile destroyers, a testament to their adaptability as naval assets. Additionally, the Forrest Sherman-class served as the basis for the development of the subsequent Charles F. Adams-class guided missile destroyer, further solidifying its importance in U.S. naval history. In summary, the relationship between the Forrest Sherman-class destroyer and the United States Navy is that of a crucial military asset designed and employed by the U.S. Navy to protect and advance its interests during a critical period in history. These ships not only served the United States Navy but also influenced the design and capabilities of future destroyer classes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person who dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na?, using the article: The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD., what would be the answer ?

The station broadcasts Major League Baseball games as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network. Hypothesis: WSJD is under self ownership","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis that WSJD is under self ownership can indeed be drawn from the context provided. The context states clearly that WSJD (100.5 FM, \\"True Oldies 100.5\\"), a radio station serving the Evansville, Indiana area with an oldies format, is \\"under self ownership\\". This implies that the radio station operates independently, most likely meaning that it does not belong to a larger network of stations under common ownership, but instead, it owns itself. This generally means that the radio station has complete authority and control over its operations, programming, and decision-making. Additional information given in the context also suggest that apart from the station being under self ownership, it's also a part of the Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network and broadcasts Major League Baseball games. The majority of the station's programming is featured from ABC Radio's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\" satellite feed which further supports the concept of their programming independence. Take note, however, that being under \\"self ownership\\" doesn't necessarily mean that the station doesn't have partnerships or affiliations with other entities. As the context suggests, it leverages content from ABC Radio's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\" and is part of The Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network. This usually happens to enhance the station's programming and expand its reach. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the hypothesis that WSJD operates under self ownership is correct. However, it's also evident that the station collaborates with other networks for some of its content, which is a common practice in the radio industry. These partnerships shouldn't be confused with the concept of ownership, as they are usually contractual relationships that do not impact the station's overall self ownership status."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

I crashed on stage one and it just whacked me, broke a rib, hit my head and really shook me up.\\" Froome secured the yellow jersey in Saturday's penultimate stage, a 22.5km time trial in Marseille, extending his overall lead from 23 to 54 seconds with Rigoberto Uran second and Romain Bardet dropping to third. Tradition dictates that no general classification rivals attack the yellow jersey on the final stage in Paris on Sunday, meaning Froome should win the race in Paris. Geraint Thomas, Rowe's fellow rider from Cardiff - who became the first Welshman to wear the yellow jersey - was forced out with a broken collarbone after a crash on stage nine when second in the overall standings. Rowe admits that if his own crash had not been in the Tour de France, then he might also have withdrawn because of his injuries. \\"You never like to go home [early] from a race, but there's times I was in a bit of a mess, times were pretty tough,\\" Rowe admitted. \\"But when you've got the yellow jersey in the team and what I believe to be the best rider in the world, you're in that position where you've got to defend yellow. \\"The only way you go home is if you physically can't ride your bike or missed the time limit... but if it had been another race then yeah, it could have been an early taxi. \\"I knew I had a job to do and I battled through and did it. \\"The first 10-12 days I was really struggling, the toughest Grand Tour I've ever done. \\"It's been quite nice on a personal achievement to be here [at the end], to have made it to Paris.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872? is inside the article: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of..., can you guess it ?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? Options: - Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want - not enough information - More foods that are higher in protein - They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy The answer is:","completion":"More foods that are higher in protein."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This method is effective in safely picking up broken glass because the bread's soft, moist texture allows it to capture small shards and tiny glass particles that may be difficult to see or pick up with other methods. Steps on how to do this: 1. Take a slice of bread or a small piece of bread. 2. Moisten the bread slightly with water to make it damp. This will improve the bread's ability to adhere to the glass particles. However, do not make it too wet, as it may fall apart and become ineffective. 3. Carefully press the damp bread on the floor where the broken glass is located. Make sure to apply gentle, even pressure to cover as much area as possible without risking injury. 4. Slowly lift the bread, checking to see if any glass particles are stuck to it. If there is still broken glass on the floor, repeat the process with a fresh damp piece of bread. 5. Once all the visible glass shards have been picked up with the bread, thoroughly sweep or vacuum the area to ensure any remaining pieces are removed. 6. Dispose of the broken glass and the used bread in a safe manner, such as by wrapping them in newspaper or placing them in a sturdy container before putting it in the trash.

Though this could distract a driver, it is not something the driver consciously chooses to do. So, based on the logic above, the most reasonable answer seems to be \\"use mobile phone\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis? Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...

If \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush.\\", can we conclude \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\"?","completion":"From the provided statement, \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush,\\" we cannot conclusively infer that \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" The reason for this lies in the differences between the two statements and the lack of any direct correlation between them. To elaborate further, let's break down and analyze the content of the two statements. In the first statement, \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush,\\" we gather the following information: 1. There is a dog involved in the scenario. 2. The dog is brown. 3. The dog is currently engaging in an activity, specifically, bounding through the leaves and underbrush. This description paints a very specific picture of a dog and its current activity. Now let's examine the second statement, \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" 1. There is a dog involved in the scenario. 2. The dog is asleep. 3. The dog is confined within a cage. Although both statements involve a dog, the similarities effectively end there. The first statement describes a brown dog participating in an active outdoor pursuit, while the second statement refers to a dog resting indoors within a cage. Additionally, the second statement does not provide information about the color of the dog. Given the discrepancies and lack of correlation between the two statements, we cannot ascertain whether the dog in the first statement is the same dog mentioned in the second. Moreover, the context provided in the first statement does not indicate any information about the dog's sleeping habits or any eventual confinement to a cage. The two statements are entirely independent, offering us no grounds through which to connect their respective subjects or actions. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we are unable to draw the connection from \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush\\" to \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" To establish a conclusion between these statements, we would require additional context or information linking the subjects and their actions. Otherwise, as it stands, the statements provide no evidence supporting such a conclusion."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write an article based on this summary: Managerless Chesterfield came out on top in the League One relegation battle with Coventry City at the Proact Stadium, thanks to Dan Gardner's late second-half winner Article:","completion":"Title: Chesterfield Seals Crucial Victory Over Coventry City in League One Relegation Battle In a thrilling match at the Proact Stadium, managerless Chesterfield displayed resilience and determination as they secured a crucial 1-0 win over Coventry City, securing three vital points in the League One relegation battle. The match's lone goal came courtesy of Dan Gardner's late second-half winner, which sent the Chesterfield fans into celebrations. This fixture held immense importance for both sides as they continue their fight to avoid relegation from the English Football League (EFL) League One. With Chesterfield currently without a permanent manager, the tension was high as the home side looked to improve their league standing. The first half was a tightly contested affair, with both teams showing their desire for a valuable victory. Coventry City's aggressive pressing and tactical approach initially caused problems for Chesterfield's makeshift backline. However, the resilience of the Blues' defenders gradually grew with their confidence, snuffing out the Sky Blues' attacking forays and keeping them at bay. Chesterfield's attacking play in the opening period was characterized by quick bursts of pace and a willingness to shoot from distance. However, Coventry City's goalkeeper was on hand to thwart the early attempts on goal. The first half ended goalless, with both teams still searching for the elusive breakthrough. The second half commenced with renewed impetus from both teams as they sought to claim an invaluable three points. Chesterfield began to find their rhythm as they carved out chance after chance, but the Sky Blues' stubborn defense and goalkeeping thwarted their efforts. As the match entered its final stages, it appeared that the two sides would have to settle for a share of the spoils. However, Chesterfield talisman Dan Gardner had other ideas. With just minutes remaining, Gardner gathered possession in the Coventry City half and unleashed a ferocious strike from 30 yards out. The ball soared past the Coventry goalkeeper, nestling into the back of the net and sending the Chesterfield faithful into delirium. The match concluded with a 1-0 victory for the Spireites. Gardner's late winner could prove to be an incredibly important moment for Chesterfield's season, as they now sit three points closer to escaping the dreaded relegation zone. This vital win has given Chesterfield's players a much-needed confidence boost in their fight for League One survival. Despite the club's ongoing managerial search, the players displayed tremendous character and spirit throughout the match. Coventry City, on the other hand, will be bitterly disappointed with the outcome. The Sky Blues find themselves further embroiled in the relegation battle, with the pressure mounting on both the players and the coaching staff. Despite the rollercoaster of events during the season so far, Chesterfield's victory over Coventry City serves as a timely reminder that no team's fate is sealed in the world of football. As the League One season continues, both clubs will be desperate to continue fighting and defy the odds in one of the most competitive divisions in the English football pyramid. With performances like this one, Chesterfield may well prove that they have the ability to stave off relegation and build a brighter future for themselves in League One."},{"prompt":"Given the question: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden What might be the last step of the process?

SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Answer the following question: Q: What process is involved in the formation of a waterfall, when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock? A: OPT: I. calcification II. migration III. evaporation IV. erosion Answer:","completion":"A: The process involved in the formation of a waterfall when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock is erosion. When a river or stream flows over an area with layers of harder and softer rock, differential erosion occurs. Harder rocks are more resistant to erosion, while softer rocks erode relatively quickly. As the softer rock erodes, it creates a drop in elevation between the two types of rock, leading to the formation of a waterfall. The process of erosion primarily takes place through the actions of water, which gradually wears away the softer rock. Over time, the waterfall continues to retreat upstream, creating a gorge as the waterfall migrates. Waterfalls also erode due to the force of the falling water creating a plunge pool at the base, which can cause further erosion of the softer rock and deepening of the gorge. In summary, the formation of a waterfall when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock involves erosion. The other processes listed (calcification, migration, and evaporation) are not directly related to waterfall formation in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

He passed the car when it was safe. He put the car back on cruise control. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The car did the driving","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, the statement \\"The car did the driving\\" cannot be entirely true without considering some caveats and assumptions. Cruise control is an automatic feature in many modern vehicles that allows drivers to maintain a consistent speed without having to manually control the accelerator. When the man in the story puts the car on cruise control, this means that the car will be maintaining a specific speed set by the driver. However, the driver remains in control of other aspects of driving, such as steering, braking, and sometimes even speed adjustments depending on the situation. In the given paragraph, the man takes the car off of cruise control because the car in front of him is going too slow. This implies that the driver is still responsible for making decisions and actively driving the vehicle by controlling the speed and direction. He passed the slower car when it was safe to do so, and then reengaged the cruise control feature, allowing the car to maintain the desired speed automatically. While it is true that the car's cruise control feature handles a specific aspect of driving (maintaining a consistent speed), it is important to understand that cruise control does not equate to complete autonomy of driving. The driver remains in control of the majority of the vehicle's actions, including steering, braking, and lane changes. In this case, the driver made a decision to execute a pass, disengage the cruise control, and reengage it later. To fully conclude that the car did the driving, we would have to assume that the car was equipped with advanced self-driving technology or autonomous features that handle all aspects of driving. However, from the given paragraph, it does not state that the car has these advanced features, and it describes a situation where the driver is still actively involved in the driving process. So, although it is true that the car's cruise control feature contributed to the driving, the statement \\"The car did the driving\\" cannot be considered entirely true in this context without further information regarding the vehicle's advanced features or level of autonomy. The driver maintains primary responsibility for controlling the vehicle and making decisions in the given scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It can hybridize with Lelwel hartebeest to make the Kenya Highland hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel x cokii ) . - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae. - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water. - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\". - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. It is famous for having the Nairobi National Park, the world's only game reserve found within a major city. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County, whose current governor is Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor is Jonathan Mueke.

It could've been a lot worse. At least I can take a hit, right?' Campbell told her network that the crash may have been captured on film, but was not the first incident that day. '[Lane] has almost collided with me several times since I've been out here,' said, explaining that earlier in the day the high school football star narrowly missed her when he came out of the end zone. Too Late: Campbell (center), feeling Lane (right) behind her senses something is wrong and braces for impact. The moment of truth: Amy Campbell is knocked over as Ermon Lane collides in to her side after catching a football.

Article: Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them. Question: What do you think of the GM plant? - It grows too slowly. - It is bad for people's body. - It can greatly help the poor countries. - It produces less food than the general plant. Answer:","completion":"Based on the article, the most accurate answer appears to be \\"It can greatly help the poor countries.\\" The article states that genetically modified (GM) plants can produce more food, which could be of immense help to poor countries that are struggling with food production. GM plants are modified to resist plant diseases and thus potentially yield more crops. However, the article also raises concerns about potentially negative, yet unknown, health effects of GM foods, given they are not natural. It mentions that there are strong feelings against them being unnatural, and that they may cause harm to people or their future generations. Despite these concerns, both rich and poor countries appear to maintain a keen interest in using GM foods due to their advantages, especially in the context of a swelling global population. It's important to note that this summary doesn't assert that GM plants are bad for people's bodies, nor does it indicate that they grow slowly or produce less food than conventional plants. In fact, they are modified to grow more quickly and yield more food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Recycling used glass is the most environmentally friendly and beneficial option among the given choices. This is because recycling glass has multiple advantages, such as: 1. Energy Conservation: Recycling glass saves energy compared to the manufacturing of new glass from raw materials. This is because producing glass from recycled materials requires less heat than melting raw materials, such as sand, soda ash, and limestone. 2. Reduced Carbon Emissions: Producing glass from recycled materials generates fewer carbon emissions compared to manufacturing glass from raw materials. This is crucial in our fight against climate change and reducing our overall carbon footprint. 3. Resource Conservation: By recycling glass, we conserve natural resources, as less raw materials are required for production. This helps in preserving our resources for future generations. 4. Waste Diversion from Landfills: Recycling glass reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. This promotes waste management practices and helps alleviate the burden on our landfills. 5. Economic Benefits: Recycling glass creates jobs and promotes the recycling industry. By supporting the collection and processing of used glass, new opportunities are created in the workforce. When glass is recycled, it can be converted into various new products, including bottles, jars, insulation, glassphalt (used in road construction), and glass tiles. The recycled glass can also be used in different industries, such as construction, automotive, and even landscaping. In summary, recycling used glass is the best option among the given choices.

Sentence 2: The Astronomer turned his gaze to stare as well. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true, let's analyze both sentences step by step. Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 - \\"The Industrialist stared, looked at the Astronomer, turned to stare again.\\" - This sentence tells us that the Industrialist looked at the Astronomer and stared in a manner that suggests surprise or strong interest. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 - \\"The Astronomer turned his gaze to stare as well.\\" - This sentence suggests that the Astronomer also stared, which means he looked at something with a similarly intense gaze. Step 3: Evaluate the connection between the sentences - It is important to note that Sentence 2 does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship with Sentence 1. It simply states that the Astronomer also stared, but it doesn't specify what he stared at or why. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence can be true given the first sentence - Given that the first sentence is true, the second sentence can also be true, but not necessarily always be true. It is certainly possible that the Astronomer turned to stare as well, but it does not have to be dependent on the Industrialist's actions.

Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop.

Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. Desperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight.

Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears. Some time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life. Hearing footsteps, Joe flees from the police who have followed Laura, and Laura is arrested and jailed as an accomplice. A:","completion":"In the city of Sacramento, Joe becomes desperate for bus fare to return to San Diego in order to get his money from Patian. The circumstances leading to his desperation are a result of several events, including his involvement in a bank robbery as a getaway car driver, subsequent relocation to a boarding house in Sacramento, and the boarding house owner's claim that Patian is not reliable for paying Joe his share of the bank robbery money. As a consequence, Joe momentarily considers robbing a flower shop's cash register but ultimately decides against it after meeting and falling in love with the store clerk, Laura Benson."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},q={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
