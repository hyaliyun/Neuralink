Article: A mental professor walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the \\"half empty or half full\\" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired : \\"How heavy is this glass of water?\\" Different answers called out from the audience. She replied, \\"The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.\\" She continued, \\"The stress and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed--incapable of doing anything.\\" It's important to remember to let go of your stress.

The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Academy Award of Merit, which has become commonly known by its nickname \\"Oscar.\\" The awards, first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS. - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) is a professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures. The Academy's corporate management and general policies are overseen by a Board of Governors, which includes representatives from each of the craft branches. - Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, at times referred to as \\"The Master of Suspense\\". He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres. He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England's best director. Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955. - Burns and Allen was an American comedy duo consisting of George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen. They worked together as a successful comedy team that entertained vaudeville, film, radio, and television audiences for over forty years. - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - \\"Thanks for the Memory\\" (1938) is a popular song, with music composed by Ralph Rainger and lyrics by Leo Robin. It was introduced in the 1938 film \\"The Big Broadcast of 1938\\" by Shep Fields and His Orchestra with vocals by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross.

The film was well received by critics upon its release and garnered Academy Award nominations for Coburn and Krasna. - A character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \\"characters\\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Martha Raye (August 27, 1916 October 19, 1994) was an American comic actress and singer who performed in movies, and later on television.

The studios he was attached to included: Mutual, Triangle, Fox, Universal, Goldwyn, United Artists, Chadwick, and Paramount. - John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 April 26, 1865) was an American stage actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. Booth was a member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States. - The Primetime Emmy Award is an American award bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming.

The supporting cast features Edward Everett Horton , Ben Blue , Betty Grable , Jackie Coogan , John Payne , Robert Cummings , and Jerry Colonna . - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - The Television Academy Hall of Fame was founded by a former president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, John H.

The ship lands in a lake situated around the local fjords of ancient Norway during the time of the Vikings 709AD. From its wreckage emerge two bitter enemies: One) a soldier from another world that speaks Icelandic and states that he came from an Island to the North Kainan and two) a bloodthirsty creature known as the Moorwen. Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Soar High With Boeing And Friends Instead of experiencing a global collapse, welcome to a rejuvenated aerospace cycle fueled by resumed business air travel that accompanies resumed global growth. Even domestic carriers are seeing better flow. Yes, many still fret about a double-dip in the economy and a new depression, but this stems more from acerbic political filters than clear-sighted analysis. China didn't tighten, it just dialed back on the easing and its next slowdown is still several years off. There are certainly security and trade issues but its overriding interest is to sustain economic growth. The nation's largest exporter, Boeing, and its extended supplier chain will accelerate through the year. As with tech and semiconductors, the upturn didn't just begin this year, last quarter or even the preceding quarter. The bottom in commercial air travel was last spring and the recovery began late in the second quarter of 2009 with business jet use turning about the same time. The headlines and Wall Street research didn't catch onto this improvement until recently, indicating significant upside remaining in the civil aviation and industrial derivative aerospace stocks. With the downsizing specter removed on the military side, a host of aviation plays will benefit, resuming their strong ride off last year's market bottom. Follow Intelligent Investing On Twitter.

The latest import and export statistics demonstrate the mutual benefit of unfettered trade, borne out by just released U.S. trade statistics showing banner exports. And with no inflation, there's no need to materially tighten. The recent flurry of ISMs also pointed to strong incoming orders, low inventories and increased hiring intentions. Combined with strong corporate profits, the key indicators point positive. Reverting to moderate from massive monetary stimulus does not constitute tightening, so dispense with the rhetoric and focus on the numbers. The world needs new planes. Boeing ( BA - news - people ) and its multitudinous supplier base are on an upswing. Boom times might still be a year off but they've turned the corner and the stocks are correcting. Dogged fixation on global imbalances might kneejerk bad fiscal news from minor leaguers Greece, Spain and Portugal but it pales besides positives from collectively far more consequential France, Germany and Italy. Right on cue, a way oversold U.S. dollar has strengthened, sent riptides through investor portfolios over-weighted to weak dollar plays such as commodities and energy. Perhaps brooking argument, per se, raw materials have been overhyped, have attracted massive capital investment and aren't the same crux of this economic cycle as they were the last. Complex fixed-income instruments that got Wall Street into so much trouble will give way to equities as investors reset to the new reality. Today's upturn is all about the application of high technology to infrastructure, manifested both in mobile Internet and sophisticated industrial processes. World-class companies that can apply technologic innovation to real world needs are where the action is. First and foremost this means leading-edge engineering and applied science, whether IT, data networks, environmental safety, industrial automation, clean power or transportation. The latest civil aerospace and automobile products incorporate advanced electronics and materials knowhow.

When the fundamental climate turns back up, those are the go-to names to which all investors turn. The first sector out of the box last year, semiconductors, have largely retraced to the 200-day moving average, their technical correction coinciding with roaring fundamentals. Defense stocks ended their underperformance streak as Obama doubled-down in Afghanistan and the new defense budget restored weapons funding. China's cyber-attacks, missile procurements and space tests finally got Washington's attention. The latest Quadrennial Defense Review, an every four years public summation of our defense posture, points to robotics and electronics technology as security bulwarks. Civil aviation stocks, on the other hand, roared off their spring 2009 bottom and have yet to full retrace their 200 day and might still have some work ahead. The focus on underlying fundamentals, however, points to resumed upward track at some point. Improving corporate profits necessarily leads to increased air travel. Summary:","completion":"The aerospace industry, including companies like Boeing and its suppliers, is getting better because more people are traveling for business again. This helps airplane makers sell more planes and makes their stocks go up. There are also good things happening with companies that make computers, phones, and other technology that airplanes use.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Options are: i. yes. ii. no.","completion":"ii. no. The answer provided does not respond correctly to the question. The question asks for the name of the cemetery where Fryderyk Chopin, the Polish composer and pianist, was buried. The correct answer is that Chopin was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, France. Chopin's heart, however, was interred separately and at his own behest; it was enshrined within a pillar at the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, Poland. Chopin's burial at Père Lachaise Cemetery occurred after his death in 1849. The cemetery is one of the most famous cemeteries in the world, known for its notable occupants. It is a renowned tourist destination that attracts numerous visitors who come to pay their respects to the many famous people buried here, including writers, musicians, and philosophers. Regarding the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2, this is one of Chopin's most recognized works, often associated with funeral rites due to its solemn nature.

Sentence 2: Equal parts earth, fire, waster and air. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Let's analyze both sentences step by step. Step 1: Break down Sentence 1 \\"One part each, lending each its own essential quality to the mixture, so that the sky is solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air.\\" Sentence 1 can be interpreted as follows: 1. There is a mixture containing equal parts (one part each) of four elements. 2. The mixture has properties similar to those of earth, fire, water, and air. 3. These properties include being solid like earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, and insubstantial as air. Step 2: Break down Sentence 2 \\"Equal parts earth, fire, water, and air.\\" Sentence 2 can be interpreted as follows: 1. There is a mixture containing equal parts of the same four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. Step 3: Comparison We can now analyze whether Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 have similar meanings. 1. Both sentences mention a mixture containing equal parts of four elements. 2. Both sentences reference the four elements earth, fire, water, and air. The main difference: 1. Sentence 1 goes into detail about the properties of the mixture (solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air), while Sentence 2 only mentions the equal parts of the four elements.

A: Answer:","completion":"Ring-shaped hydrocarbons are called cyclic hydrocarbons. These molecules consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a closed loop or ring, forming a cyclic structure. Cyclic hydrocarbons can be further classified into two main categories based on the presence or absence of double bonds within the ring: 1. Alicyclic hydrocarbons: These molecules have only single bonds within the ring, similar to an open-chain, or aliphatic, hydrocarbon. They are also referred to as cycloalkanes. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the ring. Examples include cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). 2. Aromatic hydrocarbons: These molecules contain one or more double bonds within the ring, resulting in delocalized electrons and resonance structures. Aromatic hydrocarbons are typically more stable and display unique chemical properties compared to their non-aromatic counterparts. The most well-known aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6), which consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, forming a hexagonal ring with alternating single and double bonds.

Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D? John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Hint: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. The answer is:","completion":"Sample C would less likely be used as fuel compared to Sample D. The reason behind this conclusion lies in the composition and properties of both samples. Sample C consists of U-238, which is the most abundant isotope of uranium, making up approximately 99% of naturally occurring uranium. On the other hand, Sample D contains U-235, which constitutes about 1% of naturally occurring uranium. Uranium-235 is the isotope of interest when it comes to nuclear fuel, as it is fissionable and, therefore, can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. In contrast, U-238 is not readily fissionable, making it unsuitable for use as a fuel source. For uranium to be effective as nuclear fuel, the percentage of U-235 must be increased to at least 3%, which is achieved through a process called enrichment. Since Sample D is already U-235, it holds the potential for being enriched and used as fuel in a nuclear reactor with a higher efficiency. Sample C, on the other hand, will need to undergo separation from U-235, which is not only inefficient but also difficult, considering that chemical means of separation are unsuccessful due to the isotopes' identical chemistries. In summary, given the differences in fissionability and the need for enrichment, Sample C (U-238) would less likely be utilized as fuel when compared to Sample D (U-235)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"An Army drill instructor guiding his platoon in marching formation.\\", does this mean that \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"An Army drill instructor guiding his platoon in marching formation\\" does not imply that \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night.\\" These two statements are not directly correlated, as they describe two different scenarios and activities that a platoon might experience during their training. The first statement refers to a specific activity that takes place during military training, where a drill instructor is responsible for teaching and guiding their platoon members in various drills and exercises, including marching formations. The primary goal of these exercises is to instill discipline, coordination, and teamwork among the soldiers. Learning to march in a specific formation is essential for various parades, ceremonies, as well as providing efficiency, control, and flexibility when on the battlefield. The drill instructor plays a crucial role in ensuring the troops are well-prepared and maintain their discipline in all situations. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night,\\" describes the end-of-day routine for the soldiers, where they retire to their designated sleeping quarters to rest and recuperate. Most military units, including platoons, follow a strict schedule that provides time for various activities throughout the day, including physical training, classroom instruction, practical exercises, meals, personal hygiene, and rest. Properly structured sleep and rest periods are essential for maintaining the health, focus, and overall well-being of soldiers. While both statements are part of a soldier's overall training and daily routine, one does not imply the other, as they represent different phases of a typical day at a military training facility. The first statement is an example of an exercise that takes place during the active portion of their training, while the latter is an instance that happens during their rest and recovery period. By addressing both aspects, the military ensures that its soldiers receive the necessary training and development to excel in their duties, as well as the proper care and rest to support their physical and emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities. - Grisons ( see also other names) is the largest and easternmost canton of Switzerland. The canton shares borders with the cantons of Ticino, Uri, Glarus and St. Gallen and international borders with Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. The name Graubünden translates as the \\"Grey Leagues,\\" referring to the canton's origin in three local alliances, the League of God's House, the Grey League, and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions. Grisons is also home to three of Switzerland's ethnic groups and the subsequent languages of Swiss German, Italian and Romansh are all native to the state. It is the only officially trilingual canton and the only canton where the Romansh language has official status. - Piz Corvatsch is a mountain in the Bernina Range of the Alps, overlooking Lake Sils and Lake Silvaplana in the Engadin region of the canton of Graubünden. With an elevation of , it is the highest point on the range separating the main Inn valley from the Val Roseg. Aside from Piz Corvatsch, two other slightly lower summits make up the Corvatsch massif: Piz Murtèl (north of Piz Corvatsch) and the unnamed summit where lies the Corvatsch upper cable car station (north of Piz Murtèl). Politically, the summit of Piz Corvatsch is shared between the municipalities of Sils im Engadin and Samedan, although the 3,303 m high summit lies between the municipalities of Silvaplana and Samedan. The tripoint between the aforementioned municipalities is the summit of Piz Murtèl. - Lake Sils (German \\"Silsersee\\", Romansh: \\"Lej da Segl\\") is a lake in the Upper Engadine valley, Grisons, Switzerland. It takes its name from the village of Sils im Engadin. The lake lies at an altitude of 1,797 metres above sea level, between Maloja Pass and Lake Silvaplana.

In Syria, there are some people who call themselves the \\"Islamic State fighters.\\" They are a group of people who are not very nice and don't like to share things with others. They want to keep everything for themselves and make other people follow their rules. One day, some of the Islamic State fighters decided to play near the long fence that separates Turkey and Syria. They started to throw rocks and other things at the Turkish soldiers who were guarding the fence. Just like in school, when someone throws something at you, it might hurt you and make you sad. The Turkish soldiers didn't like it when the Islamic State fighters threw things at them. They wanted to keep their land safe and did not want these not-nice people to come in and take their toys. So, the soldiers threw things back at the Islamic State fighters to make them go away. This is what we call \\"exchanging fire.\\" During this big fight, one of the Turkish soldiers got very hurt and sadly, he died. The people in Turkey were very sad and worried about their soldiers who were trying to keep their land safe. The officials, who are like mommy and daddy figures of the country, told everyone about what had happened. This story shows us that sometimes, people fight over things and don't want to get along. It's important that we always try to be nice to each other, share our toys, and play together. Because when we fight, it can make us and the people around us very sad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the engineer think about Fergus?

Process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane. Question: suppose there are icebergs in the ocean happens, how will it affect wind speeds will develop more quickly. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less The presence of icebergs in the ocean can potentially affect the development of hurricanes and wind speeds by influencing the heat exchanges between the ocean surface and the atmosphere. To understand this effect, it is essential to consider the factors that contribute to the formation of hurricanes and the role played by ocean water temperature. Hurricanes typically form in warm ocean waters, particularly in the tropical regions where the water temperature is above 26.5°C (80°F). The warm water provides the necessary heat and moisture to fuel these storms. When the warm, moist air over the ocean surface rises, it creates an area of low pressure underneath it. This rising air then cools, condenses into clouds, and forms thunderstorms. As the thunderstorms come together around the center of low pressure, the Coriolis effect—caused by Earth's rotation—leads to the storm's rotation. The continuous supply of energy from the warm ocean water strengthens the storm, and when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is classified as a hurricane. Now, let's consider the impact of icebergs on this process. Icebergs are large masses of freshwater ice that have broken off from glaciers or ice shelves and are floating in open water. They are significantly colder than the surrounding ocean water, and their presence can lower the temperature around them due to the melting process, thereby cooling the nearby ocean water. This cooling effect could potentially slow down the development of hurricanes and reduce wind speeds. When the water temperature drops, there is less heat available for evaporation, which means less moisture is added to the atmosphere. With reduced heat and moisture, there would be less fuel to generate and sustain a hurricane. Moreover, cooler water temperatures might disrupt the formation of the initial thunderstorms necessary for a developing hurricane, making it harder for the storm to reach the 74 mph threshold. It is important to note that the presence of icebergs alone would not completely prevent the formation of hurricanes, as other factors like atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and ocean currents could still contribute to the development of a storm. However, their cooling effect on the surrounding ocean water can still make it less favorable for hurricanes to develop and could lead to lower wind speeds overall. In summary, the presence of icebergs in the ocean is likely to cause less favorable conditions for hurricane development and could lead to a reduction in wind speeds. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In fact, it has become a necessary and important part of the American way of life. In 1986, sixty-nine percent of American families owned at least one car, and thirty-eight percent had more than one. By giving workers rapid transportation, the automobile has freed them from having to live near their place of work. This has encouraged the growth of the cities, but has also led to traffic problems. For farm families the automobile is very helpful. It has made it possible for them to travel to town very often for business and for pleasure, and also to transport their children to distant schools. Family life has been affected in various ways. The car helps to keep families together when it is used for picnics, outings, and other shared experiences. However, when teenage children have the use of the car, their parents can't keep an eye on them. There is a great danger if the driver has been drinking alcohol or taking drugs, or is \\"showing off\\" by speeding or breaking other traffic laws. Mothers of victims of such accidents have formed an organization called MADD(Mothers Against Drunk Driving). These women want to prevent further tragedies . They have worked to encourage the government to limit the youngest drinking age. Students have formed a similar organization, SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving) and are spreading the same message among their friends. For many Americans the automobile is a necessity. But for some, it is also a mark of social position and for young people, a sign of becoming an adult. Altogether, cars mean very much to Americans.

Shopping in frozen foods, spicy foods or high-protein foods can make or break this training. Talk to your veterinarian before embarking on this exercise... The answer should be","completion":"1). You can use store-bought treats specifically made for chinchillas, or you can use household foods that are safe for chinchillas like raisins. Limit how many treats you give your chinchilla each day, as overfeeding can lead to health problems and reduce the effectiveness of the training. When offering treats to your chinchilla, it's crucial to consider their nutritional needs and avoid providing snacks that could be harmful to their delicate digestive systems. Chinchillas thrive on a diet composed of high-quality hay, supplemented with pellets specially formulated for them. Treats should only constitute a small portion of their diet. Once you have identified a suitable treat, it's time to create a conducive training environment. Choose a quiet, calm space where your chinchilla feels secure and can focus on the training without distractions. Keep in mind that these animals are nocturnal, so the best training time would be in the early evening when they are naturally more active and alert. Next, establish a clear and consistent signal, such as a clicker or a specific word, to communicate with your chinchilla during training. This signal, often referred to as a \\"marker,\\" should be used whenever your chinchilla performs the desired behavior. By using the marker alongside the treat reward, you'll help your chinchilla associate the sound with the desired action and positive reinforcement. Start by teaching your chinchilla simple behaviors, such as coming to you when called or climbing onto your hand. Be patient and progress slowly, as chinchillas have a natural skittishness that can make it difficult for them to trust new experiences. Remember to always provide praise and reinforcement when your chinchilla completes the desired task. Build gradually on these foundational behaviors, introducing more complex actions as your chinchilla becomes more comfortable and confident. Always maintain a positive and patient attitude, ensuring the training sessions are enjoyable and rewarding for both you and your pet. Finally, be aware that training a chinchilla will take time and commitment. These intelligent animals have distinct personalities and will learn at their own pace.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The chinchillas will need to time to get to know each other and bond before they mate. You will need to have small wire cages for each chinchilla ready. Make sure the cages are made of wire and are 18” high with very small mesh so the chinchillas cannot escape the cage. You should also have a larger cage available so you can place the two chinchillas together in the larger cage once they are comfortable around each other and ready to mate. The cage should be big enough for the two chinchillas to move around and mate. You may include bolt holes or cubby holes in the larger cage. This will give the male a space to hide of the female does attack him before mating. You should also set up a cage for the kits so they have housing once they are born. You should use a cage that is no higher than 18” and 1” x ½” or smaller. The kits will likely climb the sides of the cage so it should be small enough for them to drop from a short height. Make sure the mesh is small all the way around the cage so the kits cannot climb out of the cage or slide through the holes. You should set up the breeding cage in a quiet area that does not get a lot of traffic in your home, such as a spare room. Chinchillas are averse to loud noises, strong smells, and being surrounded by new people. You should create a quiet, isolated environment for your chins so they can breed successfully. Most chinchillas breed well in rooms that are kept at a cooler temperature, between 52 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Try to keep your chinchillas in a room below 75 degrees Fahrenheit at all times. You may place a fan in the room to circulate the air and play a radio on low in the room. The radio can help to block any outside noise or noise in your home.

These traditionally styled refrigerators tend to have fewer features, but they're usually cheaper than other options.","completion":"Consider a bottom-freezer refrigerator if convenience and organization are important to you. This style positions the freezer at the lower part of the unit, so the refrigerator compartment is at eye level. This can make it easier to find and access your fresh foods. Bottom-freezer models often come in various configurations, such as pull-out drawers or swing door designs, offering extra flexibility and storage options. Look into side-by-side refrigerators if you have a limited space and you want easy access to both refrigerator and freezer compartments. With a vertical split design, these models provide equally accessible compartments for fresh and frozen foods. These refrigerators often come with features such as in-door ice makers and water dispensers, which can save space in both freezer and refrigerator compartments. However, the side-by-side doors may be narrower, which can make it difficult to store larger or wider items. Evaluate French door refrigerators if you want a combination of style, convenience, and storage efficiency. This design typically features a large refrigerator compartment at the top, with two side-by-side doors, and a bottom freezer compartment. This design offers wide shelves for easier flexibility in storing larger items, and many models also come with additional drawers and compartments for better organization. Consider the available space in your kitchen to determine the appropriate size and dimensions of the refrigerator. Measure the width, height, and depth of the area where the refrigerator will be placed, and be sure to take note of door swings and any other obstructions that may affect the placement. In addition, consider how much space you'll need for your food storage habits, taking into account the size of your household and how frequently you shop for groceries. Think about the energy efficiency of the refrigerator, as this can have a significant impact on your electricity bill over time. Look for models with an ENERGY STAR rating, which indicates that they meet efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. Some models may also include energy-saving features such as adaptive defrost and temperature sensors. Pay attention to the internal and external features of the refrigerator. Internal features to consider may include adjustable shelving, spill-proof shelves, gallon door storage, humidity-controlled drawers, and specialized compartments for specific foods like produce and deli items. External features might include a water dispenser or ice maker, fingerprint-resistant finishes, and smart technology for remote monitoring and adjustment. Take into account the noise level of the refrigerator, especially if your kitchen is adjacent to a living or sleeping space. Many modern models are designed to operate quietly, but some can still make a noticeable hum. It's a good idea to read customer reviews before making your decision. Set a budget for your refrigerator purchase, factoring in not only the cost of the appliance but also any delivery, installation, and recycling fees. Make sure to account for the potential need for water line installation in case you choose a model with a water dispenser or ice maker. Shop around to compare prices, features, and customer reviews. Visit appliance stores and browse online to get an idea of what is available in your desired style and budget range. Keep an eye out for sales and promotions, as you may be able to find a high-quality refrigerator at a discounted price. In summary, choosing your refrigerator involves considering style, size, energy efficiency, features, noise, budget, and available space in your kitchen. By taking all these factors into account and comparing different models, you will be able to find the perfect refrigerator for your needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

Some girl with green hair and a pierced head was behind me chatting on her cell phone about flying out to Amsterdam to catch a P show at the end of the month. It took all I had not to turn around and strangle the life out of the waifish little nit. \\"--means Power. Fargo18 said it's a reference to Damon's first girlfriend, but he's full of shit.

In the few hours I've been with the dog, it never once threatened me. But its mindless stare made my skin crawl. And I was going to have to put the top up soon. This dog was far from predictable and the last thing I needed was him jumping out and running off with someone's kid. I would probably have to put the chain back on him. I threw the beef jerky at Cerberus' feet then spent the next fifteen minutes doctoring myself. I was going to have a nasty scar over my left eye to match the one on my right temple.

Movie title: Halloween II Movie plot: After being attacked by Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), who vanished after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony on October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that same night while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues to search for Michael. Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister. Now knowing Laurie is in danger and that he must get to her before Michael does, Loomis shoots at the window, demanding the Marshal quickly bring him to the hospital where she is. Just when Nurse Jill Franco (Tawny Moyer) locates Laurie in the hallway, she...

During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.

They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has defended his preparation for this week's British Open as he bids to win back-to-back majors without playing any competitive golf since his U.S. Open triumph at Congressional. The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland has drawn comparisons with Tiger Woods for the manner of his eight-shot triumph, but has not lifted a club in anger in the intervening three weeks. It has led his former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie to question the wisdom of the lack of match practice, but McIlroy was adamant Tuesday that his approach worked for him. \\"I mean, I've prepared the exact same way that I've prepared for the last few major championships, and I feel it's a process that works for me, \\" he told of the official British Open website. \\"Coming to the course the week before, getting a couple of practise rounds in, and then not really getting to the course until Tuesday afternoon. \\"That works for me. I used to do it to sort of keep under the radar. I'm not sure I'll be able to do that anymore. But it works for me. Caddying for the world number one. \\"It might not work for other people, but I feel as if it's the best way for me to approach a tournament. It seems to have worked the last few times, so I just need to keep doing that.\\" McIlroy has also had to cope with being catapulted into celebrity ranks, with a high-profile appearance at the Wimbledon tennis championships plus a host of other media commitments. He admitted the reaction to his first major success had been something of a surprise. \\"I didn't realize how much of a fuss it would create or how much of a buzz,\\" said McIlroy. \\"I've already sort of noticed over the past three weeks it has been a bit of a life-changing experience, and it's just something I'm going to have to deal with.\\" McIlroy tees off at Royal St George's in the 140th edition of golf's oldest major at 9.09 local time with Ernie Els of South African and fellow young gun Rickie Fowler of the United States. He will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year's British Open at St Andrews which gave him the first round lead, but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory. Meanwhile, world number one Luke Donald bids for back-to-back victories of his own after claiming the Scottish Open at Castle Stewart at the weekend. Donald, who took over the mantle from fellow Englishman Lee Westwood, admitted he was in the form of his life. \\"This is probably the best I have ever played,\\" he said as he reflected on a stellar 2011 which has seen him claim three victories and a clutch of top-10 finishes. It was kickstarted by his victory at the WGC World Match Play tournament in Arizona. \\"As soon as you get that one win, it kind of opened up the door, gave me a lot of confidence, and I've been playing very well since then,\\" he added.

Question 2: Visas (entry/exit permits): Can I travel to USA (Tourism B2 visa) from India using the B2 visa issued in UK (London US embassy)? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: If I have a B2 multiple visa and exit to The Bahamas and then return to the USA, will my length of visit be renewed to another 6 months? Answer 1: The B2 visa is a type of U.S. non-immigrant visa meant for tourism, visiting family/friends, or medical treatment. This visa generally has a validity of up to 10 years and allows multiple entries. However, the validity of the visa is not the same as the maximum duration of your stay. The maximum duration of your stay in the U.S. during a single visit depends on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who usually grants an authorized period of stay for up to 6 months. When you travel to a nearby country, such as The Bahamas, and return to the USA, the U.S. CBP officer will decide on the duration of your authorized stay by considering various factors. This includes the purpose of your trip, your previous visits, and ensuring compliance with the rules and conditions of your B2 visa. There is no guarantee that your length of stay will be automatically renewed to another 6 months. It is up to the CBP officer's discretion to decide the length of your new authorized stay. It is crucial to understand that frequent and extended stays in the U.S. may raise suspicion and lead to denial of entry. Therefore, it is always advisable to maintain a reasonable gap between visits in order to avoid any issues at the U.S port of entry. Question 2: Visas (entry/exit permits): Can I travel to the USA (Tourism B2 visa) from India using the B2 visa issued in the UK (London US embassy)? Answer 2: Yes, you can travel to the USA using a valid B2 visa issued by any U.S embassy or consulate, regardless of the country in which you applied for it. The B2 tourist visa, in this case issued by the London U.S. embassy, is a non-immigrant visa that allows entry to the United States for tourism or medical treatment purposes. The important requirement is that your B2 visa should still be valid at the time you travel. If you hold a valid B2 visa issued in the UK and are currently in India, you can use your visa to travel to the United States. However, note that entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and remains at the discretion of the U.S. CBP officer at the port of entry. They will consider factors such as the purpose of your visit, your travel history, and your overall immigration and entry risk profile. A valid B2 visa granted by a U.S. embassy or consulate allows you the opportunity to request entry to the United States but does not guarantee that entry will be permitted. Comparison of answers: The answers to the two questions are not the same, as both questions address different aspects of B2 visa usage and entry regulations. - Answer 1 focuses on the renewal of the authorized stay period upon reentry to the U.S. after a trip to a nearby country (The Bahamas) while holding a valid B2 visa with multiple entries. The answer emphasizes that the duration of the authorized stay will depend on the discretion of the CBP officer. - Answer 2 addresses the eligibility of traveling to the USA from India using a B2 visa issued in the UK. The answer confirms that it is possible to use a B2 visa issued in any country, as long as the visa is valid at the time of travel. The answer also emphasizes that the entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and depends on the CBP officer's judgment at the port of entry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To easily make a bubble wand, take a length of medium wire, and use a pair of pliers to bend it into a loop, or whatever shape you want, until it folds back on itself and the hoop is complete. Using a pair of pliers is the more sound option in terms of naive physics reasoning because pliers provide more control and precision when bending the wire. Pliers are designed to manipulate materials like wires, while fingers may not be strong enough or precise enough to get the desired shape. Additionally, using pliers can reduce the risk of injury from sharp wire ends.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.

It's considered to be the world's most sophisticated superfighter jet, but Britain's new £150million combat aircraft has been banned from flying in bad weather for fears it could explode. Engineers working on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have found the jet's fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning. According to reports, the aircraft, which is hoped to enter service for both the RAF and the Royal Navy in five years' time, has also been made more vulnerable to enemy attack than the aircraft it is set to replace, after its weight was reduced in an attempt to increase fuel efficiency. The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), has been banned from flying in bad weather, for fear its fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning. The Telegraph has reported the revelations were disclosed in a leaked report from the Pentagon's operational test and evaluation office, which states that, until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned, test-flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is 'not permitted'. Several other problems have been identified with the plane, including a fault in the design of the fuel tank which means it is unable to rapidly descend to low altitude. A handful of cracks were also discovered in the tested aircraft during examinations by the United States Air Force and the aircraft's manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The report states: 'All of these discoveries will require mitigation plans and may include redesigning parts and additional weight.' A Lockheed Martin spokesman has said the manufacturer does not consider the latest problem a 'major issue'. The spokesman said: 'We have. demonstrated very good vulnerability performance and we continue to work. with the Joint Programme Office.' The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph. The short take-off and vertical-landing version of the F-35B is due to become Britain's replacement for the Harrier. The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph and a range of 1,450 miles, compared to the Harrier's 700mph and range of 350 mile range.

And while the US is buying 2,500 F-35s for £254bn, Britain is committed to buying only 48, although the final decision will depend on the role of the Royal Navy's two new carriers in the future and whether the price of the aircraft falls, as is expected.

More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England.

Summarize this article: The drop never fell for physicist John Mainstone, but many of his colleagues and students may get to witness it later this year. Mainstone, the custodian of the world's longest-running science experiment, died in his sleep on Friday. He was 78. University of Queensland physicist Thomas Parnell began the experiment in 1927 by warming and pouring pitch—an extraordinarily viscous derivative of coal—into a funnel over a beaker. Parnell was trying to demonstrate that although pitch is so brittle that it'll shatter under a hammer blow, it is actually a liquid at room temperature and will flow and form drops. The only problem was that the drop formation is extremely slow, with eight and nine years passing between the first three drops. By the time Mainstone joined the University of Queensland faculty in 1961, Parnell's pitch drop demonstration had been relegated to some dusty cupboard. Mainstone convinced the physics department to bring it out and display it. Mainstone never personally got to see a drop fall, however. Neither did Parnell, nor anybody else in the world. Another pitch-drop experiment at Trinity College Dublin did create a drop this July that the college caught on camera. That demonstration began after the University of Queensland's, in 1944. Although it takes years to form a drop, it only takes a few seconds for one to fall, and the exact time of the fall is unpredictable. One of Mainstone's drops fell in 2000, but the cameras trained upon it malfunctioned. There's a live camera aimed at the experiment right now. The feed looks eerily like a still photo. Mainstone got an Ig Nobel in 2005 for \\"leading\\" the pitch drop experiment, but we're guessing the experiment didn't actually take up any of his time or taxpayer money or anything. (Except for those cameras.) The experiment is a curiosity and a bit of science décor for the University of Queensland. Mainstone researched the physics of the Earth's atmosphere, Australia's ABC News reports. Before his death, he suffered a stroke and was treated by two cardiologists who had once been his students. Earlier this year, he said he thought the next drop would fall before the year was out, PhysOrg reports. ||||| This undated photograph released on August 26, 2013 shows John Mainstone (3rd L) with students examining the world's longest running laboratory test, the Pitch Drop Experiment. Mainstone died last week after overseeing the experiment for over half a century. The science professor who oversaw the world's longest running laboratory test—the Pitch Drop Experiment—has died after more than half a century on its watch, his university said Monday. John Mainstone, the former head of the Department of Physics at the University of Queensland, was in charge of the experiment which demonstrated the fluidity and viscosity of pitch, a tar derivative once used to waterproof boats. The experiment, established in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell, was designed to show that pitch, although it feels solid and can be shattered by a hammer blow at room temperature, acts like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time. It took three years for the pitch to settle and then the glass funnel holding the substance was cut to allow it to flow out. In the 83 years since then, only eight drops of pitch have fallen and no one has seen one actually fall, the university said. Earlier this year Mainstone, who died last week aged 78 after suffering a stroke, said it looked like the next drop would fall before the end of 2013. \\"It's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop,\\" the professor, who had monitored the tar's glacial movements for 52 years, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The head of the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queensland University Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, said Mainstone would be greatly missed. \\"Professor Mainstone's dedication to the long-running experiment well past his official retirement ensured that media, researchers and undergraduate students had easy access to relevant information and an understanding of the important science behind it,\\" she said. \\"John's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment, he did not see a single drop fall,\\" she added. The experiment is under constant surveillance, with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop's fall on camera.

Write a title for this article: FBI Director James Comey's announcement Friday that the bureau would investigate more emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's private server sent a jolt through the political world, setting off alarm and anger among Democrats who worry the news could swing the election to Donald Trump. It remains unclear whether the emails are new or pertinent to the probe Comey had ended months ago. But the decision to go public with his renewed interest has enraged the Clinton campaign, which called Comey's letter to congressional leaders \\"long on innuendo and short on facts.\\" Clinton, at an event Saturday, in Florida questioned his timing, saying she found it \\"deeply troubling.\\" In July, Comey invited scorn from Republicans when he made public his office's initial decision not to recommend charges against Clinton. At a glance, the career prosecutor is an unlikely candidate to take centerstage in this weird and wild presidential campaign, but history shows Comey has never shied away from grand gestures and the headlines that follow. Comey, who was appointed to a 10-year term that will carry into the next administration, came into national prominence in 2007 when, during testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told the story of a tense standoff over a federal domestic surveillance program with top officials from the administration of President George W. Bush. (Comey had been tapped as a deputy US attorney general under Bush in 2003.) The incident took place in the evening of March 10, 2004, according to Comey's account, with then-Attorney General John Ashcroft ill and incapacitated in a hospital intensive care unit. Top White House lawyer Alberto Gonzales (who would later become U.S. attorney general) and Bush Chief of Staff Andrew Card had raced to Ashcroft's side in an effort to have him sign off on an extension to the wiretapping program, which Justice Department attorneys had deemed illegal. The weakened Ashcroft managed to make clear his refusal and Gonzales and Card left the room -- with Comey, then Ashcroft's top deputy, watching on -- without a word. When lifestyle guru Martha Stewart was indicted in 2003 on a series of charges connected to a dodgy 2000 stock deal, it was Comey who brought the charges. ''This criminal case is about lying -- lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, lying to investors,\\" Comey, then a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a press conference. ''Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but because of what she did.'' Stewart was convicted on all counts in 2004 and sentenced to five months in prison. She served her time and was released in March 2005. In fact, the email server probe marked the third time Comey has investigated Bill or Hillary Clinton. His first run-in came in the mid-1990s, when he joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. There he dug into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to a Arkansas real estate venture gone bust. No charges were ever brought against either Clinton, but the scandal would eventually lead to independent counsel Kenneth Starr's probe that would result in the Lewinsky scandal. In 2002, Comey, then a federal prosecutor, took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton's 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted on a laundry list of charges before fleeing the country. The decision set off a political firestorm focused on accusations that Rich's ex-wife Denise made donations to the Democratic Party, the Clinton Library and Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign as part of a plan to get Rich off the hook. Comey ultimately decided not to pursue the case. The kicker: Comey himself had overseen Rich's prosecution between 1987 and 1993. Comey's first brush with the law was a traumatizing one. In October 1977, he and his younger brother were held captive in their home by the so-called \\"Ramsey Rapist.\\" The armed man, who cops were hunting following a series of home invasions, had recently assaulted two babysitters in the area. , the Comey brothers were held at gunpoint and locked in a bathroom inside their family's Allendale, New Jersey, house. They escaped through a window but were confronted outside by the suspect before bolting back in and contacting police. Comey became the seventh FBI director when he was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2013, by a 93-1 count, with Sen. Rand Paul the lone holdout. The Kentucky Republican had threatened to block Comey's nomination, but relented and allowed a vote after being further briefed on FBI drone surveillance policy. Comey succeeded Robert Mueller III, who had held the job for the previous 12 years. In his testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, Comey insisted that his FBI is \\"resolutely apolitical.\\" Comey himself, however, does have a partisan past -- as a Republican. \\"I have been a registered Republican for most of my adult life,\\" he said before adding that he is \\"not registered any longer.\\" The 6-foot-8-inch Comey, a basketball player like President Barack Obama, is the tallest FBI director in the bureau's history. In a White House ceremony to announce his nomination, Obama winked at Comey's height, calling him \\"a man who stands very tall for justice and the rule of law.\\" Editor's note: This story, first published in July, has been updated after FBI Director James Comey announced a new review of emails possibly linked to Hillary Clinton's private server.

It was first published in 1981 and has since become a popular choice for women looking to find a wide range of content in one magazine. The publication covers various topics such as recipes, health tips, fiction, beauty, fashion, home, and family advice. With a strong focus on enhancing women's daily lives through helpful advice and engaging stories, Woman's World has a dedicated readership and a widespread presence in multiple industries.

It focuses mainly on topics related to high fashion, beauty, lifestyle, and culture. This magazine is recognized for its articles on famous personalities, luxurious brands, and high-profile events while providing readers with a detailed insight into the latest fashion trends and beauty tips.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A group of schoolboys were caught by police after they were pictured surfing on the back of a bus while wearing rollerskates. The five youngsters, all aged between 12 and 15, were stopped by officers after a shocked bystander took a picture of them hanging on to the back of the bus as it drove up a hill in Dudley, West Midlands. But instead of charging them after they admitted being carried or towed by a motor vehicle, officers thought of a more productive punishment - they made them clean up the local us depot. Dangerous: A group of five youngsters were spotted hitching a ride on the back of a bus on rollerskates. PC Reg Steele, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As this was a minor traffic offence it could have been dealt with in two ways, either through the courts where a fine could have been processed or a community resolution. 'We agreed with National Express West Midlands that a community resolution would be the best solution and would give the youngsters time to think about their reckless actions. As well as cleaning up the depot, the group will also have to clean National Express's fleet of West Midlands buses. Raj Mishra, National Express West Midlands Operations Manager said: 'We hope that by the youngsters working with us to clean our vehicles and spending time on site with us, it will help them understand the dangers of using vehicles to tow them along.' Police guidance suggests officers should use them only for low level offences in which no-one is hurt, or for anti-social behaviour. Punishment: The youngsters, who were filmed by a shocked passer by, were made to clean up a local bus depot and its buses by police. Earlier this year, a schoolboy nicknamed 'the Titch-hiker' was named and shamed by his parents and handed over to police after video footage emerged of him hitching a lift home on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry. Sonny Wilson, 12, was captured on film sitting on the back of the truck as it drove through Blackburn, Lancashire. His father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian both saw the footage on Facebook and called the police. Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind, who were filming him, a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Bla bla Gooodd\\" Answer:","completion":"To determine the star rating of this review, we'll need to analyze the text and sentiment of the message, understanding that \\"★\\" represents the lowest rating and \\"★★★★★\\" the highest. Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. First, read the review: \\"Bla bla Gooodd\\" 2. Identify any positive or negative sentiment within the review. In this case, the word \\"Gooodd\\" seems to be a positive sentiment, despite the multiple repetitions of the letters \\"o\\" and \\"d\\". The phrase \\"Bla bla\\" is more ambiguous, possibly indicating indifference or a neutral sentiment. 3. Assign a star rating based on the positivity or negativity of the sentiment. In this case, we'll mostly consider the positive sentiment in \\"Gooodd.\\" 4. Taking into account the positive sentiment in \\"Gooodd,\\" along with the neutral sentiment of \\"Bla bla,\\" it's reasonable to assume that the reviewer is not overly enthusiastic about the subject. Therefore, we can estimate a middle-ground rating, rather than the highest rating. Answer: ★★★ stars.

While at a first glance the two questions appear to be asking the same thing, there is a nuanced difference between the two that makes them not the same. \\"What's the longest song?\\" could refer to a written or composed song, not necessarily recorded or produced. This interpretation takes into consideration pieces of music that could have been written out as sheet music, in theory or composed on a computer, for instance, that extend for an extraordinary length based on their conceptual design. Meanwhile, \\"What is the longest recorded song?\\" specifically asks for the longest song that has been formally recorded and presumably, published or released in some manner. This question excludes theoretical pieces and includes only music that one could potentially listen to, given they have access to the recording. Thus, the difference between these two questions lies in the precision of their scope: While the first question is broader and can include non-recorded pieces, the second is limited to recorded songs only.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the best way to: how do you stop a shoe from stinking up?","completion":"Making sure your shoes do not stink can be achieved in a number of ways. Here are some steps we can follow: 1. Cleaning: The first course of action should be trying to clean the shoes. Sweaty or wet shoes can trap smells. Some shoes are safe to toss in the washing machine, which makes for an easy cleaning process. If the shoes cannot be washed, wipe them down with a damp cloth mixed with mild soap. Why this is necessary: it helps clear the dirt and sweat which are the primary cause of the smell. 2. Dry Shoes Properly: After you have washed your shoes, or after a sweaty day, it's important to let them dry out properly. Never put them away wet or even slightly damp. If you can, remove the insoles and let them dry separately. Why this is necessary: A wet environment is the perfect habitat for bacteria and mould, which can contribute to bad smells. 3. Use Baking Soda: Baking soda is a widely recognized deodorizer, and once your shoes are dry, you can sprinkle some inside each shoe and let it sit overnight. The next day, be sure to shake out or vacuum the remaining baking soda out of the shoes. Why this is necessary: Baking soda doesn't just mask odors; it actually absorbs them, making it a powerful tool for this task. 4. Utilizing Essential Oils: Essential oils such as tea tree, cedarwood and eucalyptus offer antimicrobial and antifungal properties along with a pleasant smell. A few drops on the insoles can help combat shoe odor. Why this is necessary: This step helps to combat bacteria that may be causing the odor and replace it with a pleasant smell. 5. Use of Dryer Sheets: If you have a particularly smelly pair of shoes, consider inserting a dryer sheet overnight to help eliminate the odor. Why this is necessary: The perfume and detergents in these sheets can neutralize odors, making this an easy and accessible solution for smelly shoes. 6. Maintenance: Wear socks whenever possible to absorb sweat and regularly rotate your shoes so no single pair takes all the punishment. Why this is necessary: This helps prevent the accumulation of bacteria due to sweat. Following these steps and understanding why they work will help you to stop a shoe from stinking up in the most efficient and effective manner."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Democrat closes with a flourish on the generic campaign ad tagline: \\"I approve this message, because I would like to see Sen.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to do the same. (Jason Kander) Politicians have long liked to hold guns in campaign spots. They really like to fire them. Now, a candidate has introduced a new caliber of gun ad. Democrat Jason Kander, who is challenging Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) for his seat, appears in an ad blindfolded and standing at a wooden table in a darkly lit warehouse. As he begins to speak, Kander starts piecing together a rifle. The metallic clank of each part falling into place accentuates his argument, and the beginning of the ad establishes his credentials as someone who knows how to use guns, and respects them, too. But despite his proclaiming of support for the Second Amendment, it's not an ad that's likely to make the National Rifle Association happy. \\"I also believe in background checks, so that terrorists can't get their hands on one of these,\\" Kander pivots. Second Amendment advocates argue that background checks would limit a constitutionally guaranteed right, while background-check advocates say it's a simple matter of keeping weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals. Recent efforts at passing background-check legislation haven't gone very far in Congress. But the American public apparently isn't as split as the legislature; The Post reported last fall that about 85 percent of gun owners support universal background checks for purchasers. Kander actually has a chance to take Blunt's seat; despite its GOP lean at the federal level, Missouri is ranked the 10th most likely to flip parties in The Fix's most recent Senate rankings, in part because Democrats consider Kander, a 35-year-old secretary of state and Afghanistan war veteran, a strong recruit. If his newest ad resonates with voters, Kander will be that much closer. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Democratic Senate candidate Jason Kander is using a new ad to demonstrate his support for the Second Amendment and to counter criticism from the National Rifle Association (NRA). The ad shows Kander, who is currently challenging Senator Roy Blunt for his seat in Missouri, assembling a rifle blindfolded. Kander voices his support for Second Amendment rights while also expressing his belief in background checks to prevent terrorists from acquiring firearms. The NRA had previously accused Kander of being someone who would vote against Second Amendment rights. Recent polls have shown that approximately 85% of gun owners support universal background checks for firearm purchasers."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Educators, she said, have complained that the current system amounts in many cases to “kangaroo courts,” in which the rights of the accused are given short shrift unless they can afford to hire legal representation to pursue complaints. “No student should be forced to sue their way to due process,” she said. The speech, delivered at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, was livestreamed on the department's Facebook page. DeVos gave a measure of credit to the Obama administration, saying it “helped elevate this issue in American public life — they listened to survivors, who have brought this issue out of the back rooms of student life offices and into the light of day.” The Obama administration's 2011 \\"Dear Colleague\\" Letter threatened to pull funding from schools that didn't take sexual assault and harassment seriously. But the 2014 guidance that resulted from Obama's efforts has applied an ambiguous and overly broad definition of sexual assault and harassment, DeVos said, leading to \\"intimidation and coercion of schools\\" and, in a few cases, strange results: In one case, she said, a school opened a Title IX investigation after a male student who couldn't remember the name of a female instructor filled in a form with the name \\"Sarah Jackson,\\" a lingerie and swimsuit model. “Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation,\\" DeVos said. \\"But if everything is harassment, nothing is.” In a statement, National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García said educators nationwide \\"are appalled that the Department of Education has decided to weaken protections for students who survive campus sexual assault or harassment. This decision offends our collective conscience and conflicts with the basic values of equality, safety, and respect that we teach our students every day.\\" Eskelsen García called the proposed change \\"another example of a Trump-DeVos agenda that scorns respect for survivors, including Secretary DeVos’s own recent meeting with radical anti-woman activists and the president’s own recorded sexual assault confession during the campaign.” Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, said DeVos' announcement suggested \\"that she would prefer to take America back to a time when it was more difficult for survivors of sexual assault to receive justice. For the LGBTQ community, which faces disproportionate levels of sexual assault and violence, this decision sends a strong signal that the U.S. Department of Education will not use its full power to protect them from harm.\\" Philadelphia attorneys Gina Maisto Smith and Leslie Gomez have said universities understand Title IX's high-level mandates but are getting tripped up on the mechanics. Schools lack the resources and the tools, including subpoena power — that can harm students on both sides of an investigation. The pair have proposed universities utilize a network of regional centers, formed through partnerships between schools and law enforcement, that \\"could be a significant resource for resolving reports of misconduct that violate both Title IX and state criminal law.\\" Maisto Smith and Gomez, former career prosecutors who spent decades advocating for survivors — and whose damning investigation in 2016 into sexual assault allegations at Baylor University led to the ouster of former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr as president — said both universities and law enforcement face challenges responding to sexual violence. \\"Unless we engage in meaningful cultural and process changes, these challenges will persist,\\" Smith said. Brett Sokolow, executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators, a professional association that helps schools ensure Title IX compliance, said DeVos' announcement doesn’t mean most universities won’t continue to address sexual violence on campus. \\"The response will occur mostly at the margins, Sokolow said. \\"There are 20% of colleges that weren't all that committed to Title IX to begin with, and this is going to give them the excuse to pull back. But for 80% of the colleges out there that aren't at the margins, this is a cultural shift that's already taken place, and they're smart enough to understand that a rollback of sub-regulatory guidance doesn't change the fundamentals of Title IX that have been in place for 45 years.\\" DeVos has made a priority of revamping Title IX guidance, saying last July that the department should more equally weigh the claims of assault victims and the due-process rights of the accused. But her department's efforts have also brought unwanted notoriety. In an interview last July, Candice Jackson, DeVos’ assistant secretary for civil rights, said 90% of campus sexual assault claims “fall into the category of, 'We were both drunk, we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.'\\" Jackson later apologized for the remark, calling it \\"flippant.\\" Last June, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights voted to open a two-year investigation of the Trump administration's civil rights enforcement, particularly related to the education department under DeVos. The commission's chair is Catherine Lhamon, who oversaw civil rights under Obama's education department. Follow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo; Follow Alia E.

Don't just sit and watch. Speak up. Any rollback of Title IX protections will hurt your classmates, your students, your friends, your sisters.\\" The 2011 Obama guidance for the first time pushed school district, college and university leaders to combat sexual harassment, including sexual violence, saying the institutions were required to do so under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination. Women's groups hailed that as a crucial step in cracking down on sexual violence on campuses. But critics said it trampled the rights of the accused. The Trump administration will revamp the guidance through a rulemaking process that likely will take months, DeVos said, blasting the guidance for having \\"weaponized the Office of Civil Rights to work against schools and against students.\\" She said the administration will give all sides a chance to offer opinions on how it should move forward. \\"We will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective and fair system,\\" DeVos said. \\"This is not about letting institutions off the hook. They still have important work to do.\\" Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. DeVos said after the speech that she intends to revoke the Obama guidance.\\"The process is an extended one,\\" she told CBS News. \\"But it is the intention to revoke or rescind the previous guidance around this.\\" The Education Department will issue temporary Title IX guidelines for school districts, colleges and universities as it works on a permanent replacement for Obama-era guidelines, said agency spokeswoman Liz Hill. The far-reaching 2011 Obama-era guidance, issued in the form of a Dear Colleague Letter, was controversial from the start. It threatened a loss of funding to schools that failed to do enough to make students safe from sexual harassment, assault and rape. Critics said it pushed colleges to trample the rights of the accused. Among other things, the guidance pushed a lower standard of proof in campus disciplinary hearings than is used in criminal trials. Many of those critics hailed DeVos' announcement as \\"a really positive development.\\" “I think it was a strong signal from the department that the current approach is unworkable and needs to be changed,” said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil rights group that brought a court challenge to the 2011 guidance. Chris Perry, deputy executive director of the group, Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, which represents people accused of sexual assault, said DeVos' remarks show “the secretary is listening to folks.\\" The decision to launch a notice-and-comment process was long expected. DeVos said in July — after a series of meetings with sexual assault survivors, students accused of assault and college officials — that she would overhaul the policy. She told reporters at the time that “it’s clear that there are failings in this process. A system without due process protections ultimately serves no one in the end.” Advocacy groups — including those representing both sexual assault survivors and students accused of assault — were not invited to attend Thursday's announcement in person, despite meeting with DeVos on the subject in July. Instead, DeVos delivered the announcement during a tightly controlled half-hour event at the university's Arlington, Va., campus, sponsored by the university law school chapter of the Federalist Society, a conservative group. Shouts from protesters outside could be heard as she spoke. Advocates for survivors of sexual assault said they felt they were given short shrift and noted that research has shown false claims of rape are rare. They said DeVos had indicated she would hold similar listening sessions in other parts of the country before making a decision. Giving them just one meeting with the secretary \\"feels a little bit like paying lip service to the importance of having survivors in the room,\\" said Jess Davidson, managing director of End Rape on Campus. \\"I think there’s been a really concerning false equivalence of the concerns of survivors and the accused throughout this entire process with the Department of Education,\\" Davidson said. Sexual assault survivors rallied outside the university ahead of the announcement, urging DeVos to keep what they see as crucial protections in place. \\"It's really telling us that we don't matter, that our pain is not relevant to people in power,\\" said Chessy Prout, 18, who said she was assaulted as a high school freshman and subsequently had to change schools. Advocates slammed the speech afterward. “Don’t be duped by today’s announcement,\\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. \\"What seems procedural is a blunt attack on survivors of sexual assault. It will discourage schools from taking steps to comply with the law — just at the moment when they are finally working to get it right. And it sends a frightening message to all students: Your government does not have your back if your rights are violated. This misguided approach signals a green light to sweep sexual assault further under the rug.” Complicating the issue for DeVos are comments made by her civil rights chief, Candice Jackson, who told The New York Times this summer that 90 percent of sexual assault claims stem from drunken and regretted sex. Another complication is President Donald Trump's boast about groping women in the infamous \\"Access Hollywood\\" tape. “Secretary DeVos decided today to continue a pattern of undermining survivors’ rights, once again showing a clear lack of understanding or empathy for the millions of students who have experienced sexual violence on campus,\\" Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement. But her announcement drew praise from at least one Republican lawmaker. \\"The Department of Education is taking a positive first step in soliciting comments from stakeholders to get a better understanding of ways to better address the problem,” Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said. \\"However, this is an issue where Congress must give the Department of Education clear statutory authority to properly regulate.\\" Despite the administration's plan to rewrite rules on Title IX, it's unlikely that schools will immediately change policies that they spent the last six years writing — and sometimes rewriting — to remain in compliance with federal law. \\"No school is going to go back to doing what they were doing before the 2011 guidance,\\" said Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education.

She enrolls Ikuko in a nearby kindergarten and in order to win custody of her daughter, starts working as a proofreader, a job she held before she was married. The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl who is of similar age to her daughter. Yoshimi discovers that the upstairs apartment, the source of the leak, was formerly the home of a girl named Mitsuko Kawai (æ²³å ç¾æ´¥å­ Kawai Mitsuko; Mirei Oguchi), who was Ikuko's age. She had attended the same kindergarten Ikuko now attends. Mitsuko was abandoned by her mother and vanished more than a year ago. One day, Ikuko goes missing and Yoshimi finds her in the apartment upstairs, where the walls are running with water and the entire place is flooded. Convinced something eerie is happening, she decides to move but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position greatly in her divorce. One evening, after Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared in Ikuko's school bag, she heads to the roof of the building, and is drawn to the huge water tank. She notices that it was last inspected â and thus opened â over a year ago, on the day Mitsuko was last reported seen. She comes to the horrific realization via a vision that Mitsuko had fallen into the tank while trying to retrieve her red bag, and was thus drowned.

Step 2: Assessing the options Given that the two options presented involve committing some form of crime (theft or physical assault), we need to establish if there is an alternative option to these choices to evaluate the hypothesis. Step 3: Alternative option In order to conclude that the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes\\" is true, we need to prove that there is a possibility for the person in the premise to choose not to commit a crime. This alternative option can be expressed as \\"you choose not to steal or bash someone over the head, and instead, decide to not commit a crime.\\" Step 4: Evaluating the hypothesis Based on the alternative option, we can now evaluate the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes.\\" By choosing not to steal or physically assault someone, the person in the premise would indeed not commit crimes, making the hypothesis true under these conditions. Conclusion: Since an alternative option of not committing a crime exists, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes\\" can be true based on the given premise.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: No oil in the bottle. Product review: Oil was saturated on the directions... the lid was ovbiously not on tightly, thus having no oil in the bottle. The answer is:","completion":"The given product review would significantly decrease the chances of opting to purchase that product. The reasons for this are multi-fold and fundamental to customer satisfaction. Firstly, the title of the review already points to an issue with the product – “No oil in the bottle.” This indicates there was a significant leakage or spillage, resulting in the absence of the product you would be paying for. Purchasing this product means running the risk of experiencing the same mishap, putting into question the quality of the packaging and the attention to detail the manufacturer puts into securing the product for transit. The reviewer also notes that the oil was saturated on the directions, suggesting there was enough leakage to affect other parts of the packaging. As consumers, we expect and deserve products that are useable upon receipt. If oil has soaked the directions, it not only raises cleanliness concerns but also it may render the instructions for product usage unreadable. This could impact the effective, safe, and intended use of the product. Lastly, the reviewer points out that the lid on the product was obviously not on tightly. This implies a packaging flaw, which speaks volumes to the manufacturer's quality control practices. A loose lid could indicate inconsistent packaging methods or disregard for ensuring the product is well-sealed before it leaves the manufacturer. This oversight could lead to mishaps like the described oil leakage. Overall, this review paints the image of a product that has poor packaging, which could lead to more severe content leakages or other product compromises in the future. Crucially, it also raises questions about the manufacturer's quality control measures. All these factors serve to lower trust and confidence in the product and thus decrease the chances of buying it. However, it would be beneficial to look at other reviews of the product too. If the majority of reviews do not indicate similar issues, this incident could be an isolated case. Nonetheless, this particular review, when viewed in isolation, would decrease customer inclination toward purchasing the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These hydraulic systems provide reliable and efficient power transmission for tasks requiring precise manipulation and heavy lifting. The foundation of these hydraulic systems lies in the fundamental principle of fluid mechanics, where the pressure exerted on a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. Hydraulic fluid power motors are at the core of these systems and function as actuators converting fluid pressure into rotational mechanical energy. By doing so, these motors allow machinery to perform diverse tasks, including lifting, pushing, and rotating, with high precision and force. Since the defined category of hydraulic systems excludes those for civil aircraft of subheading 8412.29.10, it does not encompass the ones specifically designed for use in the aviation industry. Civil aircraft hydraulic systems play a critical role in controlling various aspects of an aircraft's operation, such as landing gear retraction, steering, and braking. By isolating this category, we primarily focus on hydraulic systems used in other industries and applications. Similarly, hydraulic power engines and motors, linear acting, are also excluded from this category. Linear-acting hydraulic systems, also known as hydraulic cylinders, provide linear or straight-line movement by converting fluid power into mechanical power. These linear systems are commonly used in a vast array of applications, such as construction equipment, manufacturing machinery, and automotive components. As contrasted with rotary actuators like fluid power motors, linear-acting hydraulic systems grant a range of movement in a straight path. Applications for hydraulic systems powered using hydraulic fluid power motors are quite diverse, spanning industries like agriculture, construction, material handling, marine, mining, and transportation. Some specific examples may include operating heavy machinery like excavators or bulldozers, controlling steering systems in ships, operating cranes and hoists, and powering various types of presses. The advantages of using hydraulic systems powered by hydraulic fluid power motors are multifold. Firstly, they offer a high power-to-weight ratio, enabling compact and lightweight designs without sacrificing power. They also deliver constant torque over a wide range of speed and load conditions. Additionally, hydraulic systems are straightforward to control, and feedback mechanisms can be easily integrated, ensuring precision and smooth operation in various applications. However, hydraulic systems are not without their drawbacks. They are prone to leaks, require regular maintenance, and can create environmental concerns due to the use of hydraulic fluids. Ongoing innovations and improvements in the design and materials of hydraulic systems are necessary to address these issues and continue to enhance their efficiency, reliability, and sustainability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Use evidence from the fact that the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River flowing over long periods of time to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River doing what over long periods of time?\\" Choices: (i) blazing. (ii) melting. (iii) moving steadily. (iv) evaporating.","completion":"The Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River doing option (iii) moving steadily over long periods of time. The evidence supporting this statement is based on several factors, including the geological formation of the region, the study of the sedimentary layers, the analysis of the erosional processes, and the course of the river itself. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Geological formation: The formation of the Grand Canyon is a result of millions of years of geological processes. The area was once covered by ancient seas, which deposited layers of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. Over time, these layers were uplifted and exposed due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. This set the stage for the Colorado River to flow through the area and begin the process of erosion and the eventual carving of the canyon. 2. Sedimentary layers: The Grand Canyon's rock layers reveal a history of deposition and erosion spanning millions of years. The layers are evidence that the Colorado River slowly and steadily eroded the rock over long periods of time. The different colors and compositions of these layers indicate that they were deposited during different geological time periods and under differing conditions. For example, the Bright Angel Formation (limestone) and the Tapeats Sandstone indicate that these were formed under the oceans, while the Coconino Sandstone, consisting of aeolian deposits, show the presence of ancient deserts. 3. Erosional processes: The Colorado River is responsible for eroding these sedimentary layers, gradually cutting downwards through the layers to create the Grand Canyon we see today. This process was aided by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, which increased the river's gradient, resulting in more forceful erosion. The river's flow is characterized by a steady movement, occasionally interrupted by seasonal floods, which cause significant erosion during high-intensity flow events. 4. Course of the river: The formation of the Grand Canyon isn't only determined by the vertical erosion but also by the meandering pattern of the Colorado River. As the river flowed, it twisted and turned, cutting deeper into the plateau. The complex network of tributaries connects to the main course of the river, further reinforcing the idea that the continuous and steady flow was the main driver for the canyon's formation. In conclusion, the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River steadily moving over a long period of time (option iii) as supported by geological, sedimentary, erosional, and river course evidence. This slow yet relentless process of erosion by the Colorado River, combined with the regional uplift, created the majestic and awe-inspiring landscape we now know as the Grand Canyon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For a moment, Paul wasn't even sure who had walked into the room. Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good. But Paul knew that this was a crucial moment. Chloe didn't really know the law - just a few points that her friend had helped her out with. She couldn't let the real lawyer take over the meeting. Her dramatic, unexpected entrance had them off guard, and Paul hoped she seized the moment and pressed on. Question: Who is Greg Driscol? === The answer to the above question is OPT: A).

William asked Hunter to drop the charges against his client because","completion":"William believed that the evidence against his client was weak, and he felt that pursuing the charges would result in an unjust conviction, potentially causing harm to his client's reputation, social standing, and future prospects. Additionally, William had uncovered new information that pointed towards either misconduct during the investigation, or procedural errors made by law enforcement. Moreover, William argued that the alleged victim's testimony was inconsistent and uncorroborated, making the chances of securing a conviction slim. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of protecting the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he saw the danger of allowing charges to proceed to trial when the foundation of the case was so tenuous. Furthermore, the witnesses called forth by the prosecution seemed unreliable, either through their criminal backgrounds or unanswered questions about their credibility. Upon analyzing the overarching facts and circumstances, William sensed that the charges against his client were based on ulterior motives or personal vendettas that could have clouded the judgment of those involved. He contended that, if allowed to proceed, the case would be a prime example of weaponizing the criminal justice system for personal gain, undermining the very principles of justice and fairness the system set out to protect. Additionally, William highlighted the potential waste of resources in pursuing such a case, given the limited budget allocated to public prosecutions. He stressed that the resources would be better spent focusing on cases with stronger evidence and clearer prospects for justice. Hunter, as the prosecutor responsible for pursuing charges, should consider the impact of their decision not just on this case, but on the broader public interest and community safety. By dropping the charges against his client, William argued that Hunter would uphold the integrity of the legal system and avoid devoting valuable time, money, and effort to a case built on shaky ground. This would instead allow for a thorough reevaluation of the available evidence and provide an opportunity for law enforcement to investigate alternative leads that may yield stronger suspects and a more just course of action. In conclusion, William asked Hunter to drop the charges against his client based on the following reasons: the weak evidence, inconsistencies in testimonies, potential misuse of the criminal justice system, the need to preserve the presumption of innocence, the importance of resource allocation, and the overall need to maintain the integrity of the legal process. By doing so, he believed that justice would be better served and that the public's trust in the system could be maintained."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But on the streets of Cairo, things are anything but normal. Thousands of protesters jamming the downtown area for the 16th day in a row. These people are mad at the government and they want Mubarak out of office now. The Egyptian vice president met with some of these protesters and promised that things will change. But there are concerns -- and not just from Egyptians -- that those changes aren't happening quickly enough. Here's CNN's Barbara Starr.

In a phone call, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden telling Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman there must be a transition with \\"immediate, irreversible progress.\\" ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy, about not seeing a lift of the emergency law. And I don't, I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress. STARR: But a calmer approach from the Pentagon, where sources say they are easing back from crisis atmosphere. ROBERT GATES, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: I think the Egyptian military has conducted itself in exemplary fashion during this entire episode. And they have acted with great restraint. STARR: Middle East analyst Michelle Dunne says the U.S. government message has changed from immediate action to a more protracted process. A process that is unclear. MICHELE DUNNE, MIDDLE EAST EXPERT, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT: President Obama has been calling for a transition to begin now. On the other hand, we hear Secretary Clinton a couple of days ago saying we support the process laid about by Vice President Suleiman, which is not a process the opposition has agreed to at all. STARR: There is a growing concern the man the U.S. is supporting, the new Egyptian vice president, is not on the same page. DUNNE: Up until now, the Obama administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition, that the Egyptian government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner, so to speak, in this transition. What Suleiman is offering right now is not that at all. (END VIDEO) More Winter Weather. AZUZ: Weather report is starting to sound like a broken record, and that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. Yes, there is yet another round of winter storms moving across the country. This is what Oklahoma City looked like on Tuesday, parts of the city getting up to 12 inches of snow. And this is just one week after that massive winter storm we reported on hammered the region. There are winter weather alerts from Texas all the way to the East Coast, with forecasts for rain, wind, snow and sleet through the rest of the week. Sound Check. BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in the past few months, although the unemployment rate remains high. State of the Economy. AZUZ: Well, you've heard of the president's State of the Union speech. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a kind of \\"state of the economy\\" address to Congress. And as you heard, he didn't really offer a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. It was kinda like a \\"thumbs sideways.\\" Talking to the House Budget Committee, Chairman Bernanke said Congress needs to make big changes to help stabilize the economy. The Federal Reserve has taken its own steps to try to get things going in the right direction. But some members of Congress, including the chairman of the budget committee, disagree with the Fed's actions. And they let Bernanke know how they felt during yesterday's hearing. Shoutout. TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Pendergast's class at Washington Middle School in Yakima, Washington!

You've got three seconds -- GO! Silicon Valley is where you'll find a center of U.S. information technology. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Silicon Valley's Projected Growth. AZUZ: The name comes from silicon being a main component in computer circuits. You heard Chairman Ben Bernanke a moment ago mention the economic recovery. There are signs of that in Silicon Valley, and it has to do with web sites that a lot of us visit every day. Dan Simon looks at some of the businesses that are on the rise in the valley. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebook is getting a new home address, the company announcing that it's taking over nearly eighty acres of property here in Menlo Park, California. It's taking over the former campus, which was held by Sun Microsystems. Facebook also announcing that it's going to be adding about a thousand workers over the next twelve months. And industry observers say it's sort of a barometer of what you're seeing here in Silicon Valley. Google announcing just last week it's adding six thousand people to its workforce. And what you're seeing is basically three sectors where the hirings are taking place. When it comes to social networking, of course led by Facebook and Twitter, mobile computing. We're talking about smart phones and all the applications that go on those smart phones, a lot of expansion there. And when you talk about cloud computing, any information or data that you get on your phone or PC that comes from the cloud. I had a chance to talk to Michael Copeland. He's a senior writer for Fortune Magazine. He says this is one of the most exciting periods he's ever seen here at Silicon Valley. MICHAEL COPELAND, SENIOR WRITER, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: I think it is on fire if you're in the right part of the industry. So clearly, social networking like Facebook, Google, the internet cloud, mobile. Those things are all going like gangbusters. If you're a mobile app developer in Silicon Valley, you can pretty much write your own ticket. SIMON: Economic figures released from the state of California show that Silicon Valley added a little more than eight thousand jobs in 2010. That trend expected to continue into 2011. But the question is is what broader impact will that have, not only here in California, but across the rest of the United States. Dan Simon, CNN, Menlo Park, California. (END VIDEO) Proposed Law on Sexting. AZUZ: The state of Texas is considering a new law focused specifically on the issue of \\"sexting.\\" The Texas attorney general says the goal of this proposed law is to educate instead of criminalize. Right now, sexting can lead to some very serious consequences. Sandra Endo explains how and why the state is thinking about making this change. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: When being social turns into sexting, that's when many teens could run into problems. A new proposed law in Texas is aimed at addressing teen sexting, punishing teens who send the texts and their parents. GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: They are exposing themselves 'round the world forever more. ENDO: A new survey shows one in five teens admitted sending or posting suggestive images of themselves. Nearly four in ten teens admitted sending sexually suggestive messages. The proposed law would charge the teen with a misdemeanor, forcing a court appearance, and require parents to enroll in an educational program. Eventually, offenders could wipe the slate clean at 17 years old. ABBOTT: Our goal is not to put more teens behind bars, but to try to prevent this type of conduct from taking place. ENDO: Right now, teens can be charged with possessing or trafficking in child pornography, an offense which carries the potential of decades of prison time and being on the registered sex offender list for life. Still, the new proposed law is aimed at helping teens think twice before they click and hit send. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People don't really care. Teenagers don't really care. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't think about it at all. They're not thinking when they do it. It's terrible. ENDO: In Washington, Sandra Endo for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Before We Go. AZUZ: All right, we need to set the scene for you for today's Before We Go segment: high school basketball game, third quarter's winding down. And that's when he grabs a rebound, one of the players just lets it fly. It made it! All the way across the court. This wasn't half court; this was full court. I don't think he was even trying to score. The buzzer beater still counted. And those three points, actually the winning margin in the game. This YouTube video of the last-second shot is getting a lot of hits. Goodbye. AZUZ: Which means the shot is generating a lot of buzz-er. We'll try to rebound from that pun tomorrow. And we hope you'll give us a shot. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"On February 10th, 2011, CNN Student News covered various events and topics, including the ongoing crisis in Egypt, updates on the economy in Silicon Valley, and a proposed law on sexting in Texas. Protests in Egypt continued as thousands of people demanded Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down from office. Egyptian officials promised change, but there were concerns about the pace at which changes were happening. The U.S. called for more urgency and pressured the Egyptian government for a faster transition towards democracy. Positive economic signs were seen in Silicon Valley, with key companies such as Facebook and Google planning significant expansion, adding thousands of jobs over the next year. Companies in social networking, mobile computing, and cloud computing were leading the growth in the tech industry. In Texas, a proposed law on sexting aimed to educate rather than criminalize. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and lawmakers proposed punishing both teenagers who send explicit texts and their parents, hoping this would deter conduct leading to legal consequences. The proposed law would charge teens with misdemeanors and require them and their parents to enroll in educational programs.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. The state borders South Carolina and Georgia to the south, Tennessee to the west, Virginia to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

The most populous municipality is Charlotte, and it is the second largest banking center in the United States after New York City. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - A Death in the Family is an autobiographical novel by author James Agee , set in Knoxville , Tennessee .

The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States.

Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author's life. While the events of the author's life are recounted, there is no pretense of exact truth. Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes. - Tanasi (also spelled Tanase, Tenasi, Tenassee, Tunissee, Tennessee, and other such variations) was an historic Overhill Cherokee village site in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States.

The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period.

The big increase in visitors from North America, from 483,000 in June of last year to 650,000 this year, was \\"clearly buoyed by the particularly sharp drop of the pound against the dollar since mid-2016\\", according to Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The number of visitors from Europe rose by 2% to 2.241 million. The weaker value of the pound since the Brexit referendum vote means that the UK is now a much cheaper destination than it used to be. Many mainland Europeans, Americans and Chinese people are taking advantage of that. That's clear from the cacophony of different languages and accents outside Buckingham Palace, and on the streets around the Palace of Westminster. \\"It's a little more economical than it was a few years ago,\\" says one visiting American tourist. Meanwhile, a German man said the euro-pound rate has \\"made me quite happy\\". UK tourism sector booms as sterling falls The best month so far this year was April, with 3.7 million visitors coming to the UK - up 19% from a year earlier. Over the April-to-June quarter the number of visitors from overseas rose to 10.75 million, up 8% from the same period a year earlier. But while holiday visits were up by 20% to 4.7 million over the same three months, business visits were down by 4% at 2.4 million. VisitBritain director Patricia Yates said: \\"Tourism is one of Britain's most valuable export industries and this continued growth demonstrates the industry's increasing importance as a key driver of economic growth across our nations and regions.\\" Summary:","completion":"The weak pound has attracted a record number of North American tourists to the UK, with visits rising 34% to 650,000 in June, while the number of visitors from Europe rose 2% to 2.241 million, according to the Office for National Statistics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Griffin, who has been leader since 1999, said he had had \\"more than long enough\\" in charge and had seen off both external and internal attempts to \\"destroy\\" the party in recent years. While May's European election results had been \\"brutally hard\\", he said the party was capable of \\"winning\\" again. Mr Griffin has been replaced as acting chairman by Adam Walker. The 55-year old, who will take the new role of party president, lost his seat in the European Parliament in May. The party has suffered a string of electoral setbacks in recent years, getting just over 1% of the vote in May's European elections and losing the majority of its local council seats in England. In a statement on the party's website, Mr Griffin said he had stepped down voluntarily at a meeting of the party's national executive committee on Saturday. He insisted he would remain an \\"active\\" member of the BNP and be on hand to offer advice to Mr Walker and whoever was elected leader in a leadership ballot due to take place next year. \\"The decision was mine and mine alone, though it involved a lengthy and constructive discussion between the entire collective leadership,\\" he wrote. He suggested the party was in a more stable financial and political position than it had been for some time. \\"I had initially hoped to hand the responsibility over several years ago, but when a concerted effort was made to destroy the BNP from both outside and within, I decided that it was my duty to stay and steer our movement through the storm,\\" he said. \\"The leadership team is united as to the way ahead and, once again, the BNP - for all that there are many improvements to be made - is the only effectively functioning, genuine nationalist game in town.\\" Mr Griffin has been the public face of the BNP for more than a decade, during which time the party increased its popular support despite being dogged by allegations of racism, which it has always rejected. Under his leadership, the party's vote in European elections had increased from 1.1% in 1999 to 3.9% in 2004 and 6.2% in 2009, when Mr Griffin was himself elected as an MEP. In 2009, Mr Griffin was invited to appear on Question Time, the BBC's flagship political discussion show, a decision which led to widespread demonstrations at the time. In recent years, the party's fortunes have declined steeply amid internal fighting. Andrew Brons, the BNP's other representative in the European Parliament, quit the party in 2012 to become an independent, while Mr Griffin was challenged for his position last year. Mr Griffin, who was declared bankrupt earlier this year, failed to secure re-election as MEP for the North West of England in May as the party lost its deposit in all the UK's electoral regions in which it fielded candidates. The BNP blamed its poor performance on the rise of UKIP, which it said had become the party of choice for protest votes about Europe and immigration. In his statement, Mr Griffin said while it would be wrong to blame him solely for the party's electoral slump, he accepted responsibility and stepping down would prevent the risk of \\"months of internal friction\\". And he defended his track record during his years in charge. \\"A party which, until I took it over, had only ever held a single council seat for a few months, is now on course to have had unbroken elected presence in British politics for 17 years,\\" he said. In its own statement, the BNP said Mr Walker, from Spennymoor, County Durham, \\"has accepted the role of acting chairman of the British National Party after Nick Griffin stepped aside\\" \\"The full national executive are united in their support for Adam in this role,\\" it added. This article was about:","completion":"This article discusses the resignation of Nick Griffin as the leader of the British National Party (BNP) in 2014, a position he held since 1999.

Mr. Griffin was replaced by Adam Walker as the acting chairman. Despite a series of electoral setbacks, Mr. Griffin expressed optimism for the party's future and its capability to win again.

The surgery Planinic underwent after breaking his hand during a game against the Washington Wizards falls under the realm of sports news and updates. The world of professional sports is highly competitive, and athletes often push their bodies to the limit in order to excel in their chosen field. Injuries, unfortunately, are a common occurrence in this high-stress environment, and it is crucial for athletes to receive proper medical attention to treat injuries and prevent further complications. In this particular case, Zoran Planinic has broken his left hand, which is a significant setback for any basketball player, as the ability to use both hands effectively is essential for various aspects of the game such as dribbling, passing, and shooting. Being a guard, this injury can be even more impactful, as guards are typically responsible for handling the ball and controlling the pace of the game. The fact that Planinic needed surgery on his broken hand underlines the severity of the injury and the necessity of proper rehabilitation and recovery to avoid long-term issues. The timeline for his recovery is uncertain, and the text mentions that he will be out \\"indefinitely,\\" which implies that there is no clear date set for when he will be able to return to the court.

Mr Besigye said the result had been rigged, while foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation. In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence. Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission \\"lacked independence and transparency\\", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that \\"those Europeans are not serious\\". \\"Transparency is what we've been voting for,\\" he added. Mr Besigye had vowed to march to the headquarters of the Electoral Commission to ask for a copy of the official declaration of results. Official results gave Mr Museveni nearly 61% of the votes, with Mr Besigye taking 35%. It was the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, had lost to Mr Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni's personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters.

Mr. Besigye, on the other hand, is not happy about the voting. He was even not allowed to leave his house, which made him and his wife upset. They felt their home was like being surrounded by a lot of soldiers. Mr. Besigye doesn't agree with the result of the vote because he thinks it wasn't fair, like when someone peeks during a hide-and-seek game. Some people from foreign countries agreed with him saying the voting was scared and was not friendly. But Mr. Museveni said he didn't cheat. He said Mr. Besigye is just trying to make people upset and disturb the peace. He also commented on some Europeans who criticized him saying they aren't serious and he firmly believes in transparency, like sharing all the class notes with everyone. Mr. Besigye wanted to go to the place where votes were counted to see the final result sheet himself, but the official result gave Mr. Museveni almost 61% votes and he got to be the leader again. Mr. Besigye was once Mr. Museveni's personal doctor when they were fighters, like teammates in a game, but Besigye was not able to beat Museveni this time either.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.

Answer:","completion":"Gerald R. Ford was the President when Nelson Rockefeller served as Vice President of the United States. Now, let's explore this period in more detail. Nelson Rockefeller was the 41st Vice President of the United States, serving under President Gerald R. Ford from December 19, 1974, to January 20, 1977. Rockefeller, a Republican, was also a well-known businessman, philanthropist, and a prominent figure in the U.S. political landscape, belonging to the influential Rockefeller family. President Gerald R. Ford assumed the position following the resignation of Richard Nixon due to the Watergate scandal, becoming the 38th President of the United States. Ford, a Republican as well, was a former Congressman from Michigan who had been appointed as Vice President, succeeding Spiro Agnew, before his rise to the presidency. Upon taking office as President, Ford needed to choose a Vice President as outlined in the 25th Amendment, and he selected Nelson Rockefeller. After Ford announced his choice, the U.S. Congress confirmed Rockefeller as Vice President through a majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. During their tenure, President Ford and Vice President Rockefeller focused on addressing the economic challenges of that time, including high inflation and unemployment. This period was marked by the \\"stagflation\\" phenomenon, a situation where stagnant economic growth and high inflation occurred simultaneously. Under Ford's administration, measures were taken to guarantee fiscal responsibility, stabilize the economy, and restore public trust after the Watergate scandal. In the 1976 presidential elections, President Ford sought re-election but faced a tough challenge from the conservative wing of his own party, led by Ronald Reagan. Rockefeller, who was regarded as a moderate Republican, stepped down as Ford's running mate to improve Ford's chances of securing the nomination. Ultimately, Gerald Ford won the Republican nomination but lost the presidential election to Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter. In summary, Gerald R. Ford was the President when Nelson Rockefeller served as Vice President of the United States. Their administration navigated complex economic challenges and attempted to rebuild public trust in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gravitational Potential Energy is affected by position. Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask?

Their job was apolitical; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law.

Both political confabs should inspire us all Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you should appreciate the important role that presidential nominating conventions play. As a political Independent, I certainly do. By H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Former president Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic convention Wednesday night. By H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Former president Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic convention Wednesday night. I was interested in nearly everything and inspired and sometimes entertained by much of what I saw or heard from Tampa last week and Charlotte this week. Now we're in for lots of fact and some fiction before the November election. As an Independent, I find it equally challenging to watch the players on both political teams. Looking back at Charlotte and Tampa, aside from the two candidates and their spouses, Bill Clinton clearly stole the show. The most remarkable thing about him is that he's made many or most of us forget or forgive about his sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky while he was in the White House. For the Democrats, aside from President Obama himself, Clinton clearly is the person who can deliver the most votes. On the Republican side, Mitt Romney must pretty much do it by himself. With former president George W. Bush staying on the sidelines (he was barely mentioned in Tampa), there is no other GOP personality who can make major contributions for Romney. No matter how the immediate post-convention chatter shapes up, you should keep your eyes and ears on the presidential campaign. Nothing else — not even the start of the football season or the upcoming Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series— should steal you from following political developments.

Movement generally involves converting energy from one form to another to produce motion. The following are examples of things that require energy to move: 1. Animals: As mentioned in your statement, animals require energy to move. They obtain this energy from food, which mainly consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These nutrients are broken down during cellular respiration, where stored chemical energy is converted into the usable form of energy called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP powers the contraction of muscles, allowing animals to move. 2. Humans: Similar to animals, humans also require energy to move. The human body goes through the same cellular respiration process to generate ATP, which fuels muscle contractions and facilitates movement such as walking, running, and lifting objects. 3. Plants: Although plants don't move in the typical sense, they do exhibit certain types of movement such as growth, phototropism (movement towards light), and the opening and closing of stomata. They require energy for these movements, which they obtain through photosynthesis (converting sunlight into chemical energy). 4. Machines: All types of machinery, from vehicles and industrial equipment to household appliances, require energy to move or perform their intended function. This energy may come from electricity, fossil fuels, or other energy sources, depending on the design and purpose of the machine. 5. Natural phenomena: Numerous natural phenomena require energy to produce motion. Examples include earthquakes, which result from the shifting of tectonic plates; ocean currents, powered by the energy from wind and the sun; and weather patterns, driven by the uneven distribution of solar energy across the Earth's surface. 6. Microorganisms: Microscopic entities like bacteria, fungi, and protozoa require energy to move and perform other cellular functions. They extract energy from their surroundings, either through the consumption of organic material or via other metabolic processes. 7. Chemical reactions: Molecular motion and chemical reactions also require energy. Reactants must possess sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier for a reaction to occur. Additionally, molecular motion plays a crucial role in enabling chemical reactions by allowing molecules to collide and react with one another. 8. Astronomical bodies: Celestial objects such as planets, stars, and galaxies also require energy to move. They obtain this energy from gravity, which causes them to follow specific orbital paths. Meanwhile, stars convert nuclear energy into light and heat through nuclear fusion processes, radiating energy out into space. In summary, energy is required to facilitate movement in a wide variety of contexts, from the cellular to the cosmic scale. This fundamental principle underscores the critical role energy plays in supporting life and driving the countless processes and mechanisms that occur in the universe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The name \\"Melanesia\\" (\\"islands of dark [people]\\") is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \\"land of the blacks\\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. The concept among Europeans of Melanesia as a distinct region evolved gradually over time as their expeditions mapped and explored the Pacific. Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an 'old black race' in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin.

Their star puppy, Lauren, develops an infection from having stepped on a nail, so they use Bingo in place of her for their next act, The Ring of Fire. But Bingo is afraid of fire (due to the fact that he experienced it as a young puppy and furthermore lost his own mother that way) and chickens out. In rage of the embarrassment, Steve gets ready to shoot him, but his wife, Ginger stops him and while trying to restrain him, tells Bingo to start over and find a family. Bingo does so when Ginger finally agrees with Steve to kill him when Bingo mistakes her orders several times. The next day, Chuckie and his brother, Chickie along with friends of his go for a bike ride but Chuckie is too slow. To prove to the clan that he isn't scared, he attempts to jump a bridge (with sunglasses), but based on lack of skills, nearly kills himself in the process.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Western artist R.V. (Ron) Jahns creates his unique western wildlife paintings by tapping into his vast experience of true life. He had rich western experiences out in the mountains in the great Northwest. Ron paints from the heart and his experience as a cowboy in the west. He has a particular passion for the mountains from Eastern Oregon to Alaska and draws from his many years of mountain adventures as inspiration for his western paintings. Born and raised on a farm, this cowboy artist is well knowledgeable with the subjects of his Western art. Ron struggles for historical accuracy in his western cowboy paintings when an artist gives a false description of the facts about cowboys in the west! Living in Alaska for 17 years added a new factor to Ron's western art. As a hunter and fisherman he observed the wildlife in its natural setting and has conveyed this spirit to his canvas. Ron's western art can be viewed throughout the United States, in Europe and through occasional private showings. You can find western wildlife paintings by Ron at various art shows throughout the year. For a list of art shows the Cowboy Artist will be attending, visit his Art Show page. Although a self-taught western artist, Ron himself has taught painting in colleges and through private lessons. Ron is quite a storyteller and the last of an old kind of cowboy poets and western storytellers. If you've met Ron at the Flea Markets in Sumpter, Oregon then you no doubt have already had a taste of his knack for telling tall tales and sharing his original cowboy poems of true life on the ranch.

Tweet: @KJonesMorehouse Neva been Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the language and content of the tweet The tweet is very short, with only one clear keyword in it: \\"@KJonesMorehouse Neva been\\". Step 2: Identify the sentiment-related words Since there are only two real content words in the tweet (\\"Neva\\" and \\"been\\"), we will focus on those for sentiment analysis. \\"Neva\\" is an informal way of writing \\"never\\" and \\"been\\" is just a past participle of \\"be\\". Step 3: Determine the sentiment of the keyword \\"Neva\\" can be used to express a negative sentiment, as it may indicate a lack of experience or association with something. However, it's not strong enough to classify it as purely negative, as the context might change its meaning. The other keyword, \\"been,\\" does not have any inherent sentiment value. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet Without more context or information, it's challenging to assess the sentiment of this tweet because it's quite ambiguous. However, given that \\"Neva\\" could express a lack of experience or association, the sentiment of the tweet could be leaning slightly towards negative or neutral.

Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died.

Option i. yes: In the premise, it is specifically mentioned that \\"an older woman is sitting in a cage.\\" This statement directly confirms the hypothesis that \\"a woman is sitting.\\" The hypothesis does not mention any age or location restrictions for the woman, and it simply states that a woman is sitting, which is confirmed in the premise. Therefore, this option is valid. Option ii. it is not possible to tell: This option is suggesting that there might be some uncertainty in determining if the hypothesis is true, given the premise. However, as explained in option i, the premise clearly states that a woman is sitting, which confirms the hypothesis. The fact that she is also with two rabbits in a cage does not create any obstacles or contradictions to the hypothesis, so the hypothesis remains true. Thus, this option is not valid. Option iii. no: This option implies that the hypothesis cannot be true, given the premise.

I got my first real job when l was ten.My dad, Benjamin, injured his back working in a cardboard - box factory and was retrained as a hairstylist.He rented space in a little mall and gave his shop the fancy name of Mr.Ben's Coiffure. The owner of the shopping center gave Dad a discount on his rent for cleaning the parking lot three nights a week, which meant getting up at 3 a.m. to pick up rubbish. Dad used a little machine that looked like a lawn mower.Mom and I emptied rubbish cans and picked up rubbish by hand.It took two to three hours to clean the lot.I'd s1eep in the car on the way home. I did this for two years, but the lessons I learned have lasted a lifetime, I acquired discipline and a strong work morality , and learned at an early age the importance of balancing life's competing interests---in my case, school, homework and a job.This really helped during my senior year of high school, when l worked 40 hours a week flipping hamburgers at a fast-food joint while taking a full load of college-prepared courses. _ .I attended the U.S.Military Academy and went on to receive graduate degree in law and business from Harvard.Later, I joined a big Los Angeles law firm and was elected to the California state committee.In these jobs and in everything else I've done, I have never forgotten those nights in the parking lot.The experience taught me that there is dignity in all work and that if people are working to provide for themselves and their families, that is something we should honor. Question: Which of the following is NOT true of the author? Yes or no, is the answer \\"He regretted having worked in the parking lot.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"He regretted having worked in the parking lot\\" is NOT true of the author. The author never expressed any feelings of regret about working in the parking lot. Instead, he spoke of the experience as having imparted significant life lessons to him, such as discipline, strong work ethics, and the importance of balance in life. He described how these lessons have served him well throughout his life, from his senior year in high school juggling work and college-preparatory courses, to his time at the U.S. Military Academy, his graduate studies at Harvard, and his professional career in law and public service in California. He also stressed that the experience taught him to value and respect all forms of work, reinforcing the lesson he learned from his parents about the worthiness of exertion to provide for oneself and one's family. Therefore, it could be accurately inferred that instead of regretting his time working in the parking lot, he viewed it as an integral and valuable part of his personal and professional development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

However, it can be assumed that upon release, the prisoners had the freedom to choose from a variety of meals that were not available to them while incarcerated. This could include meals from restaurants or fast food establishments, homemade dishes prepared by family or friends, or even simple comfort food they may have missed while in prison. The choice would likely vary based on individual preferences, cultural backgrounds, and personal circumstances. Additionally, some of the released inmates may have received support and guidance from rehabilitation programs or halfway houses, which could also influence the type of meal they had upon their release. Ultimately, the inmates' first meal out of jail would be a highly individualized choice and not necessarily determined by any specific procedure or protocol."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tanya is jealous of Betty's hair although","completion":"Tanya is jealous of Betty's hair although she tries her best to stifle her envy and appreciate her own unique qualities; she cannot help but constantly compare her thin, straight locks to Betty's thick, voluminous curls that appear effortlessly perfect. Every day, Tanya enters school and sees Betty's gorgeous hair cascading down her back, and the feeling starts anew. She admires the way Betty's curls never seem to fall flat, bounce gracefully in the sunlight, and perfectly frame her face. In contrast, her own straight hair often feels lifeless and limp, requiring careful styling and product application to achieve a semblance of volume. In an attempt to boost her self-esteem and transform her hair into something she can be proud of, Tanya decides to research haircare tips and tricks online. She discovers a plethora of information about proper hair nutrition, styling techniques, and recommended products that could potentially improve the appearance and health of her tresses. Over time, she starts incorporating her findings into her daily routine, experimenting with different styles and formulas in the hope of enhancing her natural beauty. As she becomes more confident with her own hair, Tanya starts to understand that comparisons to Betty are not only unwarranted but also detrimental to her self-esteem. She begins to appreciate that her straight hair possesses unique benefits, such as being more manageable and taking less time to style than Betty's luscious curls. Moreover, Tanya discovers that her straight hair serves as an adaptable canvas, allowing her to try out new and bold styles with relative ease. In addition to evolving her haircare routine, Tanya develops an interest in fashion and makeup, as well as focusing on her academics and extracurricular activities. By shifting her focus towards enhancing her individuality and pursuing her passions, she gradually learns to accept and even love her own hair, embracing the notion that beauty comes in many forms and cannot be defined by a single attribute. Ultimately, Tanya realizes that jealousy is a useless emotion and that, instead of envying what others have, she should be grateful for her own unique qualities and strive to be the best version of herself. Through self-discovery and personal growth, she manages to overcome her jealousy of Betty's hair, with newfound confidence and appreciation for her own natural beauty. Even though the initial sentiment of jealousy towards Betty's hair remained as an influence in self-improvement, Tanya's journey led her to self-acceptance and the understanding that comparisons only serve to hinder one's path to true contentment.

Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident.At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Neat Stuff is an American alternative comic book series created by Peter Bagge and published by Fantagraphics. It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology. Described by Dez Skinn in \\"Comix: The Underground Revolution\\" as the work which \\"threw Peter Bagge into the limelight\\", Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradley characters' story in \\"Hate. - Hate is a comic book by writer - artist Peter Bagge . First published by Fantagraphics in 1990 it ran for 30 issues , and was one of the best - selling alternative comics of the 1990s , at its height selling 30,000 copies an issue . In 2000 Bagge revived the series in Hate Annual , a yearly comic which continues the story after Hate in short stories , in addition to Bagge 's writings on Libertarianism and culture and topical cartoons . Hate follows the life of Buddy Bradley , in a continuation of events from Bagge 's strip \`\` The Bradleys '' from former publications Neat Stuff . It is set for the first half in Seattle and later in suburban New Jersey . Buddy has to deal with the end of adolescence , reluctantly growing up , his relationships with a host of unpleasant acquaintances he has to class as friends , working in dead - end jobs and having no direction in life . Bagge used memories of events from his own life as material . Hate has been referenced by many commentators as an important example of Generation X comic culture and grunge culture in general . Bagge tends to see the parallels with the grunge lifestyle as largely coincidental , as he was referencing events that had happened to him ten years previous . The comic was also released in Europe in the mid 90s as Spanish , Italian and German language editions , the Spanish Odio proving particularly popular . - Underground comix are small press or self-published comic books which are often socially relevant or satirical in nature. They differ from mainstream comics in depicting content forbidden to mainstream publications by the Comics Code Authority, including explicit drug use, sexuality and violence. They were most popular in the United States between 1968 and 1975, and in the United Kingdom between 1973 and 1974. - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Alternative comics cover a range of American comics that have appeared since the 1980s, following the underground comix movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Alternative comics present an alternative to mainstream superhero comics which in the past have dominated the American comic book industry. Alternative comic books span a wide range of genres, artistic styles, and subjects. - Peter Bagge (pronounced , as in \\"bag\\"; born December 11, 1957) is an American cartoonist whose best-known work includes the comics \\"Hate\\" and \\"Neat Stuff\\". His stories often use black humor and exaggerated cartooning to dramatize the reduced expectations of middle-class American youth. He won two Harvey Awards in 1991, one for best cartoonist and one for his work on \\"Hate\\". Bagge has expressed his libertarian views in features for \\"Reason\\". - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction. - The Harvey Awards are given for achievement in comic books.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The researchers, led by Hwang Woo-suk, insist they cloned an Afghan hound, only to help investigate human disease, including the possibility of cloning stem cells for treatment purposes. But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther. \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago. Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed. Uncertainties about the health and life span of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis. Wilmut and others _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\" The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted with more than 1,000 cloned embryos. In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"energy usage.\\" This choice best describes the process of how a gasoline engine works. In a gasoline engine, the gasoline (a type of fossil fuel) is injected into a combustion chamber, where it is mixed with air. This mixture is then compressed by a piston and ignited by a spark plug. The resulting explosion from the ignited gasoline-air mix is what pushes the piston down, thus producing mechanical energy that powers the engine. Therefore, using a gasoline engine essentially involves converting the chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy — essentially energy usage. Also, during this process, gasoline is consumed. Vaporization, adding heat, and evaporation are parts of the process, but they don't fully encompass the whole mechanic of how a gasoline engine operates.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. Question: What is the similar belief of the true competitors and those with a desire to fail?

Process: - Prophase, the chromosomes become visible - Centrioles separate to move to opposite poles - Metaphase, the chromosomes line up in the center - Anaphase, the chromatids separate - Are pulled apart - Telophase, the chromosomes gather at opposite poles - Two new nuclear membranes form - The cell membranes pinch - Divide into two individual cells - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more basidia is available happens, how will it affect more anaphese happens. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"To understand the potential effect of the perturbation hypothesis, let's first break down the process of cell division and the role of basidia in this context. Cell division is a crucial biological process that occurs in living organisms to grow, repair, and maintain their tissues and organs. In eukaryotic cells, such as plants and animals, this process is known as mitosis. During mitosis, a cell replicates its genetic material, divides its cytoplasm and organelles, and ultimately forms two identical daughter cells. The process of mitosis can be divided into five main stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 1. Prophase: During this stage, the chromosomes condense and become visible under the microscope. The nucleolus disappears, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. The centrioles (only present in animal cells) start to separate and move towards the opposite poles of the cell. 2. Prometaphase: The nuclear membrane breaks down, and the spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of each chromosome, which are specialized protein structures located at the centromere. 3. Metaphase: The chromosomes, connected to the spindle fibers, line up at the equator of the cell, also known as the metaphase plate, to ensure equal and proper segregation of genetic material during cell division. 4. Anaphase: In this phase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell by the shortening of spindle fibers. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical copy of genetic material. 5. Telophase: During the final stage of mitosis, the chromosomes gather at the opposite poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, the spindle apparatus disassembles, and the nucleoli reappear. Cytokinesis follows, where the cell membrane pinches and divides the cytoplasm, ultimately separating and resulting in two individual daughter cells. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, in which more basidia are available. Basidia are specialized cells found in certain fungi, such as mushrooms and yeasts. They are involved in the production of spores for sexual reproduction. In this context, basidia are not directly associated with the process of mitosis or anaphase in eukaryotic cells; instead, they play a role in the reproduction of the fungal organism. So, assuming more basidia are available, the affected organism may have an increased capacity for spore production, leading to a higher probability of sexual reproduction and, potentially, a greater overall population size. However, this increase in basidia and subsequent spore production would not directly affect the process of anaphase during mitosis. In conclusion, although the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more basidia could have an impact on the sexual reproduction of certain fungi, it does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of anaphase during mitosis. The anaphase stage is mainly governed by molecular mechanisms and interactions within the eukaryotic cells, and an increased presence of basidia within a fungal organism would not directly influence this process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. During the 1991-92 season, West Indies played mainly one-day cricket, taking part in tournaments in Sharjah--where Ambrose took seven wickets, including an analysis of five for 53--and Australia, and took part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In this tournament, Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals. Ambrose returned home to play twice for the Leeward Islands in January 1992. In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for the first time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, all of which were won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing regulation which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began the final day of the match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match. Returning to play for Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and suffering from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets at an average of 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games.","completion":"This text is about Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, a former cricketer from Antigua who played for the West Indies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Six Chinese Communist Party investigators have been sentenced to between four and 14 years in jail after they drowned a local official during a botched interrogation that has shone light on China's secretive extrajudicial processes. Cheng Wenjie, the deputy director of the Commission for Discipline Inspection in the eastern city of Wenzhou, received the longest sentence of the six for his role in the death of Yu Qiyi, according to a copy of the court verdict given to CNN by the victim's wife. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Yu, 41, the chief engineer at a state-owned company in the same city, died at a local hospital on April 9, a month after being detained over his role in a land deal. When","completion":"continuing this news story, the most logical completion would involve the subsequent consequences of the sentences, reactions from various parties, and measures taken by the Chinese government and public in response to the incident. When the news of the verdict broke, it sparked outrage and calls for justice from the victim's family, human rights organizations, and the public. Yu's wife, Li Xueling, and their two children start receiving support from their local community, including fundraising for their living expenses and the children's education. In response to the tragedy and the growing discontent, the central government announces an investigation into the extrajudicial practices employed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials. It pledges to review the existing disciplinary measures and implement reforms to ensure the rights and safety of those under investigation by the party. The incident further ignites heated discussions on social media platforms and local newspapers about the lack of transparency in China's legal system, urging for more openness in the criminal justice system and the accountability of CCP officials. Activists and human rights advocates capitalize on this momentum to push for abolishing extrajudicial detention centers, known as \\"shuanggui\\" or \\"liuzhi\\" facilities. These centers have long been criticized for being sites of abuse and torture. Simultaneously, several high-ranking CCP officials issue public apologies for the incident and promise to cooperate with the investigation. They vow to take measures, such as suspending or demoting officials linked to the case and implementing stricter guidelines pertaining to interrogations to avoid similar incidents in the future. These measures, they claim, would help restore public trust in the government's disciplinary system. Meanwhile, the Chinese Bar Association, along with other human rights NGOs, initiates a nationwide campaign to educate people about their rights during criminal investigations, aiming to prevent more extrajudicial abuses from taking place. They provide free legal aid to those who have suffered human rights abuses and lobby for the establishment of independent oversight over the CCP's disciplinary processes. While the public remains skeptical about the promised reforms, the case helps to start a broader conversation on human rights and justice in the country. As the government continues to face pressure coming from the citizenry and human rights organizations, some important steps are taken to improve the legal system and ensure that extrajudicial killings, like that of Yu Qiyi, are a thing of the past. With international attention focused on China's human rights issues, the Chinese government is forced to confront the problem and demonstrate that it is committed to addressing these concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The victory of the DPJ in the 2009 elections suggested the prospect of a significant warming in relations between Japan and China. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) winning the elections in 2009 did indeed indicate a potential improvement in the relationship between Japan and China. Prior to this victory, the political landscape in Japan had been dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for a long time. The LDP's approach to foreign policy matters had often been viewed as somewhat conservative and their relationship with China had consequently been strained in various aspects. The DPJ's victory represented a paradigm shift in Japanese politics, as the party promised a more open, progressive, and pragmatic approach to foreign policy. The election of the DPJ, under the leadership of Yukio Hatoyama, was perceived as a chance for both Japan and China to reassess their bilateral ties and seek common ground on various contentious issues. One of the key aspects of the DPJ's policy towards China included increased economic cooperation and pursuing stronger diplomatic ties. The DPJ proposed to move past historical and territorial disputes that had long plagued the relationship between the two nations, and instead focus on enhancing mutual trust and partnership. Moreover, the DPJ's proposed foreign policy centered around the creation of an \\"East Asian community,\\" which would include both Japan and China, alongside other regional neighbors. This community would be built on the foundations of shared values and interests, with the ultimate aim of fostering regional peace, stability, and prosperity. In this context, the DPJ's victory in the 2009 elections indeed signaled a period of warming in the relationship between Japan and China. The leadership change brought with it an opportunity for renewed dialogue between the two countries, as well as greater potential for collaboration on regional issues and the development of strong, mutually-beneficial ties. However, it is important to note that the prospects of improving relations between Japan and China should be considered within a broader geopolitical context, which also includes economic competition, military rivalry, and other factors that naturally affect relations between neighboring countries. While the DPJ's victory in 2009 opened doors for greater cooperation and dialogue, it may not have been the sole factor in determining the future of the relationship between the two powerful nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Suzannah Hills. PUBLISHED:. 09:41 EST, 30 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:24 EST, 30 October 2013. Betrayal: Richard Hallam, 32, ordered drugs to bring on a miscarriage from China and then secretly administered them to his pregnant girlfriend. A cheating boyfriend who tried to abort his unborn child by secretly giving his pregnant partner miscarriage-inducing drugs has been jailed for 10 years. Richard Hallam, 32, had been seeing another woman when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant with a child he didn’t want. So he purchased an abortion drug called Mifemiso from a website in China, a court heard. While he waited for the drugs to arrive, his partner who can’t be named for legal reasons began suffering complications with the pregnancy. Hallam comforted her but the court heard he was also texting the company supplying the drug, saying he was ‘desperate’ to receive them. Hallam, from Poole, later gave his unsuspecting girlfriend the drug without her knowing. The horrified woman only discovered that she had taken it when she was later told by police who were investigating Hallam for an unconnected attack on another woman. The court was told Hallam had masterminded two savage hammer attacks on a fitness instructor his girlfriend suspected he was sleeping with. Kelly Batchelor, then 31, was hit on the head with a lump hammer by thugs Hallam hired in two separate attacks in Poole, Dorset. Hallam was arrested for ordering the attacks, carried out by three of his friends, andwas jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH at Winchester Crown Court. While police investigated Hallam for the attack, they discovered his plot to poison his unborn child. He pleaded guilty to one count of administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage and was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court. Both sentences are to run consecutively. Medication: It is not known whether the abortion drug - similar to that shown above - caused any damage to the unborn child or to Hallam's girlfriend's ability to have children. It is not known whether the tablets had any detrimental affect on his girlfriend’s unborn child or her ability to have children in the future. Rebecca Austin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court that Hallam began making inquiries into Mifemiso after his girlfriend told him she was pregnant last November. On November 9, Hallam began texting the drug supply firm in China. Miss Austin said: 'Messages were found on Hallam’s phone which were sent to a number, the dialling code of which suggested was in China. He sent a message saying, \\"Please try. I’m desperate\\".' Miss Austin continued: 'Hallam was arrested in relation to this offence where he made a comment to officers indicating that she had wanted him to give her \\"it\\", obviously a reference to the Mifemiso.' After Hallam's allegation his girlfriend had wanted to take the drug, she was also arrested by police, but denied having any knowledge of it and was released without charge. In court: Hallam was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court for administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage. The sentence will run consecutively with an eight year jail term for another crime. James Martin, defending, said: 'Mr Hallam had been taking a large amount of Valium and mixing it with alcohol, and it is right to say was not someone who was really in the right state of mind.' In sentencing Hallam for the poison plot, Judge John Harrow imposed an order to keep the victim anonymous because of the horror and trauma she has suffered. He told Hallam: 'You now admit administering drugs, intending to cause her to miscarry. 'I have to stress it cannot be established how many times you did this or whether it caused her to bleed. 'The effect of these events were clearly traumatic on (the victim) to say the least, not just what I am dealing with now but the fact that she was arrested twice. 'The case is serious, so much so that custody is inevitable because you put the life of anunborn child at risk.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Options: - feel pain - fly - pass water - die of cancer - feel pleasure The answer is \\"pass water\\" because Answer:","completion":"The animals were not thirsty, so when they were by the river, they chose to \\"pass water.\\" This option is logical and most relevant among the other options provided which include \\"feel pain,\\" \\"fly,\\" \\"die of cancer,\\" and \\"feel pleasure.\\" Here is a detailed explanation of why \\"pass water\\" is the most suitable choice. Thirst is a basic instinct that drives animals to seek out water for survival. But when animals are not thirsty, they may not have the same urge to drink. In this situation, their proximity to the river provides them with an opportunity to engage in other activities related to water, which in this case, is \\"pass water.\\" \\"Pass water\\" can be interpreted as the act of urinating, a natural bodily function essential for maintaining overall health and comfort of an animal. By selecting this option, the animals are engaging in a behavior that is necessary to preserve their well-being, and it aligns better with their needs than the other provided options. Let's analyze the other options briefly: 1. Feel pain: This option doesn't make much sense because there's no indication of the animals facing any injury or distress in the situation presented. It's not a direct consequence of being near the river. 2. Fly: Although some animals may possess the ability to fly, it is not directly related to the fact that they are by the river and not thirsty. Flying doesn't provide a clear explanation for how the animals utilize their time by the river. 3. Die of cancer: This option is not relevant to the question, as cancer is a complex disease and not an immediate result of animals being near a river. It's inappropriate and doesn't offer any logical connection with the given scenario. 4. Feel pleasure: While it is possible for animals to feel pleasure, it is not specifically linked to the fact that they are by the river and not thirsty. The term \\"feel pleasure\\" is also notably vague and needs more context in order to be considered a direct, clear response to the question. In conclusion, the answer \\"pass water\\" is the most logical choice among the options provided. It pertains to a natural and essential behavior that animals may exhibit when they are near a source of water, even if they are not feeling thirsty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his first television show,The Naked Chef, Oliver taught everyone to make simple but delicious food. In Jamie's Kitchen, he taught young people how to prepare meals. His next show,Jamie's School Dinners, is about changing the food that students eat. Oliver saw that some schools in Britain were serving junk food--food that is easy to eat but unhealthy. Although it can be delicious, junk food is not very good for children. It is sometimes bad for their health, because it doesn't give them the energy they need at school. They sometimes can't think well or feel down, and they sometimes put on weight. Some of the junk food that Oliver wants to change is canned spaghetti, chicken nuggets, French fries, soda, and muffins. He encourages schools to serve fresh and health meats, vegetables and fruits. He helps the school cooks to make healthy dinners without junk food. People liked Oliver's idea of bringing quality food to schools. Thousands enjoyed his television show. But Oliver wanted them to do more than just watch. At hisFeed Me Betterwebsites, he collected over 270,000 signatures from people. Oliver sent these signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Its music video contains controversial images of cross burning , lynching and police brutality alongside images of American landmarks like the White House and Capitol building . Brother Ali has been under pressure from the recording industry due to lyrics from this song , claiming creative interference from '' somebody I do n't wan na name , but some of you probably has their cell phones . \`\` The unnamed corporation ultimately withdrew its sponsorship of Ali , causing him to truncate parts of his 2007 tour . Furthermore , on the song '' Second Time Around \`\` with Benzi and Wale , Ali makes references to being kicked off a tour followed by the line '' Verizon dissed me too , cuz I was too political . \`\` The song is notably critical of the United States government , with accusations that the political system is addicted to war .

Angels are shown similar veneration in many religions. Philologically, \\"to venerate\\" derives from the Latin verb, \\"venerare\\", meaning to regard with reverence and respect. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism. - Cross burning or cross lighting is a practice widely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, although the historical practice long predates the Klan's inceptionas far back as Peter of Bruys (11171131), who burned crosses in protest of the veneration of crosses.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

Option 1 focuses on the bus being late, which would be a reason for Jake to have more time before needing to catch the bus. This appears to be a logical and suitable choice. Option 2 focuses on the meeting being late. Although this would give Jake more time before the meeting, it doesn't address the transportation aspect, which is the bus in this case.

I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

Joel does not eat meat or fish.","completion":"(1) Eric does not eat meat or fish. Eric and Joel's friendship began when they were kids, growing up in the same neighborhood and attending the same school. Each of them was passionate about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Their unique dietary preferences played a crucial role in shaping their lives. Eric, the vegetarian, excluded meat and fish from his diet, while Joel, the pescatarian, avoided meat but allowed seafood. Throughout their childhood, Eric and Joel enjoyed learning about their respective dietary choices and incorporating that knowledge into their everyday life. Eric chose to follow a vegetarian diet for numerous reasons, including health, environmental, animal welfare, and spiritual beliefs. The vegetarian lifestyle provided him with a platform for expanding his culinary skills and discovering new, flavorful ways of experiencing plant-based food. As Eric grew older, his commitment to vegetarianism grew stronger. He educated himself on the nutrients needed for a balanced diet and protein sources that would substitute meat. These included lentils, chickpeas, tempeh, soy, and quinoa, to name a few. Combining these ingredients with fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, Eric would craft nutritious and delicious meals that satisfied his cravings and provided him with ample energy for his active lifestyle. On the other hand, Joel adopted a pescatarian diet for different reasons. He had read numerous studies on the health benefits of consuming fish that were high in Omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and trout. Joel's interest in nutrition and fitness led him to adopt this diet, which he believed would help him build lean muscle, maintain a healthy heart, and support overall mental well-being. Despite their different dietary choices, Eric and Joel shared a common goal that extended beyond the realm of personal health. They both cherished their connection to the planet and were eager to contribute toward a more sustainable future. As advocates of the value of community-supported agriculture and farmers markets, the two would often visit local outlets to buy fresh, organic produce for their meals. This shared passion for sustainability and healthy living fostered a strong bond between them that lasted well into their adult lives. Their friendship occasionally led to engaging discussions and debates on various topics. For instance, one day, Eric and Joel decided to challenge each other to a cooking contest. The objective was to create a meal that incorporated elements from both vegetarian and pescatarian diets, thus demonstrating the versatility of plant-based foods. The resulting fusion dish—a vegetable stir-fry with seared scallops, topped wiťh a miso-ginger glaze—showcased their culinary skills and mutual respect for each other's dietary choices. Drawing strength from their friendship, Eric and Joel would often collaborate on community projects, raising awareness of the importance of environmentally-conscious diets. They volunteered at local food banks, led cooking classes, and taught others the value of incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods into their regimen. In sharing their personal stories, both Eric and Joel found strength in their choice of dietary lifestyle. Fueled by their life experiences, Eric's vegetarianism and Joel's pescatarianism became a core part of their identity. While they may have chosen to exclude one or more aspects of a typical omnivorous diet, this never stopped them from living life to the fullest. Consequently, their friendship became an encapsulation of the belief that with an open mind and a creative spirit, even the most different individuals can forge a lifelong bond and make a difference in the world."},{"prompt":"Question: what is human skin made of?

The answer is:","completion":"c. It is sometimes used after surgery, as well. You may also try a partially liquid diet during a flare-up. Explanation: A liquid diet can be used after surgery to help with healing and also during a flare-up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to give the bowel some rest. This is the best option among the choices given because it can be applied during recovery or a flare-up. a) This option is not entirely correct because liquid diets are typically temporary, not a long-term solution to stop inflammation. b) This option is not suitable because it mentions Tums, which are antacids unrelated to a liquid diet. Drinking water is essential, but it's not the main focus of a liquid diet for IBD. d) This option is incorrect because it uses an incorrect dosage.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Sentence from a movie review: a tarantino movie with heart Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given phrase from the movie review, it is likely that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. Describing a movie as \\"a Tarantino movie with heart\\" suggests that the film has some of the distinctive features commonly associated with Quentin Tarantino's works, but it also possesses an emotional depth or a strong character-driven narrative that sets it apart. Quentin Tarantino is known for his unique storytelling style filled with intricate plots, non-linear narratives, witty dialogues, stylized violence, and a mix of different film genres. His movies generally receive positive reviews and have a cult following, so the comparison to a Tarantino movie could be a compliment in itself. The addition of \\"with heart\\" in the review is crucial in understanding the positive connotation of the comment. This phrase implies that the movie goes beyond the usual Tarantino trademarks and offers a deeper sense of emotion, empathy, or connection with the characters. When a film is described as having \\"heart,\\" it often means that it manages to evoke strong emotions in the viewer. It can relate to powerful performances, relatable character arcs, or a thought-provoking script that goes beyond the surface level spectacle while still providing a good dose of entertainment. In conclusion, considering the reference to Tarantino's style and the mention of \\"heart\\", the sentence most likely comes from a positive review of the movie. The reviewer seems to appreciate the film's balance between Tarantino-esque elements and its emotional core, which ultimately results in a satisfying and engaging viewing experience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

After being dumped during his 16th season because he was no longer pretty enough and suddenly cost too much, Fisher could have gone anywhere from remote Houston to distant Miami but decided instead to drop his bags in the one place that currently shadows the Lakers, taunts the Lakers, and could eventually roll over and crush the Lakers.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge? Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

The term \\"post-punk\\" was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas. Many of these artists, initially inspired by punk's DIY ethic and energy, ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement, feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody. They repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity, instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition, subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences. Artists moved beyonds punk's focus on the concerns of a largely white, male, working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes, such as three-chord progressions and Chuck Berry-based guitar riffs. These artists instead defined punk as \\"an imperative to constant change\\", believing that \\"radical content demands radical form\\". What dis the new term, post-punk, cover?","completion":"The new term, \\"post-punk\\", covered a diverse range of music styles and artists who emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These artists moved beyond the punk rock sound and ideology, exploring innovative and experimental approaches to music. Here are the key elements of post-punk: 1. Musical evolution: Post-punk artists sought to break with musical tradition, incorporating unconventional instruments, sounds, and song structures. This experimentation led to a wide array of musical styles, including gothic rock, industrial, synth-pop, and noise rock. 2. Rejection of punk rock clichés: Disillusioned with the commercialization and formulaic nature of punk rock, post-punk artists distanced themselves from the movement's emphasis on accessibility, raw simplicity, and reliance on established rock tropes. Instead, they embraced complexity, innovation, and a desire to challenge audiences. 3. Ideological diversity: Post-punk artists expanded the scope of punk's primarily white, male, working-class concerns to address broader cultural, social, and political issues. This shift enabled artists to subvert commonplaces and engage in a deeper exploration of their subject matter. 4. Constant change: Post-punk artists viewed punk as \\"an imperative to constant change,\\" driven by the belief that radical content demanded radical form. This approach enabled them to push the boundaries of traditional music genres and create unique, ground-breaking styles. In summary, the term \\"post-punk\\" covers a wide range of artists and music styles that emerged after the initial punk rock movement, characterized by a rejection of punk's commercialized and formulaic aspects, a commitment to experimentation, and a focus on diverse subject matters and ideologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She discovered cleaning the bathroom floor could be done at the same time as the rest by sliding around with wet towels tied to her feet. This is likely to work better than dry towels because wet towels provide (A) less resistance or (B) more resistance?. What is the most sensical answer between \\"wet towels\\" and \\"dry towels\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"wet towels\\" and \\"dry towels\\" for cleaning the bathroom floor while sliding around would be wet towels. Let's break down the reasoning behind this choice: If the objective is to perform chores quickly and efficiently, it is important to consider how well each method accomplishes the task. In this case, the chore is cleaning the bathroom floor. When cleaning a surface like a bathroom floor, it is common to use a combination of water, soap, and friction to remove dirt, grime, and any other contaminants. The water and soap help to dissolve and break down the dirt and grime, while friction in the form of scrubbing or wiping assists in dislodging it from the surface. Wet towels have several advantages over dry towels in this regard: 1. Wetness: A wet towel already has the necessary water content needed to help dissolve the dirt and grime on the bathroom floor. The moist nature of the towel helps to lift and remove particles more effectively than a dry towel, which would simply push dirt around without picking it up as effectively. 2. Friction: Wet towels generally provide more resistance or friction when sliding across a surface as compared to dry towels. This increased resistance allows for a more efficient scrubbing effect, helping to remove dirt and grime from the floor more effectively. In addition, the added weight of the water in the towel also helps to create more pressure between the towel and floor, further enhancing the cleaning process. 3. Soap distribution: A wet towel can more easily distribute soap across the floor, if that is desired for a deeper clean. Since the towel is already damp, any soap or cleaning solution applied to it can spread effectively on the floor surface. In comparison, dry towels have these disadvantages: 1. Less effective cleaning: As mentioned above, dry towels lack the necessary water content to dissolve dirt and grime effectively, which makes them less efficient at picking up and removing contaminants from the floor. 2. Less friction: Dry towels slide more effortlessly on surfaces and provide less resistance, which makes them less effective in scrubbing away dirt and grime from the floor. 3. Inability to distribute soap: Dry towels cannot distribute soap or cleaning solutions effectively across the floor, limiting their ability to provide a thorough clean. Considering these factors, wet towels are the more sensical choice for cleaning the bathroom floor while sliding around. They provide enhanced cleaning capabilities as compared to dry towels, enabling Sara to complete her chores more effectively and faster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hooper was born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California. His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with Tris Speaker (CF) and Duffy Lewis (LF) to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic. Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker's tough exterior. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the \\"rump-slide\\" for catching shallow fly balls. In 1910 Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of eleven consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league-high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis and Speaker hit .315 combined. Hooper's batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch that The Pittsburgh Press referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The paper noted that Hooper \\"does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.\\" On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson and Brady Anderson over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders. On October 13, 1915, in game five of the 1915 World Series, he became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Duffy contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919. Hooper became known for talking Boston manager Ed Barrow into converting Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder. what did Hooper do for Red Sox?","completion":"Hooper was a baseball player who played for the Red Sox team. He played in the outfield and was part of a group called the Golden Outfield, which was known as one of the best outfield groups in baseball history.

He also made some very impressive catches during games, like the one in the 1912 World Series, which helped the team win championships. He was a team captain in 1919, and he even talked the team manager into changing Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder.

It says demand for emergency parcels for children rose significantly - by more than 4,000 - last July and August. The government said it was helping families meet the cost of living. Figures from the Trussell Trust show 67,506 three-day emergency food supplies were provided for children by its network in July and August 2016, compared with 63,094 in the May and June - an increase of 4,412 parcels. The trust says nearly half (47%) of those 67,506 parcels went to primary-school-age children and over a quarter (27%) to children aged four and under. It says, while it welcomes the government's decision to keep free school meals for infants in England, more must be done to help struggling families during the holidays. Samantha Stapley, operations manager for England at The Trussell trust, said: \\"Over a third of all the food distributed by food banks in our network consistently goes to children, but these new figures show five- to 11-year-olds are more likely than other children to receive a food bank's help. \\"This highlights just how close to crisis many families are living - as a nation, we also must address the reasons why families with children are referred to food banks in the first place. \\"We welcome the government's decision to maintain free school lunches for children during term time - the next step must be to help families during the holidays. \\"Food banks are doing more than ever before, but voluntary organisations alone cannot stop primary school children facing hunger.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \\"Employment remains the best route out of poverty. \\"Record numbers of people are now in work, and we're helping millions of households meet the everyday cost of living and keep more of what they earn. \\"We've doubled free childcare to help parents into work, and continue to spend over Â£90bn a year on support for those who need it, including those who are bringing up a family or on a low income. \\"Budgeting advice and benefit advances are also available for anyone who needs more help.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Trussell Trust, a UK-based organization that operates over 420 food banks, has raised concerns about the possibility of many children facing hunger during the six-week school break.

Suzie attempts to hide in a storage hatch, but Jason discovers her and jams the harpoon into her chest.The next morning, the steamer SS Lazarus, containing the senior class of Lakeview High, is bound for nearby New York City for the school's graduation. The trip is chaperoned by Colleen Van Deusen (Barbara Bingham) and biology teacher Charles McCulloch (Peter Mark Richman), who has also brought along his niece, Rennie (Jensen Daggett). Before the ship sets sail, Jason (having somehow sailed Jim and Suzie's boat to the marina) grabs a hold of the ship's anchor and climbs aboard.As the night continues on, Rennie keeps having visions of Jason as a child (Timothy Burr Mirkovich) when he drowned. Jason then starts murdering the people on board, starting with a wannabe rock star named J.J. (Saffron Henderson), whom he kills by bashing her head with her own electric guitar. He then ambushes a young boxer in a sauna and hits him with a sauna rock in his chest.Tamara Mason (Sharlene Martin) goes to take a shower. Jason breaks through the door and strips Tamara, leaving her completely naked.

If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.

Nevertheless, when your telephone stops working, it can cause significant inconvenience. In some cases, you may even need to call in a professional to fix the problem. However, before you take that step, there are some simple troubleshooting techniques you can follow to determine the issue and potentially resolve it on your own. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you identify and fix common telephone problems. Step 1: Unplug the phone that doesn't work If you suspect that your telephone has stopped working, the first step is to unplug the device from the wall jack. This allows you to verify if the problem exists within the phone itself or if it's related to an external factor, such as the wiring or wall jack. Step 2: Find a phone in the house that works Once you have unplugged the non-working phone, locate another phone in your house that is functioning correctly. This phone will serve as a reference point, allowing you to compare and test with the non-working phone. Step 3: Swap the working and non-working phones Unplug the working phone and its cord from the wall jack. Next, plug in the non-working phone using the same cord and wall jack. By doing this, you can determine if the problem is with the phone itself or if it's related to the wall jack or phone cord. Step 4: Check for a dial tone After connecting the non-working phone to the working phone's wall jack and cord, lift the receiver and listen for a dial tone. If there is a dial tone, the issue was likely with the original wall jack or phone cord. If there is still no dial tone, it's likely that the problem lies with the phone itself. Step 5: Try a different phone cord If the non-working phone still doesn't have a dial tone, try swapping out the phone cord for another one. A damaged or faulty cord can often be the root of the problem. If, after testing with a different cord, the phone starts working, you have successfully narrowed down the issue and resolved it. Step 6: Consider repairing the wall jack If none of the steps above have resolved the issue, it's possible that the problem lies with the wall jack. In this case, you may need to bring in a professional technician to examine the wiring and wall jack. Ensure that you take proper safety precautions when dealing with electrical components, and if you're uncertain about any step, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Conclusion: Troubleshooting telephone issues can be a simple process if you follow these step-by-step instructions. By testing various components such as the phone, phone cord, and wall jack, you can effectively narrow down the root cause of the problem. In many cases, you'll be able to resolve the issue on your own, saving time and money. However, if you're unable to determine the source of the problem or feel uncomfortable handling electrical components, it's always best to call in a professional for assistance."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

And I was wondering How would Kendall feel afterwards? Options: I. sad; II. accomplished; III. bored; Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to predict exactly how Kendall will feel following their decision to move to a new city for a better job, as emotions can be complex and multifaceted. However, I can provide an in-depth analysis of each of the provided options and their likelihood based on various factors and circumstances. I. Sad Kendall might experience sadness after moving to a new city for a better job for several reasons. Firstly, they might miss their family, friends, and the familiarity of their old surroundings. Adjusting to a new environment and building new social connections can be challenging and may lead to feelings of loneliness. Moreover, despite having a better job, Kendall may not be satisfied with other aspects of their life or even feel overwhelmed by the increased workload or pressure in their new role. It is also possible that their expectations for the new job were too high and the reality does not meet those expectations, leading to disappointment and sadness. II. Accomplished There is a high potential for Kendall to feel accomplished after moving to a new city for a better job. This decision demonstrates a willingness to take risks, seize opportunities, and make proactive choices to improve their life. If the new job offers better compensation, more interesting work, or a stronger sense of purpose, Kendall is likely to feel a sense of achievement in making the choice to pursue it. Moreover, successfully adapting to a new environment and building a new social network can also contribute to feelings of accomplishment. It can take time and effort, but it will be rewarding once Kendall feels established in the new city. III. Bored The likelihood of Kendall feeling bored after making this life change is relatively low, but it is still possible depending on factors such as their personality, interests, and hobbies. Moving to a new city and starting a new job will likely present Kendall with numerous challenges and stimuli that will occupy their time and energy, reducing the likelihood of boredom. However, if the new city does not have the same recreational options or community events that Kendall enjoyed in their old city, they might feel bored in their spare time. Additionally, if the new job is not engaging or fulfilling, Kendall may find themselves bored at work. In conclusion, it is impossible to predict with certainty which emotion would be dominant for Kendall after moving to a new city for a better job. It is likely that they would experience a mix of emotions, including sadness, accomplishment, and even boredom at different times throughout their transition. Adjusting to a new environment, overcoming challenges, and finding long-term satisfaction in their new life would significantly influence Kendall's emotional state."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: He was climbing higher and higher, what was he scared of as he got higher?

The food, although well-presented, fell short in quality. My entree, which was supposed to be a specialty, tasted bland and lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. Additionally, my companion's dish felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long, as it was dried out and overcooked. The ambience of the restaurant was not much better. The lighting was excessively bright, creating a harsh atmosphere that made it difficult to relax and enjoy our meal. To make matters worse, the tables were situated far too close to one another, leaving little room for privacy or conversation. Lastly, the cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. The restroom was poorly maintained and lacked basic necessities such as soap and paper towels. This made us question the overall hygiene standards of the establishment. Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant and am unlikely to return. The combination of subpar service, underwhelming food, and an uncomfortable atmosphere left us feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with our dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Based on the given review, I would recommend this app to a friend with a rating of \\"Maybe\\" for several reasons. First, it's important to consider that the user found the app to be \\"good till now\\", which suggests that they have had a generally positive experience while using it, and the app's core functions are performing well. This indicates that there is some level of satisfaction with the app and that it might be a useful tool, depending on the specific needs and preferences of the friend. However, the user also mentioned that they \\"miss blue light filter\\", which implies that the app lacks a feature they deem essential or useful. Blue light filters are known for reducing eye strain and promoting better sleep quality by limiting exposure to blue light from electronic devices. Since this feature is missing, the app might not be the best fit for someone who prioritizes their eye comfort or wants to ensure better sleep hygiene. The rating of \\"Maybe\\" takes into account both the positive aspects of the app, as well as the limitations related to the lack of blue light filter. By recommending this app with a \\"Maybe\\" rating, it leaves the decision up to the friend to consider if the app's benefits still make it worthwhile despite this limitation. They might find that the overall functionality and ease of use of the app outweigh the absence of the blue light filter feature or that the feature is non-negotiable for them.

In the new issue of Rolling Stone, contributing editor Janet Reitman delivers a deeply reported account of the life and times of Boston bomber Jahar Tsarnaev. Reitman spent the last two months interviewing dozens of sources – childhood and high school friends, teachers, neighbors and law enforcement agents, many of whom spoke for the first time about the case – to deliver a riveting and heartbreaking account of how a charming kid with a bright future became a monster. Here are five revelations about Tsarnaev from our latest cover story, \\"Jahar's World\\": Dropkick Murphys Donate 300,000 to Boston Victims • As Jahar lay in the boat, surrounded by SWAT teams and police, FBI negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach. An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced Jahar to ultimately give up. • Around 2008, Jahar’s older brother Tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like \\"two people\\" were inside him. She confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist, but Zubeidat believed that religion would be the cure for her son’s inner demons and growing mental instability, and pushed him deeper into Islam. • Jahar's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, is famously diverse, but Jahar played down the fact that he was a Muslim. As his brother and mother became more religious, he did, however, attend a small Friday prayer group that met at lunchtime, and once got quite upset when a friend who'd converted to Islam talked about it in a casual way. \\"Islam wasn't casual to Jahar,\\" says one friend. \\"He took his religion seriously.\\" • Jahar shared few details of his troubled home life with even his closest friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated. His parents were both living in Russia. His two older sisters were estranged. Only Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout and judgmental of all non-Muslims, was still in Boston. When one of Jahar’s friends asked to meet Tamerlan, Jahar said, \\"No, you don't want to meet him.\\" • Jahar never spoke about 9/11. Once, though, he let slip to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, and pointed to US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes and other attacks as his rationale. ||||| The August issue of Rolling Stone hasn't even hit newstands yet, but its cover is already stirring up controversy on social media. On the front of the magazine is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving member of the duo of brothers alleged to have carried out the attacks on the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured in the blasts. The cover story is titled \\"Jahar's World\\" and is described as \\"a riveting and heartbreaking account of how a charming kid with a bright future became a monster.\\" Not surprising is the swift — and mostly negative — reaction to the cover's depiction of Tsarnaev, and Rolling Stone is already taking plenty of heat on its Facebook page. Here's some of the reaction so far: \\"Why give the guy the cover of Rolling Stone? TIME gave Charles Manson the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the Columbine shooters on the covers, too. Don't make martyrs out of these people.\\" ... \\"Very un-American. F--k you Rolling Stone. I thought it was supposed to be an honor to be on your cover?\\" ... \\"I shared this on my news feed, but not in support of your magazine, I shared it to show people how low you have gone by putting this terrorist on your cover.

The implied comparison of a suspected terrorist to rock stars, pop culture icons, and celebrities is striking – and distressing – to many. |||||","completion":"In a recent issue of Rolling Stone, contributing editor Janet Reitman provides a detailed account of the life and times of Boston bomber Jahar Tsarnaev, interviewing numerous sources, including friends, teachers, neighbors, and law enforcement agents. The article, entitled \\"Jahar's World,\\" offers insights into how Tsarnaev transformed from a charming and bright individual into a dangerous terrorist. Key revelations from the article include: 1. During the standoff in which FBI negotiators attempted to coax Jahar to surrender, a mention of his former wrestling coach may have been the trigger that convinced him to give up. 2. Around 2008, Jahar's older brother Tamerlan expressed to their mother that he felt like \\"two people\\" were inside of him. Their mother believed that religion could cure her son’s inner demons and mental instability, pushing him deeper into Islam. 3. Jahar's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, was notably diverse. Although he downplayed his Muslim identity, he attended a small Friday prayer group during lunchtime. His commitment to Islam was demonstrated when he became upset upon hearing a conversation about religion being discussed casually. 4. Jahar seldom shared the details of his unstable home life with close friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated, with his parents living in Russia and his two older sisters estranged. Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout, was the only family member still in Boston. 5. Jahar never mentioned 9/11, but once admitted to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, citing US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes as a rationale. The Rolling Stone cover featuring Tsarnaev led to controversy and sparked negative reactions on social media. Critics expressed their disappointment with the magazine for making a martyr out of the terrorist and questioned the honor of being featured on the cover of Rolling Stone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One night, when Johnny couldn't sleep, he saw a small light flickering outside his window. He was curious, so he went to the window and discovered a tiny magical fairy named Flicker. Flicker was a Flashlight Fairy, and her job was to help people who were scared of the dark. Flicker said, \\"Hi, Johnny! I know you're scared of the dark, so I'm here to give you a flashlight to help you feel safe at night.\\" Johnny was very happy and thanked Flicker. Every night, Flicker would visit Johnny and give him more flashlights to help him feel even safer. Johnny's room became full of flashlights, big and small, of all different shapes and colors. Johnny was amazed by all the different types of flashlights Flicker brought him. Soon, Johnny had so many flashlights that they started spilling out of his room and he had to store them in other parts of his house. The flashlights were in the kitchen, the living room, and even the bathroom. Johnny's family started calling him \\"Flashlight Master.\\" One day, while playing in the park, Johnny met a new friend named Melissa. Melissa was also scared of the dark, so Johnny decided to share one of his flashlights with her. They became the best of friends, and they both felt safer because they had each other and their trusty flashlights. Eventually, Johnny became brave enough to not be scared of the dark anymore. He thought to himself, \\"I have so many flashlights, maybe I can help other kids who are scared of the dark too!\\" So, Johnny started giving away his flashlights to kids who needed them more than he did. But no matter how many flashlights Johnny gave away, Flicker kept bringing him more and more. Johnny told Flicker, \\"Thank you, but I'm not scared of the dark anymore.\\" Flicker was very happy for Johnny and said, \\"That's wonderful! I'm glad I could help you face your fear.\\" As a farewell gift, Flicker decided to give Johnny one final flashlight — the most special and magical flashlight of all. This flashlight could change colors and played calming music to help Johnny sleep at night. Flicker flew away, and Johnny waved goodbye, feeling both thankful and a little sad. He realized that his magical friend had helped make his house brighter than ever. But now Johnny had a new problem to solve: My house is now full of flashlights I don't know what to do with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Media columnist What a ridiculous notion, Mark Zuckerberg scoffed shortly after the election, that his social-media company — innocent, well-intentioned Facebook — could have helped Donald Trump's win. \\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook . . . influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,\\" he said. \\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\\" In fact, voters make their decisions based on many factors, not just their \\"lived experience.\\" Disinformation spread on Facebook clearly was one — a big one. That was obvious in November. It was obvious in April when Facebook, to its credit, announced some moves to combat the spread of lies in the form of news stories. It's even more obvious now after Wednesday's news that Facebook sold ads during the campaign to a Russian \\"troll farm,\\" targeting American voters with \\"divisive social and political messages\\" that fit right in with Donald Trump's campaign strategy. The news, reported Wednesday by The Washington Post, fits right in with the findings of a fascinating recent study by Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. Analyzing reams of data, it documented the huge role that propaganda, in various forms, played in the 2016 campaign. \\"Attempts by the [Hillary] Clinton campaign to define her campaign on competence, experience, and policy positions were drowned out by coverage of alleged improprieties associated with the Clinton Foundation and emails,\\" the study said. The Trump campaign masterfully manipulated these messages. Truth was not a requirement. And Facebook was the indispensable messenger. As the Harvard study noted: \\"Disproportionate popularity on Facebook is a strong indicator of highly partisan and unreliable media.\\" We don't know everything about Facebook's role in the campaign. What we do know — or certainly ought to know by now — is to not take Facebook at its word. It always plays down its influence, trying for a benign image of connecting us all in a warm bath of baby pictures, tropical vacations and games of Candy Crush. The company recently changed its mission statement, as John Lanchester noted in a blistering takedown in the London Review of Books, mocking the \\"canting pieties\\" of such corporate efforts. What used to be just a soft ideal of \\"making the world more open and connected\\" is now giving people \\"the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\\" The new mission statement didn't specifically mention bringing Russia and the United States closer together. But Facebook managed to accomplish that anyway. Here's an undeniable fact: Facebook is about advertising. And it is so wildly successful at leveraging our eyeballs and spending power into ad dollars that it is now valued at nearly 500 billion. But for all its power and wealth, Facebook is a terribly opaque enterprise. (It recently hired former New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, a former Post managing editor, to help with \\"transparency.\\" Let's just say that she has her work cut out for her.) Facebook also has never acknowledged the glaringly obvious — that it is essentially a media company, where many of its 2 billion active monthly users get the majority of their news and information. As I've been pointing out here for more than a year, it constantly makes editorial decisions, but never owns them. When its information is false, when it is purchased and manipulated to affect the outcome of an election, the effect is enormous. When the information purveyors are associated with a foreign adversary — with a clear interest in the outcome of the American election — we're into a whole new realm of power. Would Donald Trump be president today if Facebook didn't exist? Although there is a long list of reasons for his win, there's increasing reason to believe the answer is no. I don't know how to deal with Facebook's singular power in the world. But having everyone clearly acknowledge it — including the company itself — would be a start.

The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites — 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook — means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints. Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day — including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting — but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the “civic content” posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one percent resulted from “information operations” like the Russian campaign. Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a “trends” list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend. Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a “bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms.” But he added that while Facebook “has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,” Twitter has done little and as a result, “bots have only spread since the election.” Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was “doubling down” on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company’s measures. But it declared that Twitter’s “open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote” to falsehoods. “This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,” the statement said. “We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.” ||||| Figure 1: Number of sentences by topic and candidate from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 Attempts by the Clinton campaign to define her campaign on competence, experience, and policy positions were drowned out by coverage of alleged improprieties associated with the Clinton Foundation and emails. Coverage of Trump associated with immigration, jobs, and trade was greater than that on his personal scandals. Immigration and Muslims/Islam were the two most widely covered substantive issues of the campaign. Figure 2: Number of sentences by substantive topic and candidate from media on the open web Immigration emerged as the leading substantive issue of the campaign. Initially, the Trump campaign used a hard-line anti-immigration stance to distinguish Trump from the field of GOP contenders. Later, immigration was a wedge issue between the left and the right. Pro-Trump media sources supported this with sensationalistic, race-centric coverage of immigration focused on crime, terrorism, fear of Muslims, and disease. While coverage of his candidacy was largely critical, Trump dominated media coverage. Figure 3: Valence and focus of the 100 most linked-to stories. Stories were hand-coded for topic and tone. The media landscape is distinctly asymmetric. The structure of the overall media landscape shows media systems on the left and right operate differently. The asymmetric polarization of media is evident in both open web linking and social media sharing measures. Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left. On the right, prominent media are highly partisan. Figure 4: Partisan distribution of top 250 most-linked-to media sources by total inlinks* *“Inlinks” refers to the incoming cross-media hyperlinks to stories and media sources. Twitter is a more partisan environment than the open web media landscape. Figure 5: Partisan distribution of top 250 media sites by Twitter shares Facebook is more partisan than Twitter. Figure 6: Partisan distribution of top 250 media sites by Facebook shares From all of these perspectives, conservative media is more partisan and more insular than the left. The center-left and the far right are the principal poles of the media landscape. The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum. Figure 7: Network map based on open web media from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 (explore this map in higher resolution) Conservative media disrupted. Breitbart emerges as the nexus of conservative media. The Wall Street Journal is treated by social media users as centrist and less influential. The rising prominence of Breitbart along with relatively new outlets such as the Daily Caller marks a significant reshaping of the conservative media landscape over the past several years.

On the left, the Huffington Post, MSNBC, and Vox are prominent on all platforms. On the right, Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Caller, and the New York Post are popular across platforms. Table 1: Most popular media on the right from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 Table 2: Most popular media on the left from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 On the most widely covered topic of the election, immigration, Breitbart was the most prominent site. On Twitter, it is far above the rest. Figure 10: Network map based on Twitter sharing for the topic of immigration (explore this map in higher resolution) Breitbart’s key role in the media landscape during the election was particularly pronounced in coverage of immigration. On Twitter, Breitbart stories on immigration were shared more than twice as often as stories from the Guardian, which ranked second. Disinformation and propaganda are rooted in partisanship and are more prevalent on social media. The most obvious forms of disinformation are most prevalent on social media and in the most partisan fringes of the media landscape. Greater popularity on social media than attention from media peers is a strong indicator of reporting that is partisan and, in some cases, dubious. Among the set of top 100 media sources by inlinks or social media shares, seven sources, all from the partisan right or partisan left, receive substantially more attention on social media than links from other media outlets. These sites do not necessarily all engage in misleading or false reporting, but they are clearly highly partisan. In this group, Gateway Pundit is in a class of its own, known for “publishing falsehoods and spreading hoaxes.” Disproportionate popularity on Facebook is a strong indicator of highly partisan and unreliable media. A distinct set of websites receive a disproportionate amount of attention from Facebook compared with Twitter and media inlinks. From the list of the most prominent media, 13 sites fall into this category. Many of these sites are cited by independent sources and media reporting as progenitors of inaccurate if not blatantly false reporting. Both in form and substance, the majority of these sites are aptly described as political clickbait. Again, this does not imply equivalency across these sites. Ending the Fed is often cited as the prototypical example of a media source that published false stories. The Onion is an outlier in this group, in that it is explicitly satirical and ironic, rather than, as is the case with the others, engaging in highly partisan and dubious reporting without explicit irony. ||||| Media columnist What a ridiculous notion, Mark Zuckerberg scoffed shortly after the election, that his social-media company — innocent, well-intentioned Facebook — could have helped Donald Trump's win. \\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook . . . influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,\\" he said. \\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\\" In fact, voters make their decisions based on many factors, not just their \\"lived experience.\\" Disinformation spread on Facebook clearly was one — a big one.

The town is charming, and people are warm, but Charlie's peculiar choice to keep to himself doesn't sit well with the community. However, they still grudgingly seek Charlie's help for all their lock-related issues. Things change when Ann-Marie arrives in town. With her sophisticated aura, she sparks curiosity as she moves into an old, abandoned house that carries a mysterious past. The whole town is abuzz with speculation and gossip. Charlie, too, is enamored by her presence and, despite his introverted personality, decides to introduce himself under the pretext of helping Ann-Marie change the old locks on her house. Act II: When Charlie visits Ann-Marie's house, he discovers her true identity: She is a secret agent in hiding and is currently being hunted by her former employer, a powerful criminal organization. Their leader, Viktor, is on a personal vendetta to capture and eliminate her. However, Charlie is captivated by her courage and intrigued by her perilous plight. As they spend more time together, they begin to trust each other, and Charlie learns that Ann-Marie was falsely implicated in a major crime, which led to her being targeted. To win back her freedom and clear her name, Ann-Marie is on a mission to expose undisclosed information about Viktor's organization. They slowly develop feelings for each other, which drives Charlie to help Ann-Marie in any way he can. Still, as he becomes increasingly involved in Ann-Marie's life, their safety is continually jeopardized, and they find themselves constantly on the edge. Act III: Using Charlie's skills as a locksmith and Ann-Marie's connections, they manage to uncover and decrypt sensitive information about Viktor's illicit operations. They are hesitant, but they decide to leak this information to the authorities in hopes of neutralizing the organization and absolving Ann-Marie of any alleged wrongdoings. However, this move only infuriates Viktor further, leading him to intensify his efforts to capture Ann-Marie. In the climactic showdown, Viktor and his henchmen corner Ann-Marie and Charlie in the abandoned house. Armed and dangerous, they are set to eliminate both Ann-Marie and anyone who has assisted her. The house is rigged with explosives, and a fiery countdown is initiated. However, Charlie and Ann-Marie quickly devise an escape plan using a secret tunnel underneath the house. At the most crucial moment, with no time to spare, Ann-Marie gets trapped under debris from the collapsing house. Charlie, determined to save her, manages to push her into the hidden tunnel to safety. The explosion occurs, and Viktor and his henchmen are eliminated. However, Charlie's fate is unclear. Epilogue: With the criminal organization dismantled and Ann-Marie's name cleared, the aftermath of their adventure leaves Ann-Marie questioning Charlie's survival. As the weeks go by, the town slowly returns to normal life, and Ann-Marie finds herself wondering if she will ever see Charlie again. The film concludes with a heartwarming reunion between the two, sharing their undeniable connection and proving that despite the darkness of their pasts, they managed to find the light within each other. Together, Charlie and Ann-Marie rediscover happiness and love, as they start afresh in the quaint coastal town that brought them together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What areas of the brain communicate to the primary motor cortex?\\" Context: \\"The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The areas of the brain that communicate to the primary motor cortex include the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.

Context: In 1939, Nazi Germany's largest and most powerful battleship, Bismarck, is launched in a ceremony at Hamburg with Adolf Hitler attending. The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness.

Here is a question about this article: Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. The Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands. What is the answer to this question: Where do the Lenape reside today?","completion":"Today, the majority of the Lenape people reside in the U.S. state of Oklahoma due to the United States government's Indian removal policy in the 1860s. This policy led to their relocation from their traditional lands in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory, which is now present-day Oklahoma and its surrounding areas. However, there are also Lenape communities living in other regions, including Wisconsin in the United States, Ontario in Canada, and a few still residing in their traditional homelands along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. The relocation of the Lenape people and their settlement in these various locations are attributable to factors like conflicts with Europeans, intertribal warfare, diseases introduced by settlers, and historical events like the American Revolutionary War and United States' independence that forced them to move further west."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. After reading the above, is \\"It used to be the best in the world, and his plan will help restore that accolade\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What assertion did President Obama make about the country's infrastructure?\\"? Pick from: [I] no [II] yes","completion":"The correct answer is [II] yes. The reasoning behind this answer is based on the statements made by President Obama as mentioned in the text. He stated, \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" indicating that in the past, he believes the United States held the best infrastructure globally, but it has since fallen from that standing. His proposed plan for infrastructure improvement is aimed at restoring this status. Thus, the assertion President Obama makes about the country's infrastructure, as stated in the question, is accurately represented in the provided answer choice, \\"It used to be the best in the world, and his plan will help restore that accolade\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who tells the kids that their mother is ill? Movie title: Crooklyn Movie plot: In 1973, nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris) and her brothers Clinton (Carlton Williams), Wendell (Sharif Rashed), Nate (Chris Knowings), and Joseph (Tse-Mach Washington) live in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The children live with their parents, Woody (Delroy Lindo), a struggling musician, and Carolyn (Alfre Woodard), a schoolteacher. The neighborhood is filled with colorful characters. The Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, Tony Eyes (David Patrick Kelly) continuously sings. Snuffy (Spike Lee) and Right Hand Man (N. Jeremi Duru) are glue sniffers. Vic Powell (Isaiah Washington) is a war vet who lives upstairs from the Carmichaels. One day, the Carmichael children get into a dispute with Tony who alleges that they are always throwing trash into his area. The argument escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved. Tony is still yelling when Vic comes downstairs. Vic then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store. One night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody because he isn't earning money as a musician and because he has bounced checks. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television. Carolyn later turns off the TV. Clinton turns it back on. Carolyn grabs him for disobeying her and Woody grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody drags Carolyn down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle. Carolyn kicks Woody out of the house. Woody brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip. As they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill. The trip is postponed and the family has to use candles for light. A few days later, Nate and Troy travel to the South to stay with relatives. Troy stays with her cousin, Viola (Patriece Nelson), who was adopted by Uncle...

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys stereotype or anti-stereotype about a specific target. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into four types of stereotype or anti-stereotype: gender, profession, race, and religion. Q: Passage: The ghanaian boy was starving. A:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to identify the type of stereotype or anti-stereotype present in the given passage. The passage is: \\"The ghanaian boy was starving.\\" To complete the task, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the four types of stereotype or anti-stereotype you need to classify the passage into: gender, profession, race, and religion. A stereotype is a generalized belief about a particular group, while an anti-stereotype is an idea that contradicts general assumptions about that group. 2. Read the passage carefully and identify if any stereotype or anti-stereotype is present. In our case, the passage talks about a Ghanaian boy who is starving. 3. Examine the passage for any clues related to gender: There is no mention of any generalized belief or idea related to the boy's gender, so it is not a gender stereotype or anti-stereotype. 4. Check if there are any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes related to the profession. In the passage, there is no mention of a profession, so this category does not apply. 5. Evaluate the passage for any racial stereotypes or anti-stereotypes. The mention of a Ghanaian boy being starving might be considered as a racial stereotype, as it suggests that children from Ghana, or potentially Africa, struggle with hunger and poverty. 6. Finally, look for any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes related to religion. The passage does not convey any information about the boy's religion, so this category does not apply. From the above analysis, we can conclude that the passage contains a racial stereotype."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to get scratches out of a stainless steel sink Use a scratch remover for deeper scratches. Fine scratches can usually be rubbed out with a cleaning product or an abrasive pad. However, very deep scratches that are obvious to see require scratch removes.","completion":"One of the most effective scratch removers available on the market is Bar Keepers Friend, which is a non-abrasive powder cleanser that can effectively eliminate deep scratches without causing additional damage to the surface of your stainless steel sink. The first step in using a scratch remover is to thoroughly clean the sink, ensuring there is no debris, dirt, or grease that may interfere with the scratch removal process. After cleaning, dampen a soft cloth or sponge with warm water and apply a small amount of Bar Keepers Friend to the cloth or sponge. Next, gently rub the scratch remover over the affected area, following the natural grain of the stainless steel, which is typically a straight or slightly curved line pattern. Avoid using circular or back-and-forth motions, as this may cause further scratching or create an inconsistent appearance on the surface. Apply moderate pressure as you rub the scratch remover to ensure that it penetrates the surface and effectively removes the scratch. Once you have covered the entire scratched area, carefully rinse the sink with warm water to remove any residual scratch remover. It is important not to let the scratch remover sit for too long on the surface, as it may cause discoloration or staining if not promptly rinsed away. After rinsing, thoroughly dry the sink with a clean, soft cloth to prevent water spots or streaks. Finally, examine the sink closely to ensure that the scratches have been removed or significantly diminished in appearance. If scratches remain, you may need to repeat the process, but be sure to exercise caution and avoid overdoing it, as excessive rubbing can cause damage to stainless steel. It is also worth investing in a quality sink protector to prevent future scratches on the sink. This protective layer can not only save you from the hassle of having to remove scratches frequently but also keep your stainless steel sink looking polished and new for a longer time. In conclusion, removing scratches from a stainless steel sink can be accomplished by using a scratch remover like Bar Keepers Friend and following the proper procedure for cleaning, rubbing, rinsing, and drying the sink. By showing patience and dedication during the process, your stainless steel sink can be restored to its original shine and remain free from unsightly scratches, allowing it to maintain a sophisticated and clean appearance in your kitchen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference , and the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress rings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray.

Answer the following question: Information: - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Mexica (Nahuatl: \\"Mxihcah\\", ; the singular is \\"Mxihcatl\\" ) or Mexicas were an indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico, known today as the rulers of the Aztec Empire. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - \`\` Freakshow '' is a single by the British band The Cure which was released on 13 June 2008 on Geffen Records in the United Kingdom .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? What she did was know this theory. Pick your answer from: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","completion":"1). Unacceptable Understanding the phrase \\"What she did was know this theory\\" requires a dissection of its grammatical components and an analysis of how these parts function together within standard English usage. To start, let's look at the verb 'know'. The verb 'know' is not an action verb; instead, it falls into a category labeled as stative verbs. These verbs represent a state or condition, such as to be, to seem, to understand, and in this case, to know. Stative verbs fundamentally describe situations that are steady and don't involve discernible movement; therefore, they do not typically function well in the past tense when describing a singular, specific event. Still, the main issue with the sentence in question is the phrase \\"What she did was.\\" This is a common euphemistic phrase used in English to emphasize the unexpectedness or impact of an action. It is typically followed by an action verb in the base form to provide a linguistic 'punch'. For instance, \\"What she did was break the window.\\" Here, 'break' is an action verb that denotes a specific, singular action in the past. The action is completed and, importantly, palpable/observable. However, in your sentence, that isn't the case. Using \\"know\\" doesn't fit because knowing is not a one-time perceptible action. It is a continuous state, a possession of knowledge ongoing over time that isn't bound to a specific moment. Thus, even if 'know' can be used in past tense, as in \\"She knew the theory,\\" in the specific context of \\"What she did was ...\\" it is not applicable. So, from a strictly linguistic perspective, even though informal or conversational English might render the original sentence understandable, it is not correct. Specifically, traditional grammarians and linguists would likely judge it as 'unacceptable' due to the misuse of a stative verb as an action verb and its awkward application after the phrase \\"What she did was...\\" More suitable suggestions for the sentence could be: \\"What she did was master this theory.\\" \\"What she did was apply this theory.\\" \\"What she did was learn this theory.\\" Each of these alternatives conveys a specific and observable action, thus aligning more accurately with traditional rules and expectations concerning English grammar structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Question: suppose more wax is softened happens, how will it affect a LARGER hive. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More effect. When more wax is softened, this will result in a larger hive, as the softened wax allows for an increased rate of construction and expansion. As more chewed up wax is available, worker bees can continue chewing and softening wax from within at a faster pace, which contributes to the growth of the hive. The second effect mentioned pertains to the honeycomb cells being used to house nectar, honey, and pollen. With a larger hive and an increased amount of softened wax, there will be more honeycomb cells available. Consequently, this will lead to a greater storage capacity for the bees to store nectar, honey, and pollen. The increased storage space will, in turn, benefit the overall functioning and sustenance of the bee colony, as they will have more resources to use for food, growth, and reproduction. So, the supposed perturbation of having more softened wax will have a more significant effect on both the hive size and the storage capacity for nectar, honey, and pollen within the honeycomb's cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Which fleet was given new orders to recapture Gotland?, using the article: Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position.

Here are some of the findings of a survey about hopes and dreams,and thousands of students across China took part in it. _ We received several different answers to the question:What would you like to do after finishing your education? It seems some students would like to start work as soon as possible, so that they can help provide better lives for their parents. Other students hope to continue studying after finishing school and to go to university. Although money is important, many teenagers said they want to do jobs they enjoy. According to the survey, the most popular choice of job is computer programming. _ Teenagers have all kinds of dreams. Some are more realistic than others. For example, many students said they would like to be volunteers if Beijing could hold the World Cup, maybe working as translators or tour guides. And quite a few said they dream of going to the moon one day. According to the survey, less realistic dreams are also common, but many students reported that they were willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.

Gradually, though, with the help of art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Andrea adjusts to the position and its many perks, including free designer clothing and other choice accessories. She begins to dress more stylishly and do her job competently, fulfilling a seemingly impossible request of Miranda's to get two copies of an unpublished Harry Potter manuscript to her daughters.She also comes to prize chance encounters with attractive young writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), who helped her obtain the Potter manuscript and suggests he could help her with her career.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Lupin Mine has a longer history than the Thompson-Lundmark Mine. The Lupin Mine, located in Nunavut, Canada, began its operations in 1982. The mine was initially owned by Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and primarily produced gold during its operational years. In 2005, the mine ceased production due to high operating costs and low gold prices, but it maintains a long and rich history within the Canadian mining industry. On the other hand, the Thompson-Lundmark Mine project, located in the Northwest Territories of Canada, is a gold deposit that was discovered in the 1950s. However, its development into a functional mine took longer, and it remained just a deposit for many years. As a result, the mine does not have as long a history as the Lupin Mine. Although both mines are located in Canada and have contributed to the country's gold reserves, Lupin Mine's earlier operational start and longer production period make it the mine with the longer history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: In Life Sciences it is important to note that whenever a structure has an increased surface area, there is an increase in the functioning of that structure. When someone gets bigger what happens to their body functions increases or decreases? Answer:","completion":"In life sciences, an increase in surface area generally leads to an increase in the functioning of a structure. However, when an organism or a person gets bigger, the relationship between their surface area and volume plays a significant role in determining how their body functions may change. As an organism grows, its volume increases at a faster rate than its surface area. This is due to the fact that volume increases by the cube of the growth factor, while surface area increases by the square of the growth factor. As a result, the surface area to volume ratio decreases as the organism gets bigger. This ratio has implications for several body functions including heat exchange, nutrient absorption, and waste removal, among others. When someone gets bigger, certain body functions may experience the following changes: 1. Heat exchange: A smaller surface area relative to volume makes it harder for organisms to dissipate heat through their surface, leading to a potential overheating risk. For larger organisms, specialized cooling mechanisms (such as sweating in humans) are needed to maintain adequate temperature regulation. 2. Nutrient absorption and waste removal: As organisms grow and the surface area to volume ratio decreases, the efficiency of nutrient absorption and waste removal may be compromised due to a larger volume of cells and slower exchange of materials through the surface. However, larger organisms usually develop specialized circulatory systems to compensate for this decrease in efficiency. 3. Metabolic rate: A smaller surface area to volume ratio in larger organisms often results in a lower metabolic rate per unit of body mass. This is because metabolic processes generate heat, and a smaller surface area relative to volume makes it more challenging to dissipate that heat, leading to the need for a reduced metabolic rate to prevent overheating. 4. Load-bearing structures: As organisms become bigger, their load-bearing structures, such as bones and muscles, must increase in size and strength to support the increased body mass. This can lead to adaptations in their locomotion and posture. In summary, when someone gets bigger, the relationship between surface area and volume becomes more disproportionate, which can lead to changes in body functions. Some body functions may decrease in efficiency, while others may require adaptations or specialized mechanisms to accommodate the increased size. The overall impact on their body functions depends on the degree of growth and the organism's ability to adapt to these changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The course description asks, \\"How can we be sure that we're not mistaken about everything? What kinds of things can we know for sure? What is knowledge anyway?\\" 2. Restorative Art I. University of the District of Columbia. This course, offered within UDC's Mortuary Science program, teaches students a lesson from the \\"Six Feet Under\\" playbook. Description: \\"An introduction to the physiognomy, surface bones of the cranium and face, modeling techniques, head shapes, facial profiles, structures of the ear, nose, mouth, and eyes.\\" 3. Banned and Dangerous Art. University of Mary Washington. This freshman seminar examines banned music, dangerous poets and degenerate art. 4. Ancient Egypt: Sex/Drugs/Rock. Johns Hopkins University. This seminar \\"explores sexuality and the role played by mood altering substances in the Egyptian New Kingdom.\\" 5. Sustainable Living: Raising Chickens at Home. Anne Arundel Community College. Here is the description for this noncredit course: \\"Enjoy farm fresh eggs from your backyard. Learn about zoning requirements, breed selection, chicken coop design, caring for chicks and general health maintenance.\\" 6. Field School in Material Culture. College of William and Mary. In this cryptically named elective course, students at the largely smoke-free college plant, grow and harvest tobacco as a matter of Virginia history. 7. Philosophy and Time Travel. University of Maryland. Students in this summer course study the paradoxes of travel through time but are not permitted to fast-forward to fall. 8. The Male Experience. Frostburg State University. \\"Examination from a gender-sensitive perspective of factors affecting the development of male behavior in American society.\\" An easy A for dudes?

I'm not saying that everything that comes out of the academy is worthy -- no doubt, there's a lot of junk. But, how can you tell if a line of research is stupid without becoming familiar with it? Reading a few course catalogs is not enough to do that.

He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915-1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922-1923), University of Wyoming (1924-1926), Haskell Institute--now Haskell Indian Nations University (1929-1932), and Albright College (1937-1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz was the head coach of the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11-11-2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Historian Linda M. Waggoner has traced Dietz' heritage in several articles in Indian Country Today Media Network and at a 2013 symposium at the National Museum of the American Indian. According to census records and to his birth certificate, he was born William Henry Dietz, or \\"Willie,\\" on August 17, 1884, in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, at 16 West Humbird Street. His father William Wallace Dietz, settled in the area in 1871 and was elected county sheriff in 1877. He married Leanna Ginder in November 1879. \\"Willie\\" attended Oklahoma's Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, where it is likely he feigned some kind of Indian identity for the first time. As Waggoner wrote, \\"Naturally, visitors to the St. Louis World's Fair exhibit, including Dietz's future wife, Winnebago artist Angel De Cora (1871-1919), thought Dietz was a Chilocco student.\\" In 1921, Dietz took a coaching position with Purdue University in Indiana. After Angel De Cora died in 1919, he married Doris O. Pottlitzer, a middle-aged local journalist, on January 29, 1922. The week previous to their marriage, Purdue officials fired him for illegal recruiting. In spring 1933, George Preston Marshall, owner of the Boston Braves, hired Dietz to replace Coach Lud Wray. In 1937, the team moved to Washington, D.C. For the rest of his life, Dietz continued to promote himself as Lone Star Dietz, the son of W.W. and Julia One Star of Pine Ridge. He took on his last coaching job in 1937 for Albright College in Pennsylvania; in 1964, still married to Doris, Dietz died in Reading, Pennsylvania. He and Doris were so poor that former teammates purchased his headstone.

Sentence 2: Of the twelve stories included, six were previously published in the author's first collection, \\"The Evening News\\". Step 2: The differences between the sentences are as follows: - Sentence 1 includes \\"that are\\" between \\"twelve stories\\" and \\"included,\\" whereas sentence 2 omits it. - Sentence 1 uses \\"evening news\\" as the title of the author's first collection, whereas sentence 2 uses \\"The Evening News.\\" Step 3: The overall meaning of both sentences is largely the same - they both state that out of twelve stories, six have been published in the author's first collection, and the respective titles of the collections mentioned are similar. However, there are some differences: - The grammatical structure of sentence 2 is more concise, as it omits \\"that are,\\" but this does not change the intended meaning. - The capitalization and addition of \\"The\\" in the title of sentence 2 could slightly change the interpretation of the titles, as \\"evening news\\" and \\"The Evening News\\" may refer to different works if the author had multiple works with similar titles.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who sells her ticket to a fellow passenger? Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery. Martha slips away and heads for the exit, where she reunites with Laurence, who was looking for the pair. He invites her back to his flat and she accepts.

Despite their efforts and brief moments of hope, the R's could not turn the tide in their favor, highlighting the necessity for some urgent changes. Step 2: Discuss Charlie Austin's role in the match and how his performance positively contributed. Amongst the setbacks, one ray of hope for QPR fans came in the form of striker Charlie Austin, who managed to get on the scoresheet with a well-converted penalty in the latter stages of the game. Austin has been undeniably crucial to the team's attack, often shouldering responsibilities and delivering goals that have boosted QPR's chances in various fixtures throughout the season. Step 3: Present Bobby Zamora's opinion that Charlie Austin should be given a new contract with the club. Veteran striker Bobby Zamora has voiced his support for Austin, urging QPR to provide the goal-machine with a new contract in order to secure his services for the foreseeable future.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \\"flashing\\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \\"graphitized\\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was not a problem for early carbon filaments?","completion":"One issue that was not a problem for early carbon filaments in light bulbs was the scarcity or high cost of the materials used.

Allen decided to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, finishing the rest of the album in two weeks. Allen's debut album, Alright, Still, was released in July 2006. Most of the tracks had been previewed on her MySpace page, including the singles \\"Smile\\", \\"LDN\\", \\"Knock 'Em Out\\", and \\"Alfie\\". In September 2006, \\"Smile\\" was made available on the US version of iTunes Store. By December 2006, her music video for Smile had been played on various music channels as well as the song getting a little airplay. Entertainment Weekly named Alright, Still as one of the top 10 albums of 2006 despite the fact that it had not yet been released in the US. Allen also did several promotional ads for MTV as their Discover and Download artist of the month for January 2007. The album was released in the US on 30 January 2007, landing at 20 on the Billboard 200. By January 2009, the album had sold 960,000 copies in the UK and 520,000 copies in the US. In 2007, she played the newly launched Park Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, replacing MIA who had cancelled. During the festival she reunited two members of The Specials, an act that guitarist Lynval Golding claimed played a \\"massive part\\" in the group's 2009 reunion. She also sang the vocals on the top ten single, \\"Oh My God\\", a cover of the Kaiser Chiefs song by Mark Ronson. On 1 July 2007, Allen appeared at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana. She sang \\"LDN\\" and \\"Smile\\". Allen's single \\"Littlest Things\\" from her album produced by Ronson, helped earn him a \\"Producer of the Year - Non Classical\\" 2008 Grammy Award. She also provided background vocals to a couple of songs on the Kaiser Chiefs' third album in 2008. Allen won a 2008 BMI songwriting award for \\"Smile\\". Allen signed a one series contract to present her own BBC Three TV show titled Lily Allen and Friends based on the social networking phenomenon that helped to launch her music career. Guests included Mark Ronson, Joanna Page, James Corden, Lauren Laverne, Roisin Murphy, Louis Walsh, and Danny Dyer. The show attracted only 2 per cent of the total multi-channel audience despite a high-profile nationwide marketing campaign. Citing Allen's rapid development as a TV host and her popularity among its target audience BBC Three announced it was renewing Lily Allen and Friends for a second season. BBC Three controller Danny Cohen later said that the show would not air in the Spring of 2009 as originally scheduled because of music commitments. Allen performed at a benefit concert for War Child, an international child protection agency that works with children affected by war. Backed by Keane, Allen sang \\"Smile\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing\\". Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?

A forward, he played for several clubs including Liverpool and Hamburger SV. He went on to manage Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City, winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs. He also managed the England national team. After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. He led the team to a winning start with 3-1 victory over Poland to reignite England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, and they entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2-0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts). After an initial popular period as manager, he began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3-2 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2-0 lead after 17 minutes. A 1-0 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, cost their opposition (the defending champions) progression to the quarter-finals, but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3-2, this time after taking a 2-1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over. Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000, after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium, before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager - although unlike Don Revie (1974-1977) or Steve McClaren (2006-2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England. When Sven-Goran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old. Keegan went on, \\"I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr Eriksson was and I'm delighted for him because that's the way it should be.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did he get the position with England?","completion":"As mentioned earlier, Kevin Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999.

Article: Scientist Marcus Eriksen stood ankle deep in the murky Los Angeles River on Friday and dipped a net into the water, looking for a problem. Eriksen was searching for \\"microbeads,\\" bits of plastic no bigger than salt grains that absorb toxins such as motor oil and insecticides as they tumble downstream and into the Pacific Ocean. The tiny polyethylene and polypropylene beads are an emerging concern among scientists and environmentalists. The beads come mostly from personal care products such as facial exfoliants and body washes. They are not biodegradable, however, and because they are not removed easily by wastewater treatment plants, they flow out to sea and enter the food chain. \\"Microplastic is now a ubiquitous contaminant in the Pacific Ocean — and seas around the world,\\" said Eriksen, a scientist with the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to researching plastics in the world's waterways. \\"We believe that 80% of it comes from coastal watersheds like Los Angeles.\\" Eriksen is just starting to test the Los Angeles River to determine if it holds microbeads, and if so, their source. On Friday, he found what he was looking for in about 10 minutes. Near the confluence of the river and Arroyo Seco, about three miles north of downtown, Eriksen found a handful of algae and wriggling leeches speckled with tiny filaments, shards and beads that could have come from myriad sources: laundry wastewater, degraded plastic bags, stir sticks, personal care products. \\"The scary thing is that the beads sponge up toxins, then get consumed by organisms from shellfish to crabs to fish\\" later eaten by humans, he said. Scientists are only beginning to understand the hazards posed by microplastic pollution in the world's oceans and inland waterways. In 2012, Eriksen and a team of researchers discovered large amounts of microbeads and other microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes. Those findings prompted a coalition of mayors of Great Lakes cities to ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to determine the possible health risks to lake ecosystems and humans. A year later, 5 Gyres launched a campaign asking the manufacturers of personal care products to remove plastic microbeads and replace them with nonplastic alternatives such as crushed walnut husks and apricot kernels that will degrade naturally. Several companies have agreed to phase microbeads out of their product lines. In a statement, the Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, for example, said it has \\"stopped developing new products containing polyethylene microbeads.\\" The company expects by 2015 to have replaced microbeads with alternatives in half the products that currently use them. That's not soon enough for 5 Gyres, which is circulating a petition titled, \\"Get plastic off my face and out of my water now!\\" Standing in the river, Eriksen demonstrated the problem. He squeezed several drops of Johnson & Johnson's Clean and Clear facial scrub into a small jar full of water, then shook it up and filtered the foamy mixture through a black T-shirt. Left behind on the fabric were hundreds of tiny white, pink and blue plastic beads. \\"We estimate there are about 330,000 microbeads per tube,\\" he said. The source of beads washing down the L.A. River isn't known yet. In rainy weather, the river holds vast amounts of runoff from across the region. But in the current drought, 80% of the flow comes from the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, which sits 12 miles upstream from Eriksen's survey site and treats sewage from the homes of 800,000 San Fernando Valley residents. The other 20% is from myriad sources in the area. Jimmy Tokeshi, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, suggested it's not coming from the plant, which sends sewage through a series of holding tanks, digesters, filters and sanitizers before discharging the treated water into the river at a rate up to 27 million gallons a day. \\"The city of L.A. meets and/or exceeds all Clean Water Act requirements as well as all local, county and state water regulations,\\" Tokeshi said. Using cloth filters, \\"We capture microplastics that are larger in size than 10 microns, or 0.01 millimeters, in the water reclamation plant,\\" he said. Most of the visible plastic debris Eriksen found was much larger than 10 microns in size. Eriksen said he doesn't yet know the origin of the beads. But he said his nets don't lie. \\"Using a net only 2 feet wide for 10 minutes in a stream a few hundred feet across, I caught dozens of bits of plastic,\\" he said. \\"So, it's easy to extrapolate that millions of plastic particles flow through this channel every day.\\" He pivoted to face downstream, and with a wave of his muddy hands, he declared: \\"That's a problem.\\" louis.sahagun@latimes.com ||||| ALBANY – Tiny microbeads used as abrasives in everything from skin care products to toothpaste, which scientists say are polluting Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes, would be banned under legislation being proposed by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Scientists have warned that the plastic pollutants, which has shown up in studies of Lake Erie, can last for centuries. Schneiderman called his plan “common-sense legislation” that will reduce the flow of the tiny plastic particles into key waterways of New York. It would be the nation’s first such legislation calling for a ban of the particles now used in more than 100 consumer products. The Microbead-Free Waters Act would ban the distribution, sale or manufacture in New York of beauty and other personal care products that contain plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size. The legislation comes after a group that represents the interests of more than 100 cities in the United States and Canada along the Great Lakes urged federal officials in the two nations to crack down on the use of the tiny plastic particles in consumer products. They cited a State University of New York at Fredonia study that found the plastic particles in three Great Lakes, with the highest concentration in Lake Erie. Scientists say there are other non-toxic particles companies can use in their products besides the plastic microbeads, some of which are so small they can only been seen under a microscope. Environmental groups say the products get into waterways from the pipes in consumers’ homes are often not caught by public sewage plants and are a threat to drinking water and fish stocks. Dave Ullrich, executive director of the Chicago-based Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which represents 111 Great Lakes cities, including Niagara Falls, said the water in the lakes turns over relatively slowly. The water now in Lake Erie takes about five years to totally replace itself with new water, while Lake Superior can take 200 years. As a result, the microbeads his group is trying to get banned tend to accumulate in the Great Lakes more than other waterways. “Any action of this nature that can make the right thing happen, namely to prevent new products and getting them out of the system as quickly as possible, is a good thing,’’ Ullrich said in an interview. He noted his group has written to the 11 companies that use microbeads and have gotten responses from six of them with varying levels of commitments. Ullrich said other states are considering bans, though he believes New York is the first with actual proposed legislation. Schneiderman’s office said three manufacturers – Proctor and Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive – have recently agreed to phase out using microbeads in their consumer products. They said products containing the terms “polyethylene’’ or “polypropylene” on their ingredient list are those with microbeads. email: tprecious@buffnews.com ||||| Right now 86 NGOs from 37 countries are supporting the campaign! Already 446 brands from 117 different manufacturers promised to remove plastic microbeads from their products. To achieve a microbead free environment, we need your support. Any gift will help! ||||| Lawmakers in Albany could make New York the first state to outlaw the tiny plastic beads used in personal care products like facial scrubs and toothpastes. Legislation that is scheduled to be introduced on Tuesday by Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney of Suffolk County on behalf of Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman would prohibit the sale of cosmetic and beauty products that contain the beads, which are added to aid exfoliation and abrasion. The beads appear in the tens of millions in the Great Lakes, according to scientists’ estimates, with high concentrations along the New York shores of Lake Erie. They become coated with toxins like PCBs and can be eaten by fish and other marine life. Scientists suggest that those toxins could be working their way back up the food chain to humans. The beads and other bits of tiny “microplastic” debris slip through wastewater treatment plants and have also been found in the Los Angeles River and in the Pacific Ocean. Antipollution activists argue that limiting the use of cosmetics, which can have hundreds of thousands of beads in a bottle, can help limit the environmental risk. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Scientist Marcus Eriksen has expressed his concerns over the presence of microbeads in water systems, especially in coastal watersheds like Los Angeles.

In the end, we have another -241 groups of 'k' blocks (it means someone wants to take these groups back) Now we're going to solve it step by step: Step 1: Combine the number of blocks that mommy took away: 83308 - 22964 = 60344 So now we have: 1347 * k + 60344 = -241 * k Step 2: Bring the -241 * k blocks from the right side to the left side by adding 241 * k to both sides: 1347 * k + 241 * k + 60344 = 0 Step 3: Now let's combine the groups of k blocks: (1347 + 241) * k + 60344 = 0 1588 * k + 60344 = 0 Step 4: We have to get 'k' alone or by itself, so let's take 60344 blocks away from the left side: 1588 * k = -60344 Step 5: Finally, divide the -60344 blocks by the 1588 groups to find out how many blocks are in each group (which is 'k'): k = -60344 / 1588 k = -38 The magical number 'k' we were looking for is -38! So if we give back 38 blocks for every group, the equation will be balanced!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Duma, which is Russia's lower house of parliament, is advocating that it is high time for Russia to assist Serbia in tackling the economic and political challenges caused by these sanctions. In response to the Duma's call for action, various political and economic experts have voiced their opinions and highlighted the potential implications of Russia's intervention. Background of Belgrade Sanctions: The sanctions against Belgrade date back to the 1990s when the United Nations Security Council introduced measures to curtail the ongoing conflicts caused by the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Although there have been amendments in recent years, the lingering effects of these sanctions continue to hinder Serbia's growth and development. The UN sanctions primarily focused on imposing restrictions on weapons supplies, travel, and finances. Consequently, Belgrade has been grappling with economic setbacks and mounting political pressures while trying to foster diplomacy with the international community. Russia's Role in Supporting Belgrade: Russia and Serbia have shared a historical bond, marked by strong political, cultural, and economic ties. Over the years, Moscow has been a prominent ally of Belgrade and has stepped in on numerous occasions to veto UN resolutions that might further harm Serbia's interests. Russia's support for Serbia has primarily stemmed from their shared Slavic and Orthodox Christian heritage, which has been a driving force in fostering closer relations between the two nations. Benefits of Lifting Sanctions: Lifting the sanctions against Belgrade will undoubtedly pave the way for tremendous growth opportunities for Serbia. With the imposition of these measures gone, Serbia will be able to regain its financial footing and elevate its living standards. The nation's infrastructure will have the chance to prosper, and Serbia will ultimately gain the ability to establish stronger global ties. Moreover, the lifting of sanctions will enable Serbia to reintegrate into the international community and be seen as an active player in fostering global peace and stability. This will lead to increased foreign investments and robust economic growth, gradually transforming the country's development landscape. Potential Implications of Russia's Intervention: While the Russian Duma's call for intervention is viewed positively by many in Serbia, critics argue that Russia's active role may spark concerns amongst Serbia's western neighbors. Moscow's interference can be interpreted as a strategic move to expand its influence in the Balkan region. Additionally, Russia's support for Serbia might exacerbate tensions with countries that are part of the EU or those that have expressed their desire to join the bloc. The situation could lead to a more significant rift in an already fragile region, causing obstacles for future political and economic collaborations. Conclusion: The appeal by the Russian Duma to help Belgrade lift the sanctions represents an opportunity for Serbia to reclaim its standing in the international community. However, it is imperative to weigh the potential consequences of Russia's intervention on regional stability. An effective and diplomatic approach that takes into account the interests of all parties involved would be the most beneficial path to forge better relationships and improve Serbia's political and economic prospects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Snout-nosed crocodiles with jaws strong enough to crush clam shells ruled the swampy wetlands that covered Peru 13 million years ago. Palaeontologists have discovered the remains of seven different species of crocodile and cayman, including three new species, in the area around the modern Amazon river. The fossils were found in the Pebas district of northern Peru. The new species of caymen Gnatusuchus pebasensis (shown in the reconstruction above) had a short but wide jaw that was powerful enough to crush clams and other shell fish. It used its snout to dig in the mud. One of the new species, named Gnatusuchus pebasensis, had blunt, peg-like teeth and used its broad snout to dig shellfish from the muddy swamp floor. It grew up to 5.2ft (1.6 metres) in length and had just 11 teeth. Most cayman, which are related to alligators, tend to have around 20 teeth. Prehistoric crocodiles escaped the jaws of predatory dinosaurs by running like dogs, according to a study published last year. The findings explain how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. While most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. After the devastating extinction that ended the Triassic period, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour. Another blunt nosed crocodile was named Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis, which means 'grinding or crushing machine'. The scientists estimate it grew up to 6.2ft (1.9 metres) in length. However, these new species were dwarved by two other previously known species of giant cayman whose fossils were also found nearby. Purussaurus neivensis and Mourasuchus atopus are thought to have grown up to 39ft (12 metres) in length and were more generalised predators. The researchers say that it is highly unusual to have found a habitat that had so many species of cayman living alongside each other. There are six cayman species that live in the whole of the Amazon basin today, but only three are ever found in the same area and they rarely share the same habitat. The large number of cayman found in Pebas has been described by the researchers leading the excavation as 'hyperdiverse'. Dr Rodolfo Salas Gismondi, from the University of Montpelier in France, said the huge wetland habitat that covered the area led to an explosion in the number of crocodile species. He said: 'We have uncovered this special momen in time when the ancient mega-wetaland ecosystem reached its peak in size and complexity, just before its demise and the start of the modern Amazon River system. 'At this moment, most known cayman groups co-existed. 'Ancient lineages bearing unusual blunt snouts and globular teeth along with those more generalised feeders representing the beginning of what was to come.' The fossils may now help scientists unravel the evolutionary origins of cayman that live in the Amazon basin. They describe the discovery in a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Scientists found fossilised remains of seven ancient caymen species in Pebas, northern Peru, shown above. The fossilised skulls shown above belong to the three new snout nosed caymen species Gnatusuchus pebasensis (a) Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis (b) and the much larger Caiman wannlangstoni (c) The Gnatusuchus pebasensis name is derived from 'Natu', which is Quechua for 'small nose', along with the name of the village where it was found, Pebas, and the Greek for crocodile - Souchos. The animal, which is new to science, is thought to have used its snout as a shovel in to search for shellfish in the muddy depths of the swamps. Dr Salas Gismondi said: 'When we analysed Gnatusuchus bones and realised that it was probably a head-burrowing and shovelling caiman preying on mollusks living in muddy river and swamp bottoms, we knew it was a milestone for understanding proto-Amazonian wetland feeding dynamics.' The scientists also describe a third new species of prehistoric caymen called Caiman wannlangstoni, which they estimate grew up to 7ft (2.2 metres) long. It is thought to have resembled the broad-snouted caymen that lives in fresh water marshes and swamps thought out central and eastern south America. Caiman wannlangstoni, one of the new species, resembled the broad snouted caymen pictured above.

Much of Britain basked in glorious sunshine over the weekend, despite trees and plants showing signs of the next season. Thousands took to parks, rivers and woodland to enjoy the first of the stunning autumnal colours while the sun was still shining. A woman strolls past the red and gold-leaved trees in Westonbirt Arboretum, Gloucestershire, on the first day of autumn today. Walkers enjoyed the changing landscape today on the Autumn equinox. Despite the change in colours, forecasters say the weather is unseasonably warm. Forecasters say temperatures are up to 6C higher than expected in September.

I was driving through the New Forest and the light began to drop and I just had to go and take a picture of the stunning heather. 'The heather is in full colour and the leaves and grass is starting to turn a golden brown- mix that with the sunset and it's one of the greatest places to sit back and relax.' However, summer is not quite over yet. The Met Office say temperatures will be unseasonably warm tomorrow.

Please answer the following question: Article: Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first major American movie, Roman Holiday, which was showed in 1953. But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer.

Ready for launch: video game programmer Richard Garriott shown in training for his space flight in October. Aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich, there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift-off. To gain a better insight into this training, well-known video game programmer and designer Richard Garriott, who is preparing for his own space adventure in October, is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler. Garriott has been in training since the beginning of the year and told CNN the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations. \\"When I first came here in January, I thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time. Of course, very quickly, I realized that I had signed up for a very complex task, something much more difficult that I had anticipated. I immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight. \\"And now that I am so close to the flight, I am still feeling the pressure, I definitively have been working very long days and most nights,\\" Garriott said. The training regime has three major strands: physical training, which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment; practical training for day-to-day living in space; and like any flight, be it 10 minutes or 10 days, training in safety procedures for emergency situations. Trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off-site to complete the requirements, which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet. Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, the company sending Garriott into space, told CNN the training program is extensive, but does not exclude people from making the flight. \\"Their total training program is a few months, but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives. They are not training to the same degree as the professionals.\\" As long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health, they can usually go ahead with their adventure, he said. \\"There's some fitness involved. There are certainly [medical] things that are not allowable in space, but they are generally more serious conditions.\\" He said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in \\"Gs.\\" \\"The body is designed to live on one 'G,' so when you expose it to higher 'Gs' it has an effect. With the training and given the [short] length of the visits there's a minimal effect on the body.\\" In his blog on the training process, Garriott said one part of the training was indisputably the worst. \\"Hardest of all was the 'Spinning Chair of Ultimate Sickness.' I can't imagine that I will ever again voluntarily sit in a device designed to make you sick, or ride it as long as I can. Ugh, this is definitely my least favorite part of training!\\" Despite such disturbing preparations, Anderson said much of the training, which takes place at Space Adventures' base in Star City, Russia, is centered upon general living in space. \\"There's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat, how to drink, and how to use the restroom, for example,\\" he said. \\"There's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment.\\" Garriott said many of the procedures for living in space, or for emergencies, are very complex. \\"There are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms, plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction; the toilet (everybody's favorite piece of space trivia!), including powering up the can for suction and waste removal; and lastly, onboard water sources.\\" He admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by \\"cramming like any good college kid.\\" And the most fascinating part of the training? In Garriott's opinion, it was running in a hypobaric chamber, where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters (about 2,000 meters higher than Mount Everest). \\"I felt no physical or mental problems, but I did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe. Basically, it was possible to make a tennis ball-sized pocket in my mouth, but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum! \\"By that I mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed,\\" he said. \\"However, at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch! Weird.\\" It truly is.","completion":"Space travel might seem exciting, but it's not as simple as people think. First, it's expensive, so only very rich people can go.

He has been training since January and was surprised by how intense the preparations were. His training includes physical training to get used to space environment, day-to-day living skills in space, and safety procedures for emergencies.

Title: Resident Evil: Apocalypse Movie plot: A month after the contamination of The Hive seen in Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation unwisely sends in a research team to reopen the complex and investigate the incident, since no one survived except Alice and Matt Addison, and as Alice was experimented on, Matt was put into a mysterious \\"Nemesis Program\\". When the team reprograms and opens the sealed blast doors, they are slaughtered by the massive crowd of infected. With the infected released outside, they reach Raccoon City, spreading the infection among the general populace. Two days after the infection has spread to the surface, Umbrella, worried about possible worldwide contamination, quarantines Raccoon City and establishes a security perimeter around it, also evacuating all important Umbrella personnel out of the city. However, a girl named Angela Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur), daughter of the Level 6 Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), who is also the T-virus creator, goes missing, after an Umbrella security car transporting her out of Raccoon City suffers a traffic accident. Alice awakens in the deserted Raccoon City hospital attached to wiring, and after strapping herself out of the wiring, she manages to unlock her room and step outside. Finding no one in the hospital, she wanders outside to find the city a ghost town, infected. She arms herself with a shotgun from a police car and wanders around the city to look for supplies. She is constantly disturbed by a man who keeps showing up in visions, who was revealed to be experimenting on her; she now has superhuman agility and strength. While Umbrella is evacuating civilians at the Raven's Gate Bridge, the only exit out of the town, disgraced police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), confers with Sargeant Payton Wells (Razaaq Adoti), her old ally, after hearing about the infection being true. However, the T-virus infects a man having a heart attack, turning him into a zombie that bites Payton at the city gates. Umbrella's supervisor and the head of the Raccoon City...

By area, which is the largest state in the USA?","completion":"The largest state in the United States by area is Alaska. Alaska is located in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south. With an area of 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers), Alaska is approximately twice the size of the next largest state, Texas, and more than twice the size of the third largest state, California. Alaska was purchased from the Russian Empire in 1867 for 7.2 million, a deal that became known as the \\"Alaska Purchase\\" or \\"Seward's Folly,\\" after U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, who negotiated the agreement. Alaska became the 49th state of the United States on January 3, 1959. Approximately one-third of Alaska lies within the Arctic Circle, which means that it experiences both extreme daylight and darkness during the summer and winter months, respectively. Due to its immense size, Alaska's climate, geography, and natural resources are incredibly diverse. The state boasts the highest mountain peak in North America, Denali (formerly Mt. McKinley), which stands at 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level. Moreover, Alaska is home to vast wilderness areas, expansive forests, numerous rivers, lakes, glaciers, and a rich array of wildlife. One striking feature of Alaska is its extensive coastline, which is not only the longest of any state in the United States but also longer than the combined coastlines of all the other states. Thanks to this coastline, Alaska boasts a robust fishing and seafood industry, which serves as one of the state's primary economic engines. While it holds the title of the largest state by area, Alaska has a relatively low population density. Most of its residents are concentrated in urban areas, such as Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau (the state capital), which are connected to the rest of the country and world by air and sea transportation. The state's vast and remote wilderness, as well as its harsh winters, create logistical and infrastructure challenges for the people who call Alaska home. Nevertheless, Alaskans have cultivated a reputation for their rugged individualism and close-knit communities, shaped by their unique and sometimes harsh environment. In conclusion, the largest state in the United States by area is Alaska, covering an impressive 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers). Alaska's diverse and dramatic landscape, encompassing towering mountains, vast forests, and an extensive coastline, reflects its immense size. Despite its enormous land area, low population density characterizes Alaska, with its residents primarily concentrated in urban centers. Alaska's unique environment and remote location have shaped its rich culture and way of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada for the following movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus.

Given the question: Process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person starts to hyperventilate happens, how will it affect more oxygen travels to the lungs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. When a person starts to hyperventilate, their breathing becomes rapid and shallow. This increases the rate at which oxygen enters the body and travels to the lungs. Let's break down the effects step-by-step: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: Hyperventilation causes more rapid and shallow breaths, resulting in more oxygen entering the body than during normal breathing. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: With increased breathing rate, more oxygen reaches the lungs in a shorter amount of time. However, shallow breaths may not allow for the most efficient gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): Because more oxygen is present in the blood due to hyperventilation, more oxygen binds to the hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: As the heart continues to pump blood throughout the body, it delivers these oxygen-rich erythrocytes to various tissues. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: With increased oxygen availability, cells may receive more oxygen than they would under normal breathing conditions. However, this can be offset by the potential decrease in gas exchange efficiency caused by the rapid and shallow breaths of hyperventilation. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that hyperventilation directly affects the process of oxygen entering the body, traveling to the lungs, and binding to hemoglobin in erythrocytes. This may lead to an increase in oxygen available for cells, but the actual impact depends on the balance between the increased oxygen intake and the efficiency of gas exchange during hyperventilation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Irwin was born on his mother's birthday to Lyn and Bob Irwin in Essendon, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. He was of Irish descent on his father's side. He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School. Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a wildlife rehabilitator. On 4 September 2006, Irwin was on location at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, taking part in the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television programme. While swimming in chest-deep water, Irwin approached a stingray with an approximate span of two metres (6.5 ft) from the rear, in order to film it swimming away. According to the incident's only witness, \\"All of a sudden [the stingray] propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail. Hundreds of strikes in a few seconds\\". Irwin initially believed he only had a punctured lung. However, the stingray's barb pierced his heart, causing him to bleed to death. The stingray's behaviour appeared to have been a defensive response to being boxed in. Crew members aboard Irwin's boat administered CPR and rushed him to the nearby Low Isles where medical staff pronounced him dead. Irwin's death is believed to be the only fatality from a stingray ever captured on video. Footage of the incident was viewed by Queensland state police as part of their mandatory investigations. All copies of the footage were then destroyed at the behest of Irwin's family. Production was completed on Ocean's Deadliest, which was broadcast in the US on the Discovery Channel on 21 January 2007. The documentary was completed with footage shot in the weeks following the accident, but without including any mention of Irwin's accidental death. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: was Steve under water when this happened?","completion":"Based on the quote from the article, \\"While swimming in chest-deep water, Irwin approached a stingray with an approximate span of two metres (6.5 ft) from the rear, in order to film it swimming away,\\" it can be inferred that Steve Irwin was not fully underwater when the incident happened. He was swimming in chest-deep water, which implies that his head was likely above the water surface while he was filming the stingray."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reason is that \\"How are you?\\" isn't really a question and \\"Fine\\" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi\\". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks \\"Do you agree?\\" the other person might think, \\"No, I disagree. I think you're wrong...\\" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say \\"I'm not sure.\\" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people.

Let's break down the elements of both the premise and hypothesis to understand why this is the case. Premise elements: 1. A little girl: The premise describes a single child, a little girl, as the main subject. Gender and age are also indicated in this description. 2. Bright pink pants: The little girl's attire is mentioned, specifically focusing on her bright pink pants. 3. Playfully: The girl's behavior is described as light-hearted and fun. 4. Sticks her face in a contraption: The girl's specific activity is depicted as placing her face in some type of contraption or structure. 5. On a playground: The setting of the scene is established as a playground. Hypothesis elements: 1. Playing dodgeball: The hypothesis suggests a specific game being played, which is dodgeball. 2. With her friends: The hypothesis implies the presence and involvement of the girl's friends. Comparing the elements of the premise with those of the hypothesis, the following observations are apparent: 1. Both the premise and hypothesis involve a little girl as the main subject. 2. The premise identifies the location as a playground, which could be consistent with the hypothesis, as dodgeball can be played on a playground. 3. The girl's attire and behavior in the premise (wearing bright pink pants and playing playfully) do not provide information about the type of game or activity she is engaged in. 4. The girl's actions in the premise (sticking her face in a contraption) do not correlate with the game of dodgeball described in the hypothesis. Dodgeball involves throwing and dodging balls, not sticking one's face into contraptions. The presence of a little girl on a playground, as described in the premise, is not enough to confirm that she is participating in a dodgeball game with her friends, as stated in the hypothesis. Furthermore, the girl's activity of sticking her face in a contraption does not align with the typical actions associated with playing dodgeball. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine if the hypothesis is true or not."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase.

Mr McKay said he accepted this was \\"inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong\\". The outgoing MLA for North Antrim also apologised for his actions.

The DUP believes the latest revelation shows there was a dirty tricks operation against Mr Robinson, who strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Now Mr McKay, once considered a party high-flyer, has submitted his resignation. The Stormont Finance Committee inquiry was set up last year due to political controversy over the multi-million pound sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property portfolio. It followed an allegation made in the Dáil (Irish parliament) that a politician or political party in Northern Ireland stood to profit from the loan sale. Last September, Mr Bryson used a meeting of the committee to name former DUP leader Peter Robinson as the individual he referred to as \\"Person A\\" in relation to the scandal. The then first minister of Northern Ireland strongly denied he had sought to benefit in any way from the multi-million pound property deal. It is now claimed that Sinn Féin's Mr McKay and Mr O'Hara advised Mr Bryson about his evidence before the hearing. Leaked social media messages obtained by the BBC's Nolan Show and The Irish News show that on 17 September 2015, Mr McKay sent a direct message to Mr Bryson, telling him to follow a Twitter account in the name of Thomas O'Hara, who is understood to be a fellow Sinn Féin member. The following day, a direct Twitter message from Mr O'Hara to Mr Bryson said: \\"You may only get 10-15 seconds on this before Daithi as chair has to pull you on it so squeeze your best points on this into 1-2 lines and come straight to the point.\\" Another message from him said: \\"Keep it short if you can, when it's said it's said and its privileged. Will be a great finisher.\\" In his resignation statement, Mr McKay said: \\"I want to be absolutely clear that my intention was not, as alleged, to coach the witness in question with regard to the substance of his testimony, but rather ensure that the inquiry had full access to the truth with regard to all the issues relating to the Nama scandal.\\" Shortly before Mr McKay's resignation on Thursday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness vehemently denied having any knowledge about the exchange. \\"Having spoken to all relevant personnel in the Assembly I am now entirely satisfied that Sinn Féin had no knowledge of any such contact.\\" But Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McGuinness's statement \\"lacked the ring of truth\\" and was not the end of the matter. The Alliance Party's deputy leader Naomi Long said: \\"This is something that an independent person is going to have to look into to restore some sort of public confidence.\\" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the \\"seriousness\\" of the claims \\"cannot and must not be underplayed\\". Mr Bryson told the BBC that allegations he had been coached by Sinn Féin before giving evidence were \\"absolute nonsense\\". \\"I can categorically state that the source of my information did not come from Sinn Féin,\\" the blogger said. He also denied leaking the information to the media. Summary:","completion":"Sinn Féin has suspended Daithi McKay, former member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for North Antrim, following allegations that he coached opposition activist and blogger Jamie Bryson before an appearance at a legislative committee. Bryson appeared prior to a Stormont inquiry into the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) last September and claimed that then First Minister Peter Robinson would make a profit from the sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property portfolio. Mr Robinson strenuously denied the allegations. Leaked private Twitter messages have revealed that Mr Bryson was in contact with Mr McKay and another Sinn Féin member about how to present his claims.

He breached poll laws by flashing his party's symbol and making a political speech while voting was going on in the seventh phase of the election, it said. Mr Modi addressed journalists and supporters after casting his vote in his home state of Gujarat. He later posted a \\"selfie\\" of his inked finger on Twitter. By Sanjoy MajumderBBC News, Ahmedabad As Mr Modi's convoy arrived at the polling station, it was greeted with frenzied celebrations. His supporters had taken up positions all along the street - young, old, women and even young children among them. There were others on the roofs of surrounding buildings, competing for space with security personnel and snipers deployed to protect the man whom most Gujaratis want to see installed as India's next PM. Chants of \\"Modi, Modi\\" split the air as he emerged from the polling station only to be swallowed up by a sea of people. He waved to the crowds, flashing a victory sign as his security detail fought hard to keep his supporters at bay. After a short exchange with the waiting media, which included several international teams, he was off leaving behind a trail of dust. His supporters, though, lingered on. \\"He's winning handsomely, you mark my word,\\" one of them said. \\"And once he becomes PM, he'll be in the post until he dies.\\" India's general election, with 814 million eligible voters, is the world's biggest exercise in democracy and the governing Congress party is battling the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for power. Mr Modi is ahead in all the opinion polls. He was greeted by cheering crowds lining the streets and on rooftops as he arrived at the polling station in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's biggest city. Voting was held in all 26 seats in the state. Andhra Pradesh also voted on Wednesday for the last time as a united state before it is divided on 2 June. Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh were among seven states and two union territories where 139 million eligible voters had to make their choice between some 1,300 candidates contesting 89 seats on Wednesday. \\"The BJP will form a stable government in Delhi soon,\\" Mr Modi said after casting his vote. \\"The Congress party has already conceded defeat... It is the end of the mother-son government,\\" he added, in a reference to the Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul. By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Modi's clever pitch in Gujarat But photographs of an upbeat Mr Modi holding a small white lotus flower, shown on television screens across India, have landed him in trouble with the Election Commission. The commission said it had seen the video recordings of Mr Modi's speech and that it was evident that it was \\"a political speech intended and calculated to influence and affect the result of elections in the constituencies voting today\\". It has now ordered the authorities to register a case against him. A spokesperson for the BJP said Mr Modi had done nothing wrong and that the party would respond to the Election Commission notice. If found guilty, Mr Modi could be sent to jail for up to two years or asked to pay a fine, or both, but correspondents say it is unlikely to happen. Mr Modi is standing for election in two seats - in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi as well as Vadodara in Gujarat. If he wins both seats, he will have to relinquish one. In Andhra Pradesh - where voting for state assemblies is also taking place - brisk polling was reported through the day.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps.

Given the background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. and the situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Answer the following question: Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two? A:","completion":"Battle day two would be a better day for group B to attack group A. Let me provide a detailed explanation. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory is 5°C. This temperature is significantly lower than the preferred range of 20–30 °C for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. At this temperature, the ants may not be constructing more openings in the nest thatch for temperature regulation because the temperature is already quite low. In fact, they might be closing openings in the nest thatch to conserve heat and maintain the optimal internal nest conditions. On battle day two, the temperature in group A's territory is 22°C. This falls within the preferred range of 20–30 °C for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. In these conditions, the workers of group A will likely make more openings in their nest thatch in order to regulate the internal nest temperature as it goes up. This will make their nest more susceptible to attacks from group B. On battle day three, group A's territory had low air humidity. In this case, the worker ants would tend to close the openings in the nest thatch to reduce water loss for the colony. This makes the nest less vulnerable to an attack. On battle day four, group A's territory had high air humidity. In this scenario, the ants might not necessarily make more or fewer openings in their nest thatch, as humidity is not directly related to their temperature regulation strategy. Given this information, battle day two would be the optimal day for group B to attack group A, as it is during this time that they will likely have more openings in their nest thatch due to the temperature falling within the preferred range of 20–30 °C. This will make the nest of group A more exposed and vulnerable, providing a strategic advantage for group B."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Is this product review positive?

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how fire extinguisher works Suggested answer: Some jurisdictions require more frequent service for fire extinguishers. Should I validate this answer?","completion":"The suggested answer doesn't adequately answer the question about how fire extinguishers work. Here's a more detailed and relevant answer: Fire extinguishers work by using a combination of suppressing agents to remove the essential elements of fire, typically referred to as the fire triangle. The fire triangle consists of heat, fuel, and oxygen. Removing any of these elements will extinguish the fire. There are different types of fire extinguishers designed to combat specific classes of fires: 1. Class A: These fires involve ordinary combustible materials like wood, paper, and cloth. Water or chemical foam extinguishers are commonly used to remove heat and cool down the burning materials. 2. Class B: These fires involve flammable liquids and gases like gasoline, oil, and propane. Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, and foam extinguishers are typically used to smother the fire, thus removing oxygen from the fire triangle. 3. Class C: These fires involve electrical equipment, such as electrical panels, wiring, and appliances. Non-conductive extinguishing agents like carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or halon-based agents are used so as not to harm the electrical equipment and to prevent re-ignition. 4. Class D: These fires involve flammable metals like magnesium, potassium, or sodium. A specialized extinguisher called a Class D extinguisher, which uses a dry powder agent, is used to smother and cool down the fire. 5. Class K: These fires typically involve cooking oils and greases found in commercial kitchen environments. Wet chemical extinguishers are designed to combat these types of fires by creating a foam-like barrier that cools and smothers the fire, preventing re-ignition. Regarding the maintenance of fire extinguishers, it is essential to perform regular inspections and servicing as required by local laws, regulations, and guidelines. These requirements may differ based on the jurisdiction, but a common recommendation is to have fire extinguishers inspected annually by a licensed professional and monthly visual inspections performed by a responsible person within the premises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As the overwhelming plague swept through the city, people sought refuge and hope in any way they could. Amidst this chaos, hospitals teemed with patients, some clutching onto their dear lives. Among them was Brett, who had contracted the disease in its early stages. He was admitted to the medical facility, shivering with chills and gasping for breath as the nurses hurried to his aid. Step 1: Establish the bond between Joseph and Brett While Brett's condition worsened at the hospital, Joseph, a skilled doctor, took notice of him. Empathizing with the suffering patient, Joseph resolved to do everything in his power to help Brett. As fate would have it, Joseph and Brett were both passionate about protecting wildlife. This shared interest paved the way for their friendship, fortifying Joseph's determination to save Brett's life. Step 2: Understand the disease and devise a treatment plan Acquiring a sample of the virus, Joseph delved into research, attempting to discern the nature of the disease and develop a cure. He studied the virus's genetic makeup, analyzed its symptoms and effects on the human body, and collaborated with fellow doctors and researchers to create a treatment plan. Step 3: Implement the treatment and monitor progress Administering a cocktail of experimental antiviral medications, Joseph closely observed Brett's reaction to the treatment. As days went by, there were moments of exhilaration as Brett's condition improved, followed by heart-wrenching setbacks as the plague's relentless grip grew stronger. Step 4: Adjust and refine the treatment plan With an unwavering spirit, Joseph tirelessly modified the treatment plan based on the successes and failures observed throughout Brett's recovery journey. He consulted with experts, attended seminars, and incorporated information gleaned from recoveries of other patients afflicted with the plague. Step 5: Evaluate the patient's response and celebrate the victory Finally, the arduous efforts bore fruit. The refined treatment strategy saw Brett's immune system rallying to defeat the virus. Witnessing Brett's breathing stabilize, his fever subside, and his strength return, Joseph exhaled in relief. The medical staff, who had followed Brett's journey closely, rejoiced at the miraculous recovery. Through Joseph's unrelenting determination and his willingness to exhaust every avenue of treatment, he successfully played a crucial role in preventing the disease from taking Brett's life. The bond they forged throughout the ordeal would forever be etched in their hearts, a testament to the incomparable power of compassion and human connection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Why did the person not really eat anything lately ?","completion":"The person has not really eaten anything lately primarily because of their illness, which is described in the text. From Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning, they experienced a high fever of around 102 degrees Fahrenheit and vomited anything that came into contact with their lips. This indicates that the primary reason for the person not eating is that their body was not able to keep food down due to their sickness. Option A, \\"They were unable to buy food,\\" may contribute to their inability to eat, but it is not mentioned in the passage provided. The main focus of the passage is on the person's illness and its effects. Option B, \\"They were sick,\\" is accurate since the passage clearly states that the person was ill with a fever and vomiting, which would lead to a reduced appetite and inability to keep food down. Option C, \\"They were broke on Monday,\\" is mentioned in the context of the kids' first day of school, but it is not directly related to the person's eating habits. Furthermore, the passage does not indicate that the person was unable to eat due to a lack of financial resources. Option D, \\"They were anorexic,\\" is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of the person experiencing disordered eating or having a fear of gaining weight. The person's lack of eating is attributed to their sickness and subsequent vomiting, rather than a mental health condition like anorexia. In conclusion, the primary reason why the person did not really eat anything lately is that they were sick, as indicated in the passage. Their illness resulted in a high fever and vomiting, which made it difficult for them to consume and retain food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Options are: A). negative B). positive).","completion":"A). Negative Movie Review: Title: Disappointment Unleashed – A Wasted Opportunity As a movie enthusiast, I have witnessed countless films, both captivating and monotonous. This particular film caught my attention due to its star-studded cast, promising storyline, and hype generated in the media. With immense anticipation, I decided to give this movie a try. Unfortunately, I cannot express my dismay enough, as the film failed to deliver on all fronts. Ultimately, Disappointment Unleashed struck me as a wasted opportunity, one that left a bitter aftertaste, much to my chagrin. From the very beginning, the plot seemed convoluted and contradictory, with various subplots emerging out of nowhere, only to disappear without any coherent resolution. The film failed miserably in weaving these erratic storylines, leaving the viewers unsatisfied and perplexed. The characters within the movie were shallow, one-dimensional, and unimaginative, as though developed without any sincere effort. Each character's motive seemed irrational or outright incoherent, leading to the inherent hollowness in each interpersonal relationship portrayed in the film. As the movie progressed, the viewer’s indifference only intensified, as the characters' actions were neither empathetic nor comprehensible. As for the acting, despite a remarkable cast, their performances were well below par. It is unfortunate that a group of well-esteemed actors succumbed to delivering lackluster performances, likely due to poor direction and an uninspired script. The dialogue seemed forced with cringe-worthy deliveries that saw a more convincing inner battle on the viewer’s side, trying to restrain from rolling their eyes at every banal statement. Visually, the movie lacked finesse and refinement, resulting in its inability to create an aesthetically engaging experience. The editing felt clumsy, and the cinematography was underwhelming. Scenes that should have been gripping and intense were reduced to mere caricatures, further disengaging the audience. The soundtrack was unremarkable, to say the least. It is clear that not enough thought was put into selecting music that would complement the story or evoke specific emotions. Instead, viewers were left to bear the mediocre sounds, which neither enhanced the experience nor lingered in one's memory. While the promotional material led us to believe that this was going to be an unforgettable cinematic experience, Disappointment Unleashed fell painfully short. With a poorly executed plot, shallow characters, lackluster performances, and subpar production value, this movie is a colossal letdown. In conclusion, Disappointment Unleashed is an unfortunate example of a promising premise turned sour. With underwhelming acting, a convoluted plotline, and a general lack of artistic merit, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone. It is my hope that both the cast and crew take this as a learning experience and strive for better, more thoughtful projects in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. Question: \\"What are some reasons for uses of the Albanian language?\\" Answer: \\"Protestant\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, this answer is not fully correct. It is true that the Protestant reforms played a role in the development of the Albanian language, but the answer should be broader and express multiple factors that contributed to the use of the Albanian language. A more accurate response could be: Some reasons for the uses of the Albanian language include its unique position within the Indo-European language family, cultural influences from Illyrian and Daco-Thracian roots, similarities with Balto-Slavic and Germanic languages, and the efforts to develop the language through church texts, publications, and liturgy in both Catholic and Orthodox regions.

The most common sign of heart disease in a german shepherd is a cough. This usually occurs at night when the animal is resting.","completion":"Treating heart disease in German Shepherds requires a combination of early detection, lifestyle changes, and veterinary care. Once you have identified the primary symptom, which is a cough, there are several steps to follow. 1. Consult with a veterinarian: The first thing you should do when you notice a persistent cough in your German Shepherd is to consult with a veterinarian. They will perform a thorough examination, including physical checkups, blood tests, and imaging studies to diagnose the type and severity of the heart disease. 2. Medication: Based on the diagnosis, your veterinarian may prescribe medications to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Common drugs used for treating heart disease in dogs include ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and positive inotropes. It is essential to follow the prescribed dosage and schedule to ensure the best outcome for your dog. 3. Weight management: Overweight dogs are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. Therefore, it is crucial to implement a weight management plan to maintain your German Shepherd's optimal weight. This may involve adjusting food portions, switching to a lower calorie diet, and minimizing treats. 4. Exercise and activity: While excessive exercise can aggravate the condition, a moderate and gradual exercise program is essential to maintain overall health. Daily walks, play sessions, and low-intensity activities can help regulate your dog's weight and prevent muscle wastage. 5. Diet and nutrition: Providing your German Shepherd with a well-balanced and nutritious diet is vital in managing heart disease. Talk to your veterinarian about specific dietary requirements based on your dog's condition and consider including cardiac-specific diets and supplements that provide essential nutrients for heart health. 6. Regular monitoring: Regular follow-up appointments with your veterinarian are essential in tracking your dog's progress and making necessary adjustments to their treatment plan. Monitoring vital signs and conducting periodic tests, such as chest X-rays and echocardiograms, will help your veterinarian determine the effectiveness of the treatment and modify it accordingly. 7. Manage stress and anxiety: Reducing stress and anxiety in your German Shepherd can help prevent complications related to heart disease. Provide them with a calm and comfortable environment, ensure they have a consistent daily routine, and use positive reinforcement training techniques to foster a sense of security and stability. 8. Alternative therapies: In some cases, alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, and supplements, can be used alongside conventional treatment methods to alleviate symptoms and improve overall health. Consult with your veterinarian before incorporating any alternative treatments to ensure their safety and effectiveness for your dog. 9. Education and support: As a pet owner, it is essential to educate yourself about heart disease in dogs, prevention strategies, and treatment options.

Joe found out that his cholesterol levels were within normal parameters, while Manny had very high cholesterol levels and was recommended some lifestyle changes. Which person had lower levels of HDL cholesterol? Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine who had lower levels of HDL cholesterol between Manny and Joe. However, we can make some educated guesses and analyze their individual situations. We know that Joe's cholesterol levels are within normal parameters, which suggests that his levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) are not elevated. It is likely that his levels of HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) are within a healthy range as well, since a balance between good and bad cholesterol is important for optimal heart health. High levels of HDL cholesterol are typically associated with a lower risk of heart disease, as it helps to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and prevents plaque buildup in the arteries. On the other hand, Manny has very high cholesterol levels, which means his LDL cholesterol is likely elevated. However, this information alone is not enough to determine Manny's HDL cholesterol levels. It is possible that Manny has high levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol, or he might have high LDL cholesterol levels and low HDL cholesterol levels. In general, a healthy lifestyle that includes a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, regular aerobic exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to better cholesterol levels. This includes lowering LDL cholesterol and increasing HDL cholesterol. Manny was recommended to make some lifestyle changes, which suggests that his current habits might not be fully conducive to heart health. By making these lifestyle changes, Manny can work towards improving his cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. In conclusion, without specific information about each individual's HDL cholesterol levels, we cannot definitively say who had lower levels. However, based on the information provided, we can surmise that Joe likely has a healthier balance of cholesterol levels, while Manny needs to work on making changes to improve his lipid profile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The customers can have limited conversations with Carl who also measures out spirits for another bartender to mix. The belt helps Carl stay upright instead of spilling drinks everywhere and protects his human counterparts. Another room in the bar, described as a place to encounter technology and future visions, contains a life-size model of a Nasa astronaut. Writing on the bar's website, Mr Schaefer said his company aims to make humanity in humanoid robots closer to reality and show that 'scenes as in science fiction films are quite possible'. Humanoid robots tend to have limbs and a torso to resemble the human body, while artificial intelligence tries to replicate the way the mind works. Mr Schaefer said putting Carl to work meant it was easier to see how the design needed improving than trying to figure out problems in a laboratory. Perhaps one day Carl may boast the skills of Tom Cruise in Cocktail, but for now his creator is making him useful by having him measure out spirits. By putting Carl in a real-life scenario, it was easier to test the programming and make improvements than it would be in a laboratory.

Q:Given the background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. and the situation: John is trying to figure out how the shape of an object affects how it reacts with other elements. For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work. Answer the following question: Which object would be more exposed to the reactants, object A or object B? A:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation John is investigating, the object that would be more exposed to the reactants would be object A. The reason for this is rooted in the basic understanding of how surface area affects the rate of a chemical reaction involving solids. When a solid substance participates in a chemical reaction, it interacts with other reactants primarily at its surface. This is due to the fact that the atoms or molecules on the surface are more accessible to the other reactants than those beneath the surface. Therefore, the more surface area a solid object has, the more of it is exposed to the reactants and is available to react. In John's experiment, object A has a larger surface area than object B. As a result, a greater proportion of object A's atoms or molecules are exposed to the reactants, allowing a higher number of simultaneous interactions to take place. This, in turn, increases the reaction rate for object A compared to object B. To relate this scenario to the provided rust example, consider the difference in rust formation between a hammer and nails. Both objects are made of iron, but the nails have a greater surface area due to their shape and number. This increased surface area leads to a faster rate of rust formation (oxidation of iron) on the nails compared to the hammer, as more iron atoms are exposed to oxygen in the air.

Article: Jeremy Renner’s injuries suffered while filming the New Line comedy Tag won’t impact his shooting schedule on Disney/Marvel’s The Avengers: Infinity War. The actor showed up in a pair of arm braces to the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic this week to support his latest pic Wind River, which is playing there. The two-time Oscar nominee fractured his right arm and left wrist in the on-set accident a couple of weeks ago; his shooting schedule had to be adjusted slightly, we hear, but production wasn’t impacted, helped by the fact that Tag is an ensemble pic. He stars alongside Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm and Annabelle Wallis in the movie based on a true story about a group of friends who have been playing a no-holds-barred version of the children’s game for the past 30 years. Warner Bros has set a June 29, 2018, release date. Renner of course plays Hawkeye in the Marvel Universe of pics, the latest of which, Infinity War Part I, is in production at Pinewood in Atlanta. Renner had not started his part of shooting, and his injuries won’t impact any set schedule. The movie has a May 4 release date; Part II is set for May 3, 2019. He also returns along with Tom Cruise and others for the next Mission: Impossible movie, which began production in April. That untitled pic has a July 27, 2018, release date. ||||| UPDATED: Jeremy Renner, who has been filming “Avengers: Infinity War” and recently started shooting the New Line comedy “Tag,” said Friday that he “broke his arms” during a stunt. The actor fractured his right elbow and his left wrist while filming “Tag.” “That’s how it goes,” Renner said. “It’s part of the job.” The actor was speaking at a Karlovy Vary Film Festival press conference on Friday for Taylor Sheridan’s “Wind River,” but also discussed his role in Marvel films like “Avengers: Infinity War,” creating confusion that he sustained the injuries during “Infinity War” filming. Smiling wryly, Renner said the injury wouldn’t affect his job. “I’m sort of a problem solver, you know. There will be an effect to it, but it won’t stop me from doing things that I need to be doing,” Renner said. “I’ll heal fast. I’m doing everything I can to heal faster.” The actor, who has appeared in action films like “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” said: “I’m doing a job [‘Tag’] that isn’t really requiring a ton of stunts. It’s not an action movie; it’s a comedy. It just happens to have a few stunts in it. So I don’t have to beat a whole lot of people up or do anything crazy. So it won’t really affect my job. … It affects how I get dressed in the morning. I can’t tie my shoes, but outside of that and everything else, I can kind of get by.” Related Jeremy Renner on His ‘Strange Tie’ to Sundance Crime Drama ‘Wind River’ Renner, who was Oscar-nominated for “The Town” and “The Hurt Locker,” says that he is sometimes “surprised” when he watches scenes from fantasy movies he has acted in, like Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War,” because of the visual effects that have been added in post-production. “Visual effects has become a huge part of filmmaking nowadays, and it is also done so well,” he said. “I remember watching the first ‘Avengers.’ … It was so big and there were so many characters and so many things going on, you can’t really understand from the script what the hell you are really doing. … Just figure out your character and your own piece in this puzzle.” “And then the effects take over. Once we’re done with principal photography, it goes into editing and the effects are added, and [the VFX] create the bad guys, the aliens, the backdrop,” he added. “So it is always a surprise when it comes to films like ‘Avengers’ and the whole Marvel universe to see [the finished movie]. It’s the only time that I really watch a movie that I’ve done because it is a complete surprise to me how it has actually turned out.” Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously reported that Renner sustained the injuries while filming a stunt for “Avengers: Infinity War.” He was instead shooting the comedy “Tag.” |||||Summary:","completion":"Jeremy Renner suffered injuries to his right arm and left wrist while filming the New Line comedy 'Tag,' but this will not impact his shooting schedule for Disney/Marvel's 'The Avengers: Infinity War.'

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Michael Zennie. PUBLISHED:. 12:48 EST, 14 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 16:10 EST, 14 August 2013. Ouch: Binge drinking costs more than just a hangover. The CDC says it costs more than 223.5billion a year. A shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than 223.5billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers. The research, released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control, finds that binge drinking, alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country. The health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail, pint of beer or glass of wine consumed, American society must pay nearly 2 in additional costs. The nation's capital, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to CDC figures, pays the most. Washington DC residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed. Those drinks cost out more than 966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than 1,660 per resident of the city. Utah, where strong influence from the Mormon church means alcohol is heavily regulated, has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs. Utah residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just 578 per capita. The shocking figure of 223.5billion is larger than the economies of Ireland and Pakistan. Researchers say it should serve as a wake-up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit. 'Excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the economy,' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said in a statement. 'In addition to injury, illness, disease, and death, it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity, increased criminal justice expenses, and higher healthcare costs. 'Effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol.' About 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through Medicare and Medicaid or by other government services. That amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families. Some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting. Binge drinkers account for an estimated 70percent of the cost of alcohol abuse in America, the CDC study found. Authors of the study cautioned that the data doesn't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers. A MailOnline analysis of CDC data shows that New Hampshire had the highest rates of alcohol consumption, with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006. Washington, DC, and Nevada were the next highest. However, the CDC points out that in New Hampshire many of the package liquor buyers come from other states and in Nevada - home to Sin City - much of the state's alcohol consumption can be attributed to tourists. The lowest per capita alcohol consumption was in Utah, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The study will be published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.","completion":"A new government study has revealed that excessive drinking costs the United States more than 223.5 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and early death.

This already sets a negative tone for the review and may sway potential buyers against purchasing the product. Secondly, the reviewer describes the album as \\"pure refined trash,\\" which is an extreme statement showing disapproval and distaste for the product. The use of this phrase indicates that, in the reviewer's opinion, the product is of very poor quality and does not meet their expectations. A potential buyer who reads this review might be discouraged from making the purchase, as they would not want to experience the same disappointment expressed in the review. Thirdly, the reviewer advises readers to \\"stay far away from this one,\\" further suggesting that the product is not worth buying. The use of strong language and capitalization indicates strong conviction in their opinion, potentially having a lasting impact on potential buyers. They are explicitly warning others to avoid purchasing the product and to spend their money elsewhere. Additionally, the reviewer recommends an alternative album - \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica. By doing so, they not only emphasize their dislike for the product in question but also suggest a different option that they deem superior. Potential buyers might be influenced to consider this recommended album instead, further decreasing the chances of purchasing the originally reviewed product.

The diet of the ancient Israelites was primarily plant-based and included the following: 1. Bread: Barley and wheat were staple grains. Bread was usually made from barley flour, while wheat was used for more expensive loaves. 2. Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, and beans were commonly consumed. 3. Vegetables: Onions, leeks, and garlic were essential flavorings, while cucumbers, melons, gourds, and leafy greens were also widely eaten. 4. Fruits: Figs, grapes, olives, and dates were typical fruits consumed. They could be eaten fresh or dried, and were often used to make juices and wines. 5. Dairy: Dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and milk, primarily from sheep and goats, were consumed by ancient Israelites. 6. Fish: Fish was a significant protein source, especially for populations living near water sources. 7. Meat: Although meat was considered a luxury and consumed less frequently, when available, it usually came from domestically raised animals like sheep, goats, and cattle. Poultry such as chicken and dove was also consumed. 8. Nuts and seeds: During the time of King David, people consumed almonds, walnuts, and sesame seeds as supplemental sources of fat and protein. 9. Olive oil: Olive oil was the primary type of oil used for cooking and in dressings. 10. Herbs and spices: Common herbs and spices included cumin, coriander, mint, dill, and mustard.

In his first season there, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases. He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidts mark of 48 in 1980.

From the outset, the application gave off a non-user-friendly vibe. I was under the impression that the interface was convoluted and too complex for someone just dipping their toes into this field. The layout was not intuitive, making navigation exceedingly laborious. Apps aimed at all users should ensure they cater to all skill levels, but this was certainly not the case here. Additionally, the application is riddled with technical flaws. It crashes more often than not, disrupting work and leading to a significant amount of data loss. Notably, despite repeated attempts, the app struggled to execute certain vital Linux commands correctly, which is an outright letdown given the app's primary purpose. The so-called 'customer support' was just as discouraging. I reached out for help several times due to the issues that I encountered, and either I received no response at all or it was delayed for such an extended period that it was nearly unhelpful. Lastly, regarding app updates, they are slow and scarce. Despite numerous negative feedback, the app seems to ignore the need for crucial bug fixes that could potentially improve the user experience dramatically. In conclusion, the BusyBox app by Meefik seems to have potential, but it fails to deliver on its promises right now. Between its unstable nature, convoluted interface, unresponsive customer service, and lack of pivotal updates, I found the app to be frustrating and inefficient in its current state. I can only hope the developers take user feedback seriously and refrain from overlooking these critical issues in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia? John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","completion":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia.

This game also allows you to use a few different options with X's armor which makes it a more custom experience. The overall game is a great example of where the X series should go in the future and for the price is worth the buy. Is this product review negative? The answer is:","completion":"No, this product review is not negative. It starts off expressing relief and satisfaction that a \\"good X game is back,\\" suggesting that the reviewer approves of the game and is pleased with the improvements made.

The reviewer describes the game as providing a \\"true X experience\\" that is enjoyable, even if it is considered somewhat easy. Although the reviewer states that the character switch option makes the game easier than they would prefer, it's not framed as a major downside to the game but rather a feature that lessens the game's difficulty level. The reviewer also appreciates the customizable features for X's armor, indicating that they enjoy having options to personalize their gameplay experience. They commend the overall game as a \\"great example of where the Series X should go.\\" This recognizes that the game could serve as an important reference point for the series' future direction, implying that the reviewer sees potential in the future of the series. Lastly, the reviewer believes the game is worth its price. If the reviewer saw the game as generally negative or disappointing, they would likely suggest it isn't worth the cost. Therefore, these points all lead to the conclusion that this review is not negative, but instead, it's somewhat balanced with a leaning towards positive. Yes, there are criticisms, but the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects and improvements, expresses optimism about the future of the series, and deems the game a worthy purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards World War 2 that the media exhibits. Rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocents. Most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of \\"civility\\" are removed. There is something distinctly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on. Perhaps there could be a follow up series called \\"The century at war\\" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors.

Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.

Title: Fly Away Home Movie plot: After her mother dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is brought from New Zealand to Ontario, Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels), a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan (Dana Delany). When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development. Thomas (Jeff Daniels) attempts to get the geese to follow him. Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amyâs aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen...

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. The story is set in 1966. Its main protagonist is a girl named Saya, who hunts bat-like creatures called chiropterans. Saya is introduced on a subway train, where she assassinates a man in a suit. Her American contacts or handlers arrive. One of them, David, begins to brief Saya on another mission, while the other, Louis, discovers that the man Saya has just killed was probably not a chiropteran.Saya's next mission begins at the American Yokota Air Base, which is active in the buildup to the Vietnam War. At least one chiropteran has managed to infiltrate the air base, and it is only a matter of time before they feed again, go into hibernation, and become untraceable. Saya is to pose as a school girl, infiltrate the high school adjacent to the base, and then track and kill the chiropterans.At the school, Saya runs into a meek nurse, Makiho Amano, on the eve of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and wounding Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be chiropterans. Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The chiropterans trap them inside and attack.David delivers a new sword, and Saya uses it to kill Sharon. The final chiropteran then decides to flee, attempting to stow away on a departing cargo plane. David and Saya give chase and she manages to strike the chiropteran and mortally wound it. She then stands over the dying creature and lets some of her blood trickle into its mouth. Louis arrives and recovers Makiho before the local police reach her.Afterwards, Makiho is seen at an interview with government officials who question her about the night's events. However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the chiropterans has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word \\"VAMPIRE\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Your hair doesn't need to be freshly washed for this method, but it should be damp. If you're starting with dry hair, use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. If you decide to wash your hair, let it dry a bit before putting your hair in buns. To get big, messy Beyoncé waves, you need to give your hair some body. Whether you use a cream, gel, or spray, be sure to apply a light coat to all of your hair. If your hair tends to get frizzy, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or oil as well. If you plan on blowdrying your hair, apply heat protectant to your hair. How much hair you have will determine how many buns you'll need. If you have thicker hair, you will most likely need 2-3 buns. If you have finer hair, you can get away with 1-2 buns. Hold each section in place with a hair tie until it is time to put it in a bun. The way you divide your hair is completely up to you. For example, you can part your hair down the middle so that you have one bun on each side of your head, or you can place the top half of your hair in one bun, and the bottom half of your hair in another bun. This method works best on longer hair styles. If you have shorter hair, you may need to add an extra bun or two to ensure that no pieces of hair are left out of a bun. Take the first section of your hair out of it's hair tie. Twirl your hair and twist it into a bun – think of tight Princess Leia buns, or the swirl of a cinnamon roll to give you an idea of what these buns should look like. Don't worry about the buns looking perfect, but make sure all of your hair is twisted tightly. Secure the bun with a hair tie, a hair clip, or bobby pins. Make sure the ends of your hair are tucked into your bun. Repeat this process with each section of hair. Ideally, you should sleep in your buns overnight to set the waves into your hair. If you're able to sleep in your buns overnight, tie a scarf around your head to prevent your hair from frizzing. If you don't have all night to let your hair dry, it's time to blow dry those buns! To ensure your buns are thoroughly dried, blow dry each bun for at least 10 minutes. (Remember, if you plan on blowdrying your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair before you put it in buns). Unwrap each bun and gently loosen each twist with your fingers. Once you've taken all of your buns down, style your hair. If you like the messy waves, only use your fingers to comb through your hair. If you want a smoother look, brush your hair. Finish your Beyoncé look with hairspray. Summary:","completion":"This article provides a method for creating big, messy Beyoncé waves in your hair.

Rebecca asked Mary to turn off her phone while in the theater, because Possible answers: [i] Rebecca is being rude. [ii] Mary is being rude.","completion":"Mary hesitated for a moment before reaching into her bag to find her phone. As the lights began to dim in the theater, Rebecca could sense the discomfort and annoyance building up amongst their fellow audience members due to Mary's glowing screen. Although she didn't want to assume the role of a scolding friend, Rebecca understood that it was essential to remind Mary of the importance of maintaining proper etiquette during a live performance. Rebecca was in no way trying to be rude when she asked Mary to turn off her phone. Instead, she was merely upholding the unwritten rules of theater etiquette, which demonstrate respect for the performers and fellow audience members alike. The primary reason behind this request was to prevent any disruptions, such as the noise and visual distraction caused by an active cell phone. One could argue that Mary was, in fact, unaware that her actions were being perceived as rude. She may not have realized the severity of using her phone in a dimly-lit theater, where it's easy for others to be distracted by the bright screen. Her primary focus might have been on her own convenience or connectedness, rather than considering how her actions could negatively impact those around her. However, it would be more accurate to say that Mary was unintentionally being rude rather than purposely disregarding the feelings of others. After Rebecca's gentle reminder, Mary promptly turned off her phone to make sure her actions didn't disturb others any further. The situation also highlights the importance of open communication and understanding amongst friends. If Rebecca hadn't spoken up, the distractions caused by Mary's phone usage might have ruined the theater experience for those seated around them. By expressing her concerns, Rebecca was able to prevent any further disturbances and ensure a pleasant time for both herself and her friend, as well as the rest of the audience. Ultimately, the lesson learned from this incident is that when attending a live performance, audience members should always be mindful of the potential impact of their actions on others. Turning off cell phones and other electronic devices plays a crucial role in reducing interruptions and preserving the integrity of the theater-going experience for everyone involved. In conclusion, while it could be perceived that Rebecca was being rude by pointing out Mary's mistake, her actions were actually intended for the betterment of the theater experience as a whole. On the other hand, Mary's cell phone usage could be interpreted as rude, but it may have been unintentional on her part. The key takeaway is that mutual understanding, open communication, and adherence to theater etiquette help create a harmonious environment where everyone can fully enjoy live performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It appears Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki will step down. There had been concern that after eight years he would try to hold on to power by military force. And correspondent David Martin reports that President Obama is sending about 130 more American military advisers to Iraq. There are 250 in the country already. They're helping the Iraqi government roll back ISIS, a Muslim extremist army that has taken control of parts of Iraq and Syria. Obama ordered airstrikes on ISIS when it threatened the Kurdish city of Erbil in northern Iraq. That's where these new American advisers would go, to help thousands of refugees who are surrounded on Mount Sinjar. On Monday, when an Iraqi helicopter dropped water to help the refugees, some refugees seized the chance and jumped aboard. On Tuesday, a similar Iraqi mission crashed after it was rushed by refugees. The pilot was killed. Many were injured. Refugees are fleeing because ISIS militants have murdered, by the thousands, anyone who is not a member of their Sunni Muslim faith. CBS News discovered what's happening to the Christians. CBS News We visited the town of Bartella two months ago, as ISIS militants began their campaign of violence and terror in northern Iraq. Christians have lived here for at least 1,500 years. They still pray in Aramaic - the language spoken by Christ. With the Islamic extremists just 10 miles away, Capt. Firaz Jacob and his 600 local militiamen had vowed to protect their home. We asked what they would do if the militants came to this Christian town? \\"We don't know,\\" Firaz told us, speaking in Arabic, \\"but maybe they'll do what they've done in other places and kill us.\\" Capt. Firaz and his men held on until last week when ISIS went on the rampage again, capturing more territory for what they say is their own, Islamic state. The townspeople fled in the middle of the night. Now, 200 families are crowded into a community hall, including baby Marbel, who was born the same day they ran for their lives. CBS News These are proud people who have lost everything and have nowhere to go. Capt. Firaz is here and told us he was the last to leave Bartella, after everyone else had made it out. Does he think they will ever be able to go back to Bartella? \\"If we go back to our town in a few months or a few years we'll be pushed out again,\\" he said. \\"We need somewhere safe to live.\\" Many people blame the current prime minister, al-Maliki, for fueling religious and ethnic tensions here. He's now isolated and will probably have to leave office. He's lost the support of his Iranian backers as well as the militias that were once loyal to him. But the question is whether a new government can end those hatreds and unify Iraq. ||||| He's a charismatic figure, the sort that would catch the eye of any good photo editor. Clad in all black except for the beige kaffiyeh wrapping his face, he stands, arms raised, weapon in one hand, ISIS flag in the other. Through dark aviators, he stares down the camera from just a few feet away. The picture above, dated June 23, filed by an unnamed photographer, and distributed by Reuters, claims to be of a jihadi militant on the streets of Mosul, two weeks after the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, now called the Islamic State (IS), shocked the world by taking control of Iraq's second-largest city. Time used the image. So did Newsweek, The Daily Beast, The New York Review of Books, and NBC News. And thus, the world got one of its earliest glimpses of Islamic State-controlled Iraq: defiant, in control, triumphant. The sudden takeover of a wide swath of Iraq by Syria-based militants calling themselves the Islamic State is both one of the biggest stories of the year and one of the hardest for news organizations to cover. The brutality that made ISIS notorious over the course of the Syrian civil war has become a fundamental part of its Iraqi regime. Few journalists have been allowed in by IS's media arms to provide a sense of what life is like under the Islamic State -- which is, in part, why a VICE News documentary that premiered Aug. 7, in which filmmaker Medyan Dairieh spent three weeks with the group, has been generating a stir. Most media coverage of the Islamic State's reign has come from areas of relative safety, such as refugee camps in Kurdistan where those fleeing the jihadi advance have taken shelter, or from those embedded with the Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting against further IS incursions. Few reports have included direct contact with the militants themselves, only with those caught up in their wake. Except, that is, for the photos. Shortly after the takeover, a handful of news agencies, including giants like Reuters and the Associated Press (AP), began sending out pictures from Mosul. Shot by anonymous stringers -- that is, freelancers who contribute regularly -- the photos reveal daily life under a self-declared caliphate, and depict everything from raucous demonstrations full of fluttering jihadi flags and weapons-filled checkpoints to more mundane scenes of bustling markets. Taken together, they show a combination of breathtaking brutality, widespread support, and a well-functioning state. They're also fraught with ethical pitfalls. The use of unnamed freelancers by major news organizations in an area ruled by one of the world's most dangerous militant groups has raised a host of questions, from how these agencies can ensure their journalists' safety to whether they can vouch for the methods of the anonymous photographers working for them -- or these journalists' relationship with the IS fighters they claim to cover. And as interviews with a few of the photographers currently working within the caliphate indicate, some agencies are willing to work far outside of traditional journalistic norms in order to provide a window into the world now almost entirely cut off from outsiders, in some cases even sacrificing editorial control to militant jihadists -- all in order to get an up-close glimpse of the enemy. Abu Mirwan -- not his real name -- has worked as a photographer in Iraq for well over a decade. He is now filing photographs for an international agency, he said in a telephone interview in early August. (He wouldn't say which one.) After the IS takeover of Mosul, Mirwan, a Sunni Iraqi, reached out to an agent of the caliphate, who said he could get him permission to work again. The agent was true to his word, Mirwan said. He even shared a pleasant meal with three IS leaders, who told him they would help him by giving him stories and inviting him to see IS events. The congeniality didn't last long. Mirwan says that a few days later, he was taken to see another member of IS's leadership. It was a very different meeting. The IS leader threatened Mirwan, telling him that if he did anything that damaged IS's reputation, he'd be killed and that if he took any photographs without IS knowledge, he'd be given 100 lashes. From now on, he was told, before he sent out any photos, he'd have to share his memory cards for approval first. And that's how he's operated since, Mirwan says. IS invites him to cover events, such as military shows and rallies. He photographs them, with a minder in tow, and when he's through, he clears his images with an IS representative before they go out to either the international agency he works with, or to a local agency he works with which then passes them on to its international contacts. Mirwan was recruited to document IS's recent attack on the town of Sinjar, he says -- the same takeover whose aftermath has prompted U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. There, he was photographing fighting until a few members of ISIS called him over. Thirty men lay waiting facedown on the ground, hands bound behind their backs. Three or four women were standing by, watching. It was an execution. Take the pictures, he was told. Mirwan says he's frightened. But the money he makes filing for international agencies is good, he says, and taking photos is the only way he knows to make a living. \\"I've been doing this job for 15 years,\\" he said. \\"This is how I support my family.\\" Not all imagery coming out of the Islamic State is vetted like Mirwan's. Mohammed (who is also using a pseudonym because he fears IS reprisals) has been working as a journalist for over 10 years and is currently based in Mosul, running a local photo agency, where he has two photographers working under him. In a phone interview in late July, he said his agency sells between seven to 10 photos a day, for about 50 a photo. They work with a variety of different agencies, he says, but mainly with the AP. The agency doesn't know who the stringers supplying its photos are, Mohammed says. He is the AP's only point of contact for his agency's photos. Mohammed says his photographers operate without IS permission, snapping furtive images via camera phones and transmitting them out of IS territory by satellite. And not all of AP's Mosul photography has been flattering for IS, in the mode of packed rallies and lively markets: The agency has sent out photos, for instance, of Mosul residents walking over rubble -- the aftermath of IS's destruction of the Tomb of Jonah the Prophet, a revered Muslim shrine. Another photo shows an empty park, where a statue of Iraqi poet and cultural icon Adi Tammam once stood. Mohammed and his photographers do tremendously risky work, but AP is very good to him, he says, and is concerned with his safety: The agency will call to check in on him, and remind him not to take unnecessary risks. But few are willing to take these sorts of chances. Mohammed says he knows of other photographers operating under the same conditions as Mirwan: filing only photos that have been cleared with an IS representative, working out of a TV station in Mosul, who keeps all the images on file. AP refused Foreign Policy's repeated requests for an interview on its decision to use unnamed stringers in Mosul. However, in an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote, \\"The Associated Press is transparent about the source of images we distribute and the safety of our journalists is paramount.\\" Over email, a Reuters spokesperson did not respond to a list of nine questions including one about whether the agency knows the identity of its stringers in IS-controlled Iraq, and whether it was comfortable with the requirement that any photographer working in Mosul must appear to support IS. Instead, the agency issued a statement saying it \\"chooses a mix of staff and stringers to provide the best coverage ... which is hallmarked by its independence and freedom from bias.\\" It balances the use of staff photographers and stringers based on operational requirements, said spokesman Chris Artis, \\"as well as the deep knowledge of the conflict held by local editors.\\" News agencies' decisions about whether to rely on stringers in IS territory take place against the backdrop of the intensifying propaganda war unfolding between the Islamic State and the Iraqi government -- one that many have argued IS is winning. The group has shown a particular savvy when it comes to brand management: It maintains active social media accounts, regularly publishing images, including the occasional gruesome beheading or mass execution, which are often picked up by news outlets. The militants have a designated propaganda arm, known as the Al Hayat Media Center, which produces high-production videos and a magazine. And reports from other areas under IS control describe similar attempts to control all information bound for the outside world through similar review processes as those described by Mirwan and Mohamed in Mosul: IS set up an \\"information office\\" in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, for instance. For its part, in response to IS's effective public relations efforts, the Iraqi government has issued a set of \\"guidelines\\" for members of the media covering the fight against IS that forbids \\"broadcast[ing] the messages of armed groups or their savage acts\\" while exhorting journalists to praise \\"the heroic acts performed by security personnel,\\" and to \\"broadcast programs that spread enthusiasm and a fighting spirit against terror.\\" (The guidelines were condemned by human rights groups as an attempt to prevent critical coverage.) Providing anonymity for photographers operating in dangerous territory is a common practice for news organizations, including Reuters and the Associated Press. But the combination of a particularly violent subject, known for its PR savvy, and photographers with whom these agencies have little familiarity and at times almost no contact, is problematic, journalism ethics experts say. By running images from photographers like Mirwan and Mohammed, news organizations open themselves up to charges that they're serving as what Ethical Journalism Network Director Aidan White calls \\"unwilling foot soldiers\\" of extremists in this propaganda war. \\"It's the question of whether or not one is falling into the trap of actually promoting the political interests of\\" the Islamic State, White said. But while news agencies must be aware of the hazards of allowing a dangerous group to depict itself on its own terms, they must also balance against the value of providing public information about an important newsmaker, said Patrick Baz, Middle East and North Africa editor for Agence France-Presse (AFP). AFP hasn't used stringers in IS-controlled Mosul, but it has distributed the group's own images of what it claims to be executions. They're photos that may be intended to intimidate, Baz says, but they also have what he calls \\"historical value.\\" \\"We all know it's propaganda, but we all know at the same time that the world needs to see what's going on,\\" he said. \\"Our duty is to ring the alarm bell and say, 'Hey guys, this is what's going on. This is what we've found on these guys' website.'\\" And conceding some editorial independence for the sake of access isn't a situation unique to the Islamic State, he says. News agencies readily use images distributed by the U.S. army, the Israeli army, or NATO forces, Baz said -- decisions that are rarely, if ever, questioned. And military embeds, for instance, often come only after extensive screenings, and with their own restrictions on coverage (though these are typically couched in terms of security, and aren't accompanied by promises of lashings). In the buildup to the premier of part one of VICE News' documentary, the company touted its journalist's \\"unprecedented access.\\" Indeed, VICE's cameras appear to go deep into the caliphate, and the footage they capture is chilling: In the first two installments, based in Raqqa, Syria, children as young as 11 pledge loyalty to the caliphate, and IS members give brazen interviews that include pledging to \\"raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\\" There are also happy scenes, of a sort: Men living under IS rule play with children in a river. And front and center, of course, are the demonstrations of Islamic State power: a tank spinning in circles; IS's signature black flag waving from a turret; a parade of stolen Iraqi weapons; a rally in which a crowd is prodded into a call-and-response: \\"The Caliphate!\\" \\"Established!\\" In an email statement to Foreign Policy, VICE offered no details about the terms of the embed, nor did it share them in an interview with the Huffington Post. It said it offered \\"a previously unseen look at life under the control of this terrifying extremist group\\" and said filmmaker Dairieh \\"has worked in the region's most challenging environments ... and has extensive contacts.\\" In forthcoming episodes, VICE promises to take viewers further into IS's world. They'll watch prisoners detail how they'll be punished for their crimes, see an IS-run wheat mill, and hear a representative talk about the group's plans to establish schools and factories. Viewers will have no sense of how much of the footage may have been screened ahead of time by the group before airing, or the degree to which IS decided where VICE's cameras would go. The documentary is fascinating. Watching men and young children declare their passion for jihad, seeing masked men on horses patrolling city streets -- it's hard to look away. How much it tells us about the reality of life under a caliphate is an entirely different matter. Part two of the documentary closes with a scene of an IS recruitment rally, which many attendees are shown filming on their cellphones. \\"The Islamic State has been established,\\" a kaffiyeh-wearing man sings to the gathered crowd. \\"Beautiful virgins are calling; enroll me as a martyr.\\" The crowd stares back. Some sing along. The weapons are held high, and rows of black flags flutter in the background. Sebastian Meyer contributed reporting from northern Iraq.

Summarize this article: (CNN) Pope Francis on Tuesday radically revised the process by which Catholics may annul their marriages, streamlining steps that many in the church considered too cumbersome and costly. The move is the latest in a series of reforms by Francis as he seeks to make the church more responsive to the real needs of lay Catholics, especially those who have long felt marginalized by the hierarchy. Without the annulments, Catholics who remarry are not allowed to receive Holy Communion, which many describe as a painful exclusion from the church's chief sacrament. The Vatican announcement also comes just weeks before Francis makes his first-ever visit to the United States. Americans accounted for about half of the nearly 50,000 annulments granted in 2012, the latest year for which statistics are available. \\"This move is in accord with the Pope's oft-repeated image of the Church as a 'field hospital' that goes out to meet people where they are most in need, and then to treat their most serious wounds first -- rather than stay at home and wait for people to come to them,\\" said the Rev. James Bretzke, an expert on papal affairs at Boston College. The three main changes announced on Tuesday are are: • Eliminating a second review by a cleric before a marriage can be nullified. • Giving bishops the ability to fast-track and grant the annulments themselves in certain circumstances -- for example, when spousal abuse or an extramarital affair has occurred. • The process should be free, except for a nominal fee for administrative costs, and should be completed within 45 days. The Pope's reforms came Tuesday in the form of two \\"motu proprio\\" documents, Latin for \\"by (the Pope's) own initiative.\\" They become part of Catholic canon law on December 8, the beginning of Francis' declared \\"Year of Mercy.\\" While Francis reaffirmed the \\"indissolubility of the marriage bond,\\" he also said in Tuesday's documents that \\"charity and mercy demand that the Church, as mother, be close to her children who consider themselves separated.\\" In the end, the church's many laws and institutions must be aimed at one chief purpose, the Pope said -- \\"the salvation of souls.\\" One prominent Catholic priest called Tuesday's announcement \\"an act of mercy from a pastoral Pope who listens carefully to the concerns of the people.\\" Francis's streamlining of the annulment process is an act of mercy from a pastoral Pope who listens carefully to the concerns of the people. — James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) September 8, 2015 'People give up' Francis has said that obtaining annulments can be too onerous, dragging on for years and costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars. \\"Some procedures are so long and so burdensome,\\" the pontiff said in 2014, \\"and people give up.\\" Here's what one former Catholic had to say: \\"25 years ago this would have changed my life.

Just 61% of African Catholics seeking annulments in 2012 completed the process, according to a study conducted by Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. In the more wealthy Western world, where Catholics can afford to hire canon lawyers, 86% received annulments. \\"This is not because tribunals in Africa were more likely than those in the Americas to rule contrary to nullity,\\" the center said in its analysis . \\"It is more a reflection of more people seeking annulments in Africa than in the Americas not completing the annulment process.\\" In the United States, 28% of Catholic marriages end in divorce, according to the General Social Survey. That's lower than the general population, but still equivalent to 11 million adults. The Catholic Church does not recognize civil divorces. Instead, its theology holds that marital unions sanctified by God are indissoluble. Annulments, once available only through church tribunals, state that the marriage contract was fundamentally flawed from the start, and hence invalid in the eyes of the church. In the 1980s, the church added another step to the process , requiring a second review before an annulment can be granted. Without an annulment, a divorced Catholic who remarries is considered an adulterer and may not participate in some sacraments, including Holy Communion. Led by Pope Francis, the church is holding high-level meetings, called synods, to debate that teaching. The next synod is to be held in October. The 'Year of Mercy' Tuesday's announcement is yet another step in Francis' efforts to reform the church, making it more welcoming to those who may have felt excluded after running afoul of Catholic teachings. On September 1, he announced that during an upcoming \\"Year of Mercy,\\" Catholic priests around the world will be able to forgive the \\"sin\\" of abortion. Under canon law, absolution of certain serious sins, including abortion, is usually reserved only to bishops. With the abortion and annulment announcements, Francis seems to be signaling a \\"third way\\" to govern the church through thorny issues. He's not rewriting core doctrines, but he is encouraging Catholic clergy to be more merciful and at times more flexible in how they enforce church rules. Francis' experience in his native Argentina, where many of his parishioners were poor, gives him a different view of the church and how its complex set of rules can alienate some Catholics, said Andrew Chesnut, an expert on religion in Latin America and a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. Chesnut called the Pope's annulment proposal part of an overall strategy to create a more inclusive church and reach out to lapsed Catholics who might have left the fold over issues such as divorce, abortion and homosexuality. \\"The church has been in sharp decline in both Latin America and Europe,\\" Chesnut said, \\"and Pope Francis sees such reforms as key to reversing the long-term slide.\\" It remains to be seen, though, how conservative Catholics receive the changes. Many have argued in recent years that the church should hold a firm line against what they see as widespread sexual immorality, particularly in the modern West. ||||| After his speech to Congress, Pope Francis speaks to a crowd at St. Patrick Church in Washington, D.C. and meets with throngs of admirers at a Catholic Charities feeding event for the homeless.

Pope Francis radically reformed the Catholic Church's process for annulling marriages Tuesday, allowing for fast-track decisions and removing automatic appeals in a bid to speed up and simplify the procedure. By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Tuesday made it simpler and swifter for Catholics to secure a marriage annulment, the most radical such reform for 250 years, and told bishops to be more welcoming to divorced couples. Under the old norms, it often took years to win an annulment, with hefty legal fees attached. Francis said the procedure should be free and the new rules mean that a marriage might be declared null and void in just 45 days in some cases. The announcement came the week after Francis signaled a more merciful approach to women who had obtained abortions and was another sign of his drive to shake up the hidebound Roman Catholic Church and try to soften some of its more rigid rules. In a document known as a Motu Proprio, Latin for \\"by his own initiative\\", Francis reaffirmed traditional teaching on the \\"indissolubility of marriage\\", making clear that the Vatican was not in any form promoting or sanctioning divorce. However, he said he would make it easier for separated couples to obtain an annulment -- a ruling whereby the Church decides that a marriage was not valid in the first place because certain prerequisites such as free will, psychological maturity and openness to having children were lacking. View gallery Pope Francis greets newlyweds during the general audience in the Paul VI hall at the Vatican, Wednes … Francis eliminated a previously mandatory review of an annulment decision by a second tribunal and gave bishops sweeping powers to judge quickly the most clear-cut cases. He said he had decided to streamline procedures so that Catholics who sought annulments should not be \\"long oppressed by darkness of doubt\\" over whether they could have their marriages declared null and void. MOST CHANGE IN 250 YEARS Monsignor Pio Vito Pinto, dean of the Vatican appeals court that rules on annulments, told a news conference the new rules were the most substantive changes to the laws since the papacy of Benedict XIV, who reigned from 1740 to 1758. \\"The pope is seeking to respond pastorally to the tens of thousands of couples who are experiencing profound pain and alienation as a result of broken marriages,\\" said Father James Bretzke, theology professor at Boston College. Francis took charge of the 1.2 billion member Church in 2013, replacing Pope Benedict, a theological hardliner well liked by conservatives for seeking to reaffirm traditional Catholic identity. The Argentine pope has appeared a much more approachable figure and has spoken repeatedly of the need for the Church to show mercy and understand the needs of Catholics struggling to live by its rules. Catholics who divorce and remarry in civil ceremonies are considered by the Church to be still married to their first spouse and living in a state of sin. This bars them from receiving sacraments such as communion. While not changing this position, Francis wrote on Tuesday that bishops should show \\"particular pastoral concern\\" for divorced and remarried Catholics. Many couples and priests have complained that the complex procedures discourage even those with legitimate grounds for an annulment from trying to obtain one. Some 50,000 annulment procedures were launched last year, nearly half of them in the United States, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University. Francis is due to pay a landmark visit to the United States next month, where his progressive views on climate change and condemnation of rampant capitalism look certain to put him at loggerheads with Republican presidential hopefuls.

Make a note of their approximate due dates, frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually), and the average amount for each bill. 2. Choose a tracking method: Select a bill tracking method that works best for you. Options include: a spreadsheet, a physical calendar, an app or software, or a simple handwritten list. Apps like Mint, Prism, and Honeydue are specifically designed for tracking expenses, bills, and due dates on your smartphone or tablet. If you prefer a more traditional option, use a wall calendar or planner dedicated to bill payment tracking. 3. Input bill details: For each bill on your master list, input the required details in your chosen tracking method. This includes the bill name or description, due date, frequency, amount, and any reference numbers, such as account or invoice numbers. 4. Set reminders: Setting reminders for bill due dates is crucial to ensure timely payments and avoid late fees. For digital tracking methods, create reminders or alerts at least a week before each due date. For physical calendars or planners, use highlighters, colored pens, or sticky notes to draw attention to due dates. 5. Consolidate bill payments: To simplify your bill management, schedule and group your bill payments around one or two dates each month, if possible. This way, you can tackle multiple bills at once, reducing the likelihood of missing any due dates. 6. Organize bill payment methods: Choose the most convenient payment methods for you. These may include mailing a check, paying online, using automatic payments, or paying in person. Store payment information securely, such as account login details and passwords, either digitally or in a secure physical location. 7. Create a filing system for paid bills: Once your bills are paid, file the payment confirmations in an organized manner, either digitally or physically. This will help you keep track of your financial history and easily access documentation in the event of a dispute or issue with a bill. 8. Regularly review and update your bill tracking system: Make it a habit to review your bill tracking system at least once a week to ensure that you're staying on top of your due dates and staying organized. Update the system as needed, for example, when you add or remove a bill or when there are changes to your payment amounts or due dates. By following these steps, you can create an efficient bill organization system that will not only improve your financial management but also reduce stress and the risk of late payments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Were Adam and Eve babies like the rest of us or were they made as adult bodied people? Biblical Figures: How was 'Adam' created, as a baby or a man? If as a baby, how was he brought up, and, if as a man, how old was he as soon as he was born?","completion":"While both questions address the creation of Adam (and to some extent, Eve) in the biblical narrative, they differ in perspective and scope. The first question, \\"Were Adam and Eve babies like the rest of us or were they made as adult-bodied people?\\" seeks a more straightforward answer on whether the first human beings were created as babies or adults. It focuses on comparing the creation of Adam and Eve to the natural human developmental process. The second question, \\"Biblical Figures: How was 'Adam' created, as a baby or a man? If as a baby, how was he brought up, and, if as a man, how old was he as soon as he was born?\\" examines the creation of Adam more intricately, by contemplating possible scenarios based on the mode of his creation. It enquires about the upbringing of Adam if he were created as a baby, and about his age at the moment he was created as a man. The second question digs deeper into the implications of each possibility, while the first one presents a more generalized query. To provide a comprehensive answer to both questions, we can explore the biblical account of their creation. In the Bible, specifically in the book of Genesis, Adam—the first human—is created by God out of the \\"dust of the ground\\" (Genesis 2:7). God forms him as an adult man and breathes life into him. Since Adam is created in this way, he does not experience infancy or childhood but rather begins his existence as a fully-formed adult. Eve, the first woman, is also created as an adult. According to Genesis 2:21-22, God takes one of Adam's ribs while he sleeps and creates Eve from this rib. Like Adam, Eve does not undergo infancy and development but begins her existence as an adult woman. In conclusion, while both questions delve into the creation and age of Adam and, to some extent, Eve, they differentiate in terms of their perspective and the depth of their inquiry. Nevertheless, the biblical account indicates that both Adam and Eve were created as adult-bodied individuals, bypassing conventional infant and childhood stages."},{"prompt":"Q:Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials.

By Giancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporter, BBC Scotland news website His son, Alan, took his own life at Lockerbie railway station in June 2015 aged just 31. After the funeral, Mr Ritchie decided to find out all he could about suicide and what more could be done to help people like his boy. It was not about blame, more about focus and purpose, he explained. \\"I've spent the last two years in a sense investigating the many charities that are involved in mental health in Dumfries and Galloway,\\" he said. \\"And what I hope to do within the next year or so is focus on perhaps one or two. \\"I am finding out about all of these charities and then focusing in on maybe one or two where I can be of best use to them. \\"There are many, many charities out there and many people are perhaps not aware of that and aware of the help that they can get if they can just get to the website or a telephone number or something like that.\\" He said the Scottish government was already doing good work to raise awareness of mental health with a 10-year action plan and its work on a suicide reduction strategy which he has been involved with. \\"That's where I hope that I can spread the message and signpost to people who may wish to help,\\" he said. He recently spoke to a group of 50 mental health nursing students and, through what he describes as his \\"journey\\" with his own son, he feels he can help others to understand the issue. \\"He wasn't a youngster who hid his depression and anxiety - he was very willing to talk about it,\\" he said. \\"He spent really half his lifetime seeking ways to help him cope with his anxiety and depression - medication, therapy, going to Samye Ling and so on.\\" 'Lot of strength' Mr Ritchie said that if someone facing mental health challenges could talk to someone it could help their journey to \\"discovery and recovery\\" rather than feeling isolated and alone. He said: \\"It takes a lot of strength to actually admit: 'I don't feel well, there is something wrong with me psychologically and I need help.' \\"That can sometimes be something which they suppress all the time until perhaps it is too late. \\"Listening is very, very important.\\" He added that simply telling someone to \\"man up\\" - as was often done - was not the way to help. He said: \\"That's not the right answer - the right answer should be: 'Let's sit down, let's talk about it, let's discuss it and let's see where, if you feel you want help, you can get help.'\\" 'Strictest confidence' Mr Ritchie said that employers could also have a part to play. \\"A good organisation, a caring organisation will call in such charities as, say Samaritans, who will talk to employees about what work they do,\\" he said. He said that it sometimes helped to talk to an outsider. \\"Some people who have these mental health challenges don't necessarily want to discuss it or open up to family and friends but they may wish to open up to somebody who is impartial, who is non-judgmental, who is a stranger,\\" he said. \\"They can speak to you in the strictest confidence. \\"When you are talking to people about their problems and their issues it is so important you listen and you don't judge and you don't particularly give advice.\\" Occasions like World Mental Health Day, which falls on 10 October, help to highlight these issues. 'Help at hand' Mr Ritchie, from Lockerbie, said he had found local politicians had also been willing to spread the word about mental health and the help available. In some circumstances he believes it is appropriate to contact the emergency services - or seek urgent medical help. \\"If you are in a crisis and you are feeling so low that you may wish to injure yourself or take your own life - call an ambulance, talk to a friend, talk to a member of your family, go to A&E. \\"That's not just a personal thing that is actually written within the strategy that I have looked at through the Scottish Parliament.\\" He said that was an option many people might not have thought about. \\"If you break your leg, or you're in a car accident or suddenly you've got a terrible sore stomach or a blinding headache you go to A&E,\\" he said. \\"If you're depressed, if you're low if you don't know where to turn then phone Samaritans or go to A&E and take it from there, help is at hand.\\" Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the main topic of the text.

(2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \\"Ethio-Somali\\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? feels homogenized and a bit contrived ,","completion":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"feels homogenized and a bit contrived\\" can be interpreted as negative. Here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. \\"Homogenized\\" - This term indicates that the movie lacks uniqueness or distinctiveness and appears similar to other films in its genre or presentation. When a work is described as homogenized, it suggests that the creative aspects of the film are not standing out or offering something fresh and different for the viewer. This can lead to disappointment and a sense of déjà vu while watching the movie, which is generally perceived as a negative aspect. The reviewer might feel that the filmmakers did not take any risks or employ innovative ideas to set the movie apart from the rest. 2. \\"A bit contrived\\" - The phrase \\"a bit contrived\\" suggests that certain elements of the movie feel forced or unnatural. This could refer to the plot, the dialogue, the relationships between the characters, or any other aspect of the film that doesn't seem to flow organically or naturally. When a movie is described as contrived, it implies that the filmmakers might have attempted to manipulate the audience's emotions or reactions by using clichéd or overly predetermined elements. This kind of inauthenticity is generally not well received by viewers, and it negatively impacts their overall enjoyment of the movie. Taking into account the above explanation, the sentiment of this movie review sentence is negative. The reviewer seems to express disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie, noting that it lacks originality and suffers from a forced or unnatural feeling throughout. These factors contribute to an unfavorable perception of the film and suggest that the reviewer didn't find the movie particularly enjoyable or engaging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a new situation: two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population. But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. What is an answer for this question: Which country had an increased food supply?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that Italy, with its smaller population, would have had an increased food supply when compared to Spain, which had a larger population.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question Lee has a new job, and as part of his training, he needs to learn certain tasks. One of these tasks is to separate the corn from the chaff. Step 2: Analyze the task Separating the corn from the chaff is a process where the valuable, edible part of the grain (corn) is separated from the worthless, inedible part (chaff). Step 3: Identify the purpose of the task Since Lee is doing this task as part of his job, it's related to the industry he is working in. The context suggests that the objective is to use each part—corn and chaff—separately, indicating that they have different purposes or uses. Step 4: Justify the decision Lee did this task because it is essential to separate the valuable corn from the chaff so that they can be used individually for their specific purposes. It's likely that the corn is used for food or other products, while the chaff might be recycled or used for a different purpose, such as animal bedding or biofuel.

The battle took place in Vågen (meaning \\"the bay, voe\\" in Norwegian), the main port area of neutral Bergen, Norway. Due to a delay in orders the Norwegian commanders took the side of the Dutch, contrary to the secret intentions of the King of Norway and Denmark. The battle ended with the defeat of the English fleet, which retreated, much damaged but without losing any ships. The treasure fleet was relieved by the Dutch home fleet seventeen days later. - The Second Anglo-Dutch War (4 March 1665 31 July 1667) was a conflict fought between England and the United Provinces for control over the seas and trade routes, where England tried to end the Dutch domination of world trade during a period of intense European commercial rivalry.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

The term was coined in 1808 by the early nineteenth century German educational reformer and theologian Friedrich Niethammer and gradually adopted into English. Niethammer had wished to introduce into German education the humane values of ancient Greece and Rome. Niethhammer was a Lutheran theologian. Since the twentieth century, however, Anglophone humanist movements have usually been aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world. - Norwegian literature is literature composed in Norway or by Norwegian people. The history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr Skáldaspillir.

Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - Johan Caspar von Cicignon (c. 1625 - 12 December 1696) was a Luxembourg-born soldier and military engineer who spent most of his career in the service of DenmarkNorway. He is most associated with the reconstruction of Trondheim, Norway after the great fire of 1681. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others).

This involves truly engaging with that individual, getting to know them, and demonstrating your admiration or appreciation for something they excel in, take pride in, or put effort into. Putting it all together, your compliment will leave a lasting impression and contribute positively to their self-esteem and well-being. To craft a powerful compliment, follow these key guidelines: 1. Be observant: Pay attention to the person's actions, qualities, interests, or aspirations. Note down any unique or admirable traits, things they excel in, or moments where they shine. 2. Be specific: Once you've identified something praiseworthy, try to be as precise as possible in your compliment. Mention the specific aspect or quality that impressed or inspired you, ensuring that the person understands what exactly you appreciate about them. 3. Be genuine: Make sure your compliment comes from an authentic place and is not motivated by any ulterior motives. People are generally adept at detecting insincere flattery, so it's crucial to genuinely believe what you are saying. If your compliment is heartfelt and sincere, it's more likely the person will feel encouraged and valued. 4. Be timely: Offer your compliment when the situation is relevant and appropriate. For example, if you were impressed by a co-worker's presentation, don't wait days or weeks to mention it; the impact of your compliment may have significantly decreased by then. Give your compliment soon after you notice their positive attribute, effort, or achievement. 5. Be mindful of context: Respect the person's cultural and social preferences when giving a compliment. Some people may feel overwhelmed or embarrassed when receiving compliments, so it's essential to gauge their comfort level and adjust your approach accordingly. Whether you offer your compliment in private or in front of others, be considerate of the individual's preferences. 6. Be confident: Confidence in delivering your compliment is vital. Maintain eye contact, use a clear and steady voice, and be sure to smile while offering your compliment. Your confidence will communicate the sincerity of your message, ensuring the recipient takes it to heart. In conclusion, giving a powerful compliment involves recognizing and appreciating someone's efforts, achievements, or qualities by being observant, genuine, specific, timely, and mindful of context. By following these guidelines, you can make a positive and lasting impact on the person you're complimenting, strengthening your relationship and contributing to their personal growth. Remember that effective compliments can inspire people to be better versions of themselves and leave them with a lasting sense of pride and accomplishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They had noticed that Tivo had dropped the lifetime fee for multi-service households from 399 to 299. The narrator, being part of a multi-service household, wanted to ensure that they could take advantage of this reduced fee before signing up for the service. Evidently, they had been following the pricing changes closely, perhaps because the pricing and fees associated with Tivo's services were important factors in their decision-making process. They might have been comparing Tivo's offers with those of other service providers, or they may have been waiting for a more budget-friendly deal before they committed to using the service. Knowing that the previously higher fees might no longer be applicable prompted the narrator to contact Tivo and inquire about whether they can apply this 100 discount to their own account. This step demonstrates their initiative in seeking out the most favorable terms for themselves to ensure they are getting the best possible deal for their multi-service household. In summary, the narrator contacted Tivo to gather information about and potentially negotiate their lifetime fees based on the news of a reduced fee for multi-service households. By doing so, they hoped to secure the lower service fee of 299 before finalizing their decision to sign up for a Tivo service plan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

După căderea Zidului Berlinului în anul 1989, lumea s-a așteptat la o deschidere mai mare a frontierelor și la o consolidare a legăturilor și a cooperării dintre țările europene.

Acest fapt a condus la accentuarea diviziunilor și a conflictelor în zonă. Responsabilitatea tuturor, diferitelor țări și instituții internaționale, este să contribuie activ la demantelarea acestor ziduri ale vizelor și la a facilita libera circulație a persoanelor, bunurilor și serviciilor în Balcanii de Vest, sporind astfel schimburile culturale, politice și economice între diferitele state și a regiunii în ansamblul său.

Please answer the following question: Background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Paragraph: Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which class of animals would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Answer:","completion":"From the information provided in the text, the class of animals that would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams would be class A. Class A in the context defined by Mike corresponds to reptiles. It's mentioned in the text that the heart of reptiles resembles that of amphibians, but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. Therefore, reptiles, or in Mike's categorization, class A, would have better separation of these bloodstreams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Determine the sentiment: I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. If I'd been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. He's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this statement, let's analyze it step-by-step. 1. \\"I enjoyed this film.\\" - positive sentiment. 2. \\"But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy.\\" - neutral sentiment with a hint of confusion. 3. \\"It was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all.\\" - mixed sentiment (amusing is positive, not funny is negative). 4. \\"If I'd been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging.\\" -mixed sentiment (disappointed is negative, enjoyable and engaging are positive). 5. \\"Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist.\\" -positive sentiment. 6. \\"I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention.\\" -neutral sentiment, explaining preference. 7. \\"He's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention.\\" - positive sentiment. 8. \\"So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.\\" -neutral sentiment, sharing an opinion.
